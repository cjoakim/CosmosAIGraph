# Unit Tests

This directory contains **unit tests** which are based on
the **pytest** library; see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/

These tests had a 100% passing rate before the recent
addition of the Cosmos DB NoSQL code and related refactoring
of the codebase related to async/await asynchronous programming.

This refactoring is taking place in **late August 2024**.  It is 
expected that the unit tests will return to a 100% passing
rate in September.
