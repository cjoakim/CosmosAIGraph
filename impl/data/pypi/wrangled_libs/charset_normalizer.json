offer better performance than its counterpart chardet. here are some numbers.\n\n| package                                       | accuracy | mean per file (ms) | file per sec (est)

poor. expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. more details on used files, see gha workflows.\n> and yes, these results might change at any time. the dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> the actual delays heavily depends on your cpu capabilities. the factors should remain the same.\n> keep in mind that the stats are generous and that chardet accuracy vs our is measured using chardet initial capability\n> (eg. supported encoding) challenge-them if you want.\n\n## \u2728 installation\n\nusing pip:\n\n```sh\npip

for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## \ud83d\ude07 why\n\nwhen i started using chardet, i noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and i wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. also! i never back down on a good challenge!\n\ni **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nwhat i want is to get readable text, the best i can. \n\nin a way, **i'm brute forcing text decoding.** how cool is that ? \ud83d\ude0e\n\ndon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## \ud83c\udf70 how\n\n  - discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **you ?**\n\n*noise :* i opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **i observed**, then\n**i established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess.\n i know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*coherence :* for each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). so i thought\nthat intel is worth something here. so i use those records against decoded text to check if i can detect intelligent design.\n\n## \u26a1 known limitations\n\n  - language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. html (english tags) + turkish content (sharing latin characters))\n  - every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. in common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f about python eols\n\n**if you are running:**\n\n- python >=2.7,<3.5: unsupported\n- python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n- python 3.7: charset-normalizer < 4.0\n\nupgrade your python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## \ud83d\udc64 contributing\n\ncontributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nfeel
