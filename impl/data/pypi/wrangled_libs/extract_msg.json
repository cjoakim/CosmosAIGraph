(default: current directory)\r\n       --use-filename        sets whether the name of each output is based on the msg filename.\r\n       --dump-stdout         tells the program to dump the message body (plain text) to stdout. overrides saving arguments.\r\n       --html                sets whether the output should be html. if this is not possible, will error.\r\n       --pdf                 saves the body as a pdf. if this is not possible, will error.\r\n       --wk-path wkpath      overrides the path for finding wkhtmltopdf.\r\n       --wk-options [wkoptions ...]\r\n                             sets additional options to be used in wkhtmltopdf. should be a series of options and values, replacing the - or -- in the beginning with + or ++, respectively. for example: --wk-options \"+o landscape\"\r\n       --prepared-html       when used in conjunction with --html, sets whether the html output should be prepared for embedded attachments.\r\n       --charset charset     character set to use for the prepared html in the added tag. (default: utf-8)\r\n       --raw                 sets whether the output should be raw. if this is not possible, will error.\r\n       --rtf                 sets whether the output should be rtf. if this is not possible, will error.\r\n       --allow-fallback      tells the program to fallback to a different save type if the selected one is not possible.\r\n       --skip-body-not-found\r\n                             skips saving the body if the body cannot be found, rather than throwing an error.\r\n       --zip zip             path to use for saving to a zip file.\r\n       --save-header         store the header in a separate file.\r\n       --attachments-only    specify to only save attachments from an msg file.\r\n       --skip-hidden         skips any attachment marked as hidden (usually ones embedded in the body).\r\n       --no-folders          stores everything in the location specified by --out. requires --attachments-only and is incompatible with --out-name.\r\n       --skip-embedded       skips all embedded msg files when saving attachments.\r\n       --extract-embedded    extracts the embedded msg files as msg files instead of running their save functions.\r\n       --overwrite-existing  disables filename conflict resolution code for attachments when saving a file, causing files to be overwriten if two attachments with the same filename are on an msg file.\r\n       --skip-not-implemented, --skip-ni\r\n                             skips any attachments that are not implemented, allowing saving of the rest of the message.\r\n       --out-name outname    name to be used with saving the file output. cannot be used if you are saving more than one file.\r\n       --glob, --wildcard    interpret all paths as having wildcards. incompatible with --out-name.\r\n       --ignore-rtfde        ignores all errors thrown from rtfde when trying to save. useful for allowing fallback to continue when an exception happens.\r\n       --progress            shows what file the program is currently working on during it's progress.\r\n\r\n**to use this in your own script**, start by using:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n     import extract_msg\r\n\r\nfrom there, open the msg file:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n     msg = extract_msg.openmsg(\"path/to/msg/file.msg\")\r\n\r\nalternatively, if you wish to send a msg binary string instead of a file\r\nto the ``extract_msg.openmsg`` method:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n     msg_raw = b'\\xd0\\xcf\\x11\\xe0\\xa1\\xb1\\x1a\\xe1\\x00 ... \\x00\\x00\\x00'\r\n     msg = extract_msg.openmsg(msg_raw)\r\n\r\nif you want to override the default attachment class and use one of your\r\nown, simply change the code to:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n     msg = extract_msg.openmsg(\"path/to/msg/file.msg\", attachmentclass = customattachmentclass)\r\n\r\nwhere ``customattachmentclass`` is your custom class.\r\n\r\n#todo: finish this section\r\n\r\nif you have any questions feel free to contact destiny at arceusthe [at]\r\ngmail [dot] com. she is the co-owner and main developer of the project.\r\n\r\nif you have issues, it would be best to get help for them by opening a\r\nnew github issue.\r\n\r\nerror reporting\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nshould you encounter an error that has not already been reported, please\r\ndo the following when reporting it: \\* make sure you are using the\r\nlatest version of extract_msg (check the version on pypi). \\* state your\r\npython version. \\* include the code, if any, that you used. \\* include a\r\ncopy of the traceback.\r\n\r\nsupporting the module\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nif you'd like to donate to help support the development of the module, you can\r\ndonate to destiny using one of the following services:\r\n\r\n* `buy me a coffee`_\r\n* `ko-fi`_\r\n* `patreon`_\r\n\r\ninstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nyou can install using pip:\r\n\r\n-  pypi\r\n\r\n.. code:: bash\r\n\r\n       pip install extract-msg\r\n\r\n-  github\r\n\r\n.. code:: sh\r\n\r\n     pip install git+https://github.com/teammsgextractor/msg-extractor\r\n\r\nor you can include this in your list of python dependencies with:\r\n\r\n.. code:: python\r\n\r\n   # setup.py\r\n\r\n   setup(\r\n       ...\r\n       dependency_links=['https://github.com/teammsgextractor/msg-extractor/zipball/master'],\r\n   )\r\n\r\nadditionally, this module has the following extras which can be optionally\r\ninstalled:\r\n\r\n* ``all``: installs all of the extras.\r\n* ``mime``: installs dependency used for mimetype generation when a mimetype is not specified.\r\n\r\nversioning\r\n----------\r\n\r\nthis module uses semantic versioning, however it has not always done so. all versions greater than or equal to 0.40.* conform successfully. as the package is currently in major version zero (0.*.*), anything may change at any time, as per point 4 of the semver specification. however, i, destiny, am aware of the module's usage in other packages and code, and so i have taken efforts to make the versioning more reliable.\r\n\r\nany change to the minor version must be considered a potentially breaking change, and the changelog should be checked before assuming the api will function in the way it did in the previous minor version. i do, however, try to keep the api relatively stable between minor versions, so most typical usage is likely to remain entirely unaffected.\r\n\r\nany change to a patch version before the 1.0.0 release should either add functionality or have no visible difference in usage, aside from changes to the typing infomation or from a bug fix correcting the data that a component created.\r\n\r\nin addition to the above conditions, it must be noted that any class, variable, function, etc., that is preceded by one or more underscores, excluding items preceded by two underscores and also proceeded by two underscores, must not be considered part of the public api. these methods may change at any time, in any way.\r\n\r\ni am aware of the f.a.q. question that suggests that i should probably have pushed the module to a 1.0.0 release due to its usage in production, however there are a number of different items on the todo list that i feel should be completed before that time. while some are simply important features i believe should exist, others are overhauls to sections of the public api that have needed careful fixing for quite a while, fixes that have slowly been happening throughout the versions. an important change was made in the 0.45.0 release which deprecates a large number of commonly used private functions and created more stable versions of them in the public api.\r\n\r\nadditionally, my focus on versioning info has revealed that some of the dependencies are still in major version 0 *or* do not necessarily conform to semantic versioning. as such, these packages are more tightly constrained on what versions are considered acceptable, and careful consideration should be taken before extending the accepted range of versions.\r\n\r\ndetails on semantic versioning can be found at `semver.org`_.\r\n\r\ntodo\r\n----\r\n\r\nhere is a list of things that are currently on our todo list:\r\n\r\n* tests (ie. unittest)\r\n* finish writing a usage guide\r\n* improve the intelligence of the saving functions\r\n* improve readme\r\n* create a wiki for advanced usage information\r\n\r\ncredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\n`destiny peterson (the elemental of destruction)`_ - co-owner, principle programmer, knows more about msg files than anyone probably should.\r\n\r\n`matthew walker`_ - original developer and co-owner.\r\n\r\n`jp bourget`_ - senior programmer, readability and organization expert, secondary manager.\r\n\r\n`philippe lagadec`_ - python olefile module developer.\r\n\r\n`joel kaufman`_ - first implementations of the json and filename flags.\r\n\r\n`dean malmgren`_ - first implementation of the setup.py script.\r\n\r\n`seamus tuohy`_ - developer of the python rtfde module. gave first examples of how to use the module and has worked with destiny to ensure functionality.\r\n\r\n`liam`_ - significant reorganization and transfer of data.\r\n\r\nand thank you to everyone who has opened an issue and helped us track down those pesky bugs.\r\n\r\nextra\r\n-----\r\n\r\ncheck out the new project `msg-explorer`_ that allows you to open msg files and\r\nexplore their contents in a gui. it is usually updated within a few days of a\r\nmajor release to ensure continued support. because of this, it is recommended to\r\ninstall it to a separate environment (like a vitural env) to not interfere with\r\nyour access to the newest major version of extract-msg.\r\n\r\n.. |license: gpl v3| image::
