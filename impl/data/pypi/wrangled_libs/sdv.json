your one-stop shop for\ncreating tabular synthetic data. the sdv uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to learn\npatterns from your real data and emulate them in synthetic data.\n\n## features\n:brain: **create synthetic data using machine learning.** the sdv offers multiple models, ranging\nfrom classical statistical methods (gaussiancopula) to deep learning methods (ctgan). generate\ndata for single tables, multiple connected tables or sequential tables.\n\n:bar_chart: **evaluate and visualize data.** compare the synthetic data to the real data against a\nvariety of measures. diagnose problems and generate a quality report to get more insights.\n\n:arrows_counterclockwise: **preprocess, anonymize and define constraints.** control data\nprocessing to improve the quality of synthetic data, choose from different types of anonymization\nand define business rules in the form of logical constraints.\n\n| important links                               |

https://github.com/sdv-dev/sdv/blob/stable/docs/images/google_colab.png\n[tutorials]: https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/demos\n\n# install\nthe sdv is publicly available under the [business source license](https://github.com/sdv-dev/sdv/blob/main/license).\ninstall sdv using pip or conda. we recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with\nother software on your device.\n\n```bash\npip install sdv\n```\n\n```bash\nconda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge sdv\n```\n\n# getting started\nload a demo dataset to get started. this dataset is a single table describing guests staying at a\nfictional hotel.\n\n```python\nfrom sdv.datasets.demo import download_demo\n\nreal_data, metadata = download_demo(\n    modality='single_table',\n    dataset_name='fake_hotel_guests')\n```\n\n![single table metadata example](https://github.com/sdv-dev/sdv/blob/stable/docs/images/single-table-metadata-example.png)\n\nthe demo also includes **metadata**, a description of the dataset, including the data types in each\ncolumn and the primary key (`guest_email`).\n\n## synthesizing data\nnext, we can create an **sdv synthesizer**,  an object that you can use to create synthetic data.\nit learns patterns from the real data and replicates them to generate synthetic data. let's use\nthe `fast_ml` preset synthesizer, which is optimized for performance.\n\n```python\nfrom sdv.lite import singletablepreset\n\nsynthesizer = singletablepreset(metadata, name='fast_ml')\nsynthesizer.fit(data=real_data)\n```\n\nand now the synthesizer is ready to create synthetic data!\n\n```python\nsynthetic_data = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=500)\n```\n\nthe synthetic data will have the following properties:\n- **sensitive columns are fully anonymized.** the email, billing address and credit card number\ncolumns contain new data so you don't expose the real values.\n- **other columns follow statistical patterns.** for example, the proportion of room types, the\ndistribution of check in dates and the correlations between room rate and room type are preserved.\n- **keys and other relationships are intact.** the primary key (guest email) is unique for each row.\nif you have multiple tables, the connection between a primary and foreign keys makes sense.\n\n## evaluating synthetic data\nthe sdv library allows you to evaluate the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data. get\nstarted by generating a quality report.\n\n```python\nfrom sdv.evaluation.single_table import evaluate_quality\n\nquality_report = evaluate_quality(\n    real_data,\n    synthetic_data,\n    metadata)\n```\n\n```\ncreating report: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 4/4 [00:00<00:00, 19.30it/s]\noverall quality score: 89.12%\nproperties:\ncolumn shapes: 90.27%\ncolumn pair trends: 87.97%\n```\n\nthis object computes an overall quality score on a scale of 0 to 100% (100 being the best) as well\nas detailed breakdowns. for more insights, you can also visualize the synthetic vs. real data.\n\n```python\nfrom sdv.evaluation.single_table import get_column_plot\n\nfig = get_column_plot(\n    real_data=real_data,\n    synthetic_data=synthetic_data,\n    column_name='amenities_fee',\n    metadata=metadata\n)\n    \nfig.show()\n```\n\n![real vs. synthetic data](https://github.com/sdv-dev/sdv/blob/stable/docs/images/real-vs-synthetic-evaluation.png)\n\n# what's next?\nusing the sdv library, you can synthesize single table, multi table and sequential data. you can\nalso customize the full synthetic data workflow, including preprocessing, anonymization and adding\nconstraints.\n\nto learn more, visit the [sdv demo

2023-12-05\n\nthis release adds support for the new diagnostic report from sdmetrics. this report calculates scores for three basic but important properties of your data: data validity, data structure and in the multi table case, relationship validity. data validity checks that the columns of your data are valid (eg. correct range or values). data structure makes sure the synthetic data has the correct columns. relationship validity checks to make sure key references are correct and the cardinality is within ranges seen in the real data.\n\nadditionally, a few bugs were fixed and functionality was improved around synthesizers. it is now possible to access the loss values for the `tvaesynthesizer` and `ctgansynthesizer` by using the `get_loss_values` method. the `get_parameters` method is now more detailed and returns all the parameters used to make a synthesizer. the metadata is now capable of detecting some common pii sdtypes. finally, a bug that made every parent row generated by the `hmasynthesizer` have at least one child row was patched. this should improve cardinality.\n\n### maintenance\n\n* address `settingwithcopywarning` (hmasynthesizer) -

2023-08-23\n\nthis release makes multiple improvements to the metadata. both the single and multi table metadata classes now have a `validate_data` method. this method runs checks to validate the data against the current specifications in the metadata. the `singletablemetadata.visualize` is also improved. the sequence index is now shown in the same section as the sequence key. it also now shows all key and index information (eg. sequence key, primary key, sequence index) in one section.\n\nthe `ctgansynthesizer` has been made more efficient in the following ways:\n1. boolean columns are now being skipped during `preprocess` like categorial columns are.\n2. it is possible to apply other transformations to categorical columns and have `ctgan` skip the one-hot encoding step.\n\nadditional changes include that the columns labeled with the sdtype `id` will now go through the `idgenerator` transformer by default and constraint transformations that were being overwritten during sampling will now be respected.\n\n### new features\n\n* add validate_data method to metadata - issue [#1518](https://github.com/sdv-dev/sdv/issues/1518) by @fealho\n* use idgenerator for id columns - issue [#1519](https://github.com/sdv-dev/sdv/issues/1519) by @frances-h\n* metadata visualization for sequential data: only create 2 sections -

issue [#1356](https://github.com/sdv-dev/sdv/issues/1356) by @r-palazzo\n\n## 1.0.0 - 2023-03-28\n\nthis is a major release that introduces a new api to the `sdv` aimed at streamlining the process of synthetic data generation! to achieve this, this release includes the addition of several large features.\n\n### metadata\n\nsome of the most notable additions are the new `singletablemetadata` and `multitablemetadata` classes. these classes enable a number of features that make it easier to synthesize your data correctly such as:\n\n* automatic data detection - calling `metadata.detect_from_dataframe()` or `metadata.detect_from_csv()` will populate the metadata autonomously with values it thinks represent the data.\n* easy updating - once an instance of the metadata is created, values can be easily updated using a number of methods defined in the api. for more info, view the [docs](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/data-preparation/single-table-metadata-api).\n* metadata validation - calling `metadata.validate()` will return a report of any invalid definitions in the metadata specification.\n* upgrading - users with the previous metadata format can easily update to the new specification using the `upgrade_metadata()` method.\n* saving and loading - the metadata itself can easily be saved to a json file and loaded back up later.\n\n### class and module names\n\nanother major change is the renaming of our core modeling classes and modules. the name changes are meant to highlight the difference between the underlying machine learning models, and the objects responsible for the end-to-end workflow of generating synthetic data. the main name changes are as follows:\n* `tabular` -> `single_table`\n* `relational` -> `multi_table`\n* `timeseries` -> `sequential`\n* `basetabularmodel` -> `basesingletablesynthesizer`\n* `gaussiancopula` -> `gaussiancopulasynthesizer`\n* `ctgan` -> `ctgansynthesizer`\n* `tvae` -> `tvaesynthesizer`\n* `copulagan` -> `copulagansynthesizer`\n* `par` -> `parsynthesizer`\n* `hma1` -> `hmasynthesizer`\n\nin `sdv` 1.0, synthesizers are classes that take in metadata and handle data preprocessing, model training and model sampling. this is similar to the previous `basetabularmodel` in `sdv` <1.0.\n\n### synthetic data workflow\n\n`synthesizers` in `sdv` 1.0 define a clear workflow for generating synthetic data.\n1. synthesizers are initialized with a metadata class.\n2. they can then be used to transform the data and apply constraints using the `synthesizer.preprocess()` method. this step also validates that the data matches the provided metadata to avoid errors in fitting or sampling.\n3. the processed data can then be fed into the underlying machine learning model using `synthesizer.fit_processed_data()`. (alternatively, data can be preprocessed and fit to the model using `synthesizer.fit()`.)\n4. data can then be sampled using `synthesizer.sample()`.\n\neach synthesizer class also provides a series of methods to help users customize the transformations their data goes through. read more about that [here](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthetic-data-workflow/transform-and-anonymize).\n\nnotice that the preprocessing and model fitting steps can now be separated. this can be helpful if preprocessing is time consuming or if the data has been processed externally.\n\n### other highly requested features\n\nanother major addition is control over randomization. in `sdv` <1.0, users could set a seed to control the randomization for only some columns. in `sdv` 1.0, randomization is controlled for all columns. every new call to sample generates new data, but the synthesizer's seed can be reset to the original state using `synthesizer.reset_randomization()`, enabling reproducibility.\n\n`sdv 1.0` adds accessibility and transparency into the transformers used for preprocessing and underlying machine learning models.\n* using the `synthesizer.get_transformers()` method, you can access the transformers used to preprocess each column and view their properties. this can be useful for debugging and accessing privacy information like mappings used to mask data.\n* distribution parameters learned by copula models can be accessed using the `synthesizer.get_learned_distributions()` method.\n\npii handling is improved by the following features:\n* primary keys can be set to natural sdtypes (eg. ssn, email, name). previously they could only be numerical or text.\n* the `pseudoanonymizedfaker` can be used to provide consistent mapping to pii columns. as mentioned before, the mapping itself can be accessed by viewing the transformers for the column using `synthesizer.get_transformers()`.\n* a bug causing pii columns to slow down modeling is patched.\n\nfinally, the synthetic data can now be easily evaluated using the `evaluate_quality()` and `run_diagnostic()` methods. the data can be compared visually to the actual data using the `get_column_plot()` and `get_column_pair_plot()` methods. for more info on how to visualize or interpret the synthetic data evaluation, read the docs [here](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/evaluation).\n\n### issues resolved\n\n#### new features\n\n* change auto_assign_transformers to handle id types -

2022-07-21\n\nthis release brings user friendly improvements and bug fixes on the `sdv` constraints, to help\nusers generate their synthetic data easily.\n\nsome predefined constraints have been renamed and redefined to be more user friendly & consistent.\nthe custom constraint api has also been updated for usability. the sdv now automatically determines\nthe best `handling_strategy` to use for each constraint, attempting `transform` by default and\nfalling back to `reject_sampling` otherwise. the `handling_strategy` parameters are no longer\nincluded in the api.\n\nfinally, this version of `sdv` also unifies the parameters for all sampling related methods for\nall models (including tabularpreset).\n\n### changes to constraints\n\n* `greatherthan` constraint is now separated in two new constraints: `inequality`, which is\n  intended to be used between two columns, and `scalarinequality`, which is intended to be used\n  between a column and a scalar.\n\n* `between` constraint is now separated in two new constraints: `range`, which is intended to\n  be used between three columns, and `scalarrange`, which is intended to be used between a column\n  and low and high scalar values.\n\n* `fixedincrements` a new constraint that makes the data increment by a certain value.\n* new `create_custom_constraint` function available to create custom constraints.\n\n### removed constraints\n* `rounding` rounding is automatically being handled by the ``rdt.hypertransformer``.\n* `columnformula` the `create_custom_constraint` takes place over this one and allows more\n  advanced usage for the end users.\n\n### new features\n\n* improve error message for invalid constraints -
