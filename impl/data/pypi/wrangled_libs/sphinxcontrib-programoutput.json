https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/workflows/tests/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/actions?query=workflow%3atests\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/badge.svg\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput\n\n\nhttps://sphinxcontrib-programoutput.readthedocs.org\n\na sphinx_ extension to literally insert the output of arbitrary commands into\ndocuments, helping you to keep your command examples up to date.\n\n\ninstallation\n============\n\ninstall this extension from pypi_::\n\n   pip install sphinxcontrib-programoutput\n\nthe extension requires sphinx 1.7.0 and python 2.7 or python 3 (python\n3.6+ is tested) at least.\n\nusage\n=====\n\njust add this extension to ``extensions``::\n\n   extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.programoutput']\n\nnow you've two new directives ``program-output`` and ``command-output`` to\ninsert the output of programs.  the former just inserts the output::\n\n   .. program-output:: python -v\n\noutput::\n\n   python 2.7.1\n\nthe latter directive mimics a shell session, and is intended to show examples::\n\n   .. command-output:: python -v\n\noutput::\n\n   $ python -v\n   python 2.7.1\n\n\nplease refer to the documentation_ for comprehensive information about usage and\nconfiguration of this extension.\n\n\ndevelopment and support\n=======================\n\nplease refer to the documentation_ for information on support and the\ndevelopment process.\n\n\n.. _sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/\n.. _pypi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-programoutput\n.. _documentation: http://sphinxcontrib-programoutput.readthedocs.org\n\n\n=========\n changes\n=========\n\n0.17 (2021-03-31)\n=================\n\n- add support for python 3.9.\n\n- drop support for python 3.5.\n\n- include program output and current working directory in the warning\n  logged when a program returns an unexpected return code. suggested\n  by sorin sbarnea. see `issue 50\n  <https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/50>`_.\n\n\n0.16 (2020-03-23)\n=================\n\n- add ``name`` and ``caption`` options. added in\n  `pr 41 <https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/pull/41>`_\n  by rapha\u00ebl.\n- add support for python 3.8.\n\n\n0.15 (2019-09-16)\n=================\n\n- make the test suite stop assuming the presence of a 'python'\n  executable on the path. instead it uses ``sys.executable`` (which\n  shouldn't have spaces). note that it does continue to assume the\n  presence of other executables, such as 'echo'. reported in `issue 38\n  <https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/38>`_\n  by john vandenberg.\n\n\n0.14 (2019-04-08)\n=================\n\n- add ``python_requires`` metadata to better allow tools like ``pip``\n  to install a correct version.\n\n- add support for sphinx 2.0 on python 3.\n\n- avoid unicode errors when the program command or output produced\n  non-ascii output and the configured prompt was a byte string. this\n  was most likely under python 2, where the default configured prompt\n  is a byte string. reported by, and patch inspired by, `issue 33\n  <https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/33>`_\n  by latricewilgus.\n\n0.13 (2018-12-22)\n=================\n\n- drop support for sphinx < 1.7.\n\n- fix tests on sphinx >= 1.8.0.\n\n- restore error message into the document by default from failed\n  program runs on sphinx >= 1.8.0b1.\n\n- fix deprecation warnings on sphinx >= 1.8. reported in `issue 29\n  <https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/29>`_\n  by miili.\n\n\n0.11 (2017-05-18)\n=================\n\n- explicitly set ``parallel_read_safe`` to true in the extension\n  metadata. see `issue 25\n  <https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/25>`_.\n  with thanks to adam j. stewart and stephen mcdowell.\n\n0.10 (2017-03-17)\n=================\n\n- decode output from the program tolerantly, using the 'replace'\n  handler. based on a `pull request\n  <https://github.com/habnabit/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/commit/592078e0386c2a36d50a6528b6e49d91707138bf>`_\n  by stefan c. m\u00fcller.\n\n\n0.9 (2017-03-15)\n================\n\n- forked and revived the project in `gitub\n  <https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput>`_.\n\n- run the tests on travis ci. formatting and style is enforced by pylint.\n\n- the oldest supported and tested sphinx version is now 1.3.5. see\n  `issue 17\n  <https://github.com/nextthought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/17>`_.\n\n\n- remove support for python 2.6, python 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n- 100% test coverage.\n\n- remove support for ``programoutput_use_ansi``. the\n  ``sphinxcontrib.ansi`` extension is no longer available on pypi.\n\n0.8 (oct 12, 2012)\n==================\n\n- migrated to github\n\n\n0.7 (apr 17, 2012)\n==================\n\n- added ``cwd`` option to ``..program-output``\n- working directory of executed programs defaults to documentation root now\n\n\n0.6 (jan 07, 2012)\n==================\n\n- python 3 support\n- require sphinx 1.1 now\n\n\n0.5 (sep 19, 2011)\n==================\n\n- ``programoutput_prompt_template`` is interpreted as format string now!\n- require python 2.6 now\n- added ``returncode`` option to ``program-output`` (thanks to\n  jan-marek glogowski)\n- support ``returncode`` formatting key in\n  ``programoutput_prompt_template``\n- warn on unexpected return codes instead of raising\n  ``subprocess.calledprocesserror``\n- turn fatal errors during command into document error messages\n  instead of crashing the build\n\n\n0.4.1 (mar 11, 2011)\n====================\n\n- some source code cleanups\n- fixed installation instructions in documentation\n\n\n0.4 (may 21, 2010)\n==================\n\n- initial release\n\n\n",
