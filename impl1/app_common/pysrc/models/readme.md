# readme for models directory

The naming convention used here is:

- **Model** classes refer to **Pydantic models**
  - these are the return type from FastAPI endpoints for automatic OpenAI/Swagger documentation

- **Result** classes refer to a regular Python object datastructure
  - these are intermediate object not directly returned by FastAPI endpoints
