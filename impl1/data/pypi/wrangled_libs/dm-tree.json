  "description": "# tree\n\n`tree` is a library for working with nested data structures. in a way, `tree`\ngeneralizes the builtin `map` function which only supports flat sequences,\nand allows to apply a function to each \"leaf\" preserving the overall\nstructure.\n\n```python\n>>> import tree\n>>> structure = [[1], [[[2, 3]]], [4]]\n>>> tree.flatten(structure)\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n>>> tree.map_structure(lambda v: v**2, structure)\n[[1], [[[4, 9]]], [16]]\n```\n\n`tree` is backed by an optimized c++ implementation suitable for use in\ndemanding applications, such as machine learning models.\n\n## installation\n\nfrom pypi:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install dm-tree\n```\n\ndirectly from github using pip:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install git+git://github.com/deepmind/tree.git\n```\n\nbuild from source:\n\n```shell\n$ python setup.py install\n```\n\n## support\n\nif you are having issues, please let us know by filing an issue on our\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/deepmind/tree/issues).\n\n## license\n\nthe project is licensed under the apache 2.0 license.\n",
