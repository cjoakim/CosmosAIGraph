  "description": "# looseversion - version numbering for anarchists and software realists\n\na backwards/forwards-compatible fork of `distutils.version.looseversion`,\nfor times when pep-440 isn't what you need.\n\nthe goal of this package is to be a drop-in replacement for the original `looseversion`.\nit implements an identical interface and comparison logic to `looseversion`.\nthe only major change is that a `looseversion.looseversion` is comparable to a\n`distutils.version.looseversion`, which means tools should not need to worry whether\nall dependencies that use looseversion have migrated.\n\nif you are simply comparing versions of python packages, consider moving to\n[packaging.version.version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.version),\nwhich follows [pep-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440).\n`looseversion` is better suited to interacting with heterogeneous version schemes that\ndo not follow pep-440.\n\n## installation\n\n### from pypi\n\n```\npip install looseversion\n```\n\n### from source\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/effigies/looseversion.git\npip install looseversion/\n```\n\n## usage\n\n```python\n>>> from looseversion import looseversion\n>>> looseversion(\"1.0.0\") < looseversion(\"2.0.0\")\ntrue\n>>> looseversion(\"1.0.0\") < \"2\"\ntrue\n```\n",
