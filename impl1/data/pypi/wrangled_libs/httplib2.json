  "description": "\n\na comprehensive http client library, ``httplib2`` supports many features left out of other http libraries.\n\n**http and https**\n  https support is only available if the socket module was compiled with ssl support.\n\n\n**keep-alive**\n  supports http 1.1 keep-alive, keeping the socket open and performing multiple requests over the same connection if possible.\n\n\n**authentication**\n  the following three types of http authentication are supported. these can be used over both http and https.\n\n  * digest\n  * basic\n  * wsse\n\n**caching**\n  the module can optionally operate with a private cache that understands the cache-control:\n  header and uses both the etag and last-modified cache validators. both file system\n  and memcached based caches are supported.\n\n\n**all methods**\n  the module can handle any http request method, not just get and post.\n\n\n**redirects**\n  automatically follows 3xx redirects on gets.\n\n\n**compression**\n  handles both 'deflate' and 'gzip' types of compression.\n\n\n**lost update support**\n  automatically adds back etags into put requests to resources we have already cached. this implements section 3.2 of detecting the lost update problem using unreserved checkout\n\n\n**unit tested**\n  a large and growing set of unit tests.\n",
