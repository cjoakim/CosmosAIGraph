  "description": "xattr\n-----\n\nxattr is a python wrapper for extended filesystem attributes.\n\nxattr also ships with an `xattr` command line tool for viewing and\nediting extended filesystem attributes. on platforms that support or\nship with the attr package, you may prefer to use the `getfattr`\nand `setfattr` command line tools from the attr package.\n\nextended attributes extend the basic attributes of files and directories\nin the file system.  they are stored as name:data pairs associated with\nfile system objects (files, directories, symlinks, etc).\n\nextended attributes are currently only available on darwin 8.0+ (mac os x 10.4)\nand linux 2.6+. experimental support is included for solaris and freebsd.\n\npython 3.8+ is required as of v1.0.0, and this is the minimum version\nthat is compatible with python 3.12+.\n\nversions older than v1.0.0 are no longer supported, but are\navailable for use. v0.10.1 is the last version to support older versions\nof python (including 2.7).\n\nnote: on linux, custom xattr keys need to be prefixed with the `user`\nnamespace, ie: `user.your_attr`.\n\nnote: if you need to read or write spotlight metadata attributes on macos,\nsee osxmetadata_ which provides a native macos means to do so without\ndirectly manipulating extended attributes. osxmetadata also provides access\nto other macos metadata attributes and extended attributes via xattr.\n\n.. _osxmetadata: https://github.com/rhettbull/osxmetadata\n",
