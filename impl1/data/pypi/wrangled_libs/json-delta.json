  "description": "json-delta: a diff/patch pair and library for json data\nstructures. (http://json_delta.readthedocs.org/)\n\njson-delta is a multi-language software suite for computing deltas\nbetween json-serialized data structures, and applying those deltas as\npatches.  it enables separate programs at either end of a\ncommunications channel (e.g. client and server over http, or two\nprocesses talking to one another using bidirectional ipc) to\nmanipulate a data structure while minimizing communications overhead.\n\nthis is the python implementation.  it requires python version 2.7 or\nnewer (including python 3).  it can be installed in the standard way:\n\n$ python setup.py install\n\n(potentially needing superuser privileges).  this will install a\nsingle module named json_delta, and scripts named json_diff,\njson_patch and json_cat.\n\nhtml documentation for all four of these can be found in the doc/\ndirectory, along with manpages for the scripts.\n\ndonations to support the continuing development of json-delta will be\ngratefully received via gratipay (https://gratipay.com/phijaro),\npaypal (himself@phil-roberts.name) or\nbitcoin: (`1hpjhrpvsm1y4zrgppd2c6lysjxeabbqn4\n<bitcoin:1hpjhrpvsm1y4zrgppd2c6lysjxeabbqn4>`_).\n\n\n\n",
