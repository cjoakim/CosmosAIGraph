  "description": "about\n-----\n\npython-monkey-business is a package that provides a decorator for\nmonkey-patching python functions at runtime.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nusing pip::\n\n    pip install python-monkey-business\n\nor, to install from source::\n\n    pip install -e git+https://github.com/theatlantic/python-monkey-business.git#egg=python-monkey-business\n\nif the source is already checked out, use setuptools::\n\n    python setup.py develop\n\nusage\n-----\n\nto use python-monkey-business to swap out a function in a class or module at runtime:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import monkeybiz\n\n    from foomodule import fooclass\n    import barmodule\n\n\n    # this replaces fooclass.bar with our method\n    @monkeybiz.patch(fooclass)\n    def bar(original_fn, *args, **kwargs):\n        print \"patched!\"\n        return original_fn(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    # this replaces barmodule.baz with our function\n    @monkeybiz.patch(barmodule)\n    def baz(original_fn, *args, **kwargs):\n        #...\n\nthe first argument to ``monkeybiz.patch`` can be either a module, a class,\nor a list of modules and/or classes. the decorator also takes optional\n``name`` and ``avoid_doublewrap`` keyword arguments. if ``name`` is omitted,\nthe name of the function being patched will be the name of the function being\ndecorated. if ``avoid_doublewrap`` is true (the default), then functions and\nmethods can only be patched once using this function.\n\nuse ``monkeybiz.unpatch()`` to revert a monkey-patched function to its original.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nthis code is licensed under the `simplified bsd\nlicense <http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-2-clause>`_. view the\n``license`` file under the root directory for complete license and\ncopyright information.",
