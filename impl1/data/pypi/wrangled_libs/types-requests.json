  "description": "## typing stubs for requests\n\nthis is a [pep 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)\ntype stub package for the [`requests`](https://github.com/psf/requests) package.\nit can be used by type-checking tools like\n[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),\n[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),\n[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),\npycharm, etc. to check code that uses\n`requests`.\n\nthis version of `types-requests` aims to provide accurate annotations\nfor `requests==2.31.*`.\nthe source for this package can be found at\nhttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/requests. all fixes for\ntypes and metadata should be contributed there.\n\nnote: `types-requests` has required `urllib3>=2` since v2.31.0.7. if you need to install `types-requests` into an environment that must also have `urllib3<2` installed into it, you will have to use `types-requests<2.31.0.7`.\n\nsee https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/readme.md for more details.\nthis package was generated from typeshed commit `1ecaab16415b58750f4908023e49286772996938` and was tested\nwith mypy 1.5.1, pyright 1.1.330, and\npytype 2023.10.17.\n",
