(libsass_ is written in c++.)\n- simple api.  see the below example code for details.\n- custom functions.\n- ``@import`` callbacks.\n- support both tabbed (sass) and braces (scss) syntax.\n- wsgi middleware for ease of development.\n  it automatically compiles sass/scss files for each request.\n- ``setuptools``/``distutils`` integration.\n  you can build all sass/scss files using\n  ``setup.py build_sass`` command.\n- works also on pypy.\n- provides prebuilt wheel_ binaries for linux, windows, and mac.\n\n.. _wheel: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/\n\n\ninstall\n-------\n\nit's available on pypi_, so you can install it using ``pip`` (or\n``easy_install``):\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ pip install libsass\n\n.. note::\n\n   libsass requires some features introduced by the recent c++ standard.\n   you need a c++ compiler that support those features.\n   see also libsass project's readme_ file.\n\n.. _pypi: https://pypi.org/pypi/libsass/\n.. _readme: https://github.com/sass/libsass#readme\n\n\n.. _example:\n\nexample\n-------\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n   >>> import sass\n   >>> print sass.compile(string='a { b { color: blue; } }')\n   a b {\n     color: blue; }\n\n\ndocs\n----\n\nthere's the user guide manual and the full api reference for ``libsass``:\n\nhttps://sass.github.io/libsass-python/\n\nyou can build the docs by yourself:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ cd docs/\n   $ make html\n\nthe built docs will go to ``docs/_build/html/`` directory.\n\n\ncredit\n------\n\nhong minhee wrote this python binding of libsass_.\n\nhampton catlin and aaron leung wrote libsass_, which is portable c/c++\nimplementation of sass_.\n\nhampton catlin originally designed sass_ language and wrote the first\nreference implementation of it in ruby.\n\nthe above three are all distributed under `mit license`_.\n\n.. _mit license: https://mit-license.org/\n",
