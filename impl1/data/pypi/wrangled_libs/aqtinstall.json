https://snyk.io/advisor/python/aqtinstall/badge.svg\n  :target: https://snyk.io/advisor/python/aqtinstall\n  :alt: aqtinstall\n\n\n\nthis is a utility alternative to the official graphical qt installer, for using in ci environment\nwhere an interactive ui is not usable, or just on command line.\n\nit can automatically download prebuilt qt binaries, documents and sources for target specified,\nwhen the versions are on qt download mirror sites.\n\n.. note::\n    because it is an installer utility, it can download from qt distribution site and its mirror.\n    the site is operated by the qt company who may remove versions you may want to use that become end of support.\n    please don't blame us.\n\n.. warning::\n    this is not franchised with the qt company and the qt project. please don't ask them about aqtinstall.\n\n\nlicense and copyright\n---------------------\n\nthis program is distributed under mit license.\n\nqt sdk and its related files are under its licenses. when using aqtinstall, you are considered\nto agree upon qt licenses. **aqtinstall installs qt sdk as of a (l)gpl free software.**\n\nfor details see `qt licensing`_ and `licenses used in qt5`_\n\n.. _`qt licensing`: https://www.qt.io/licensing/\n\n.. _`licenses used in qt5`: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/licenses-used-in-qt.html\n\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\n- minimum python version:\n    3.7\n\n- recommended python version:\n    3.9 (frequently tested on)\n\n- dependencies:\n    requests\n    semantic_version\n    patch\n    py7zr\n    texttable\n    bs4\n    defusedxml\n\n- operating systems:\n    linux, macos, ms windows\n\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nthere is precise documentation with many examples.\nyou are recommended to read the *getting started* section.\n\n- getting started: https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html\n- stable (v3.0.x): https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/stable\n- latest: https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest\n- old (v2.2.3) : https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/v2.2.3/\n\ninstall\n-------\n\nsame as usual, it can be installed with ``pip``:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    pip install -u pip\n    pip install aqtinstall\n\nyou are recommended to update pip before installing aqtinstall.\n\n.. note::\n\n    aqtinstall depends several packages, that is required to download files from internet, and extract 7zip archives,\n    some of which are precompiled in several platforms.\n    older pip does not handle it expectedly(see #230).\n\n.. note::\n\n    when you want to use it on msys2/mingw64 environment, you need to set environmental variable\n    ``export setuptools_use_distutils=stdlib``, because of setuptools package on mingw wrongly\n    raise error ``vc6.0 is not supported``\n\n.. warning::\n\n    there is an unrelated package `aqt` in pypi. please don't confuse with it.\n\nit may be difficult to set up some windows systems with the correct version of python and all of ``aqt``'s dependencies.\nto get around this problem, ``aqtinstall`` offers ``aqt.exe``, a windows executable that contains python and all required dependencies.\nyou may access ``aqt.exe`` from the `releases section`_, under \"assets\", or via the persistent link to `the continuous build`_ of ``aqt.exe``.\n\n.. _`releases section`: https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/releases\n.. _`the continuous build`: https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/releases/download/continuous/aqt.exe\n\n\nexample\n--------\n\nwhen installing qt sdk 6.2.0 for windows.\n\ncheck the options that can be used with the ``list-qt`` subcommand, and query available architectures:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    aqt list-qt windows desktop --arch 6.2.0\n\nthen you may get candidates: ``win64_mingw81 win64_msvc2019_64 win64_msvc2019_arm64``. you can also query the available modules:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    aqt list-qt windows desktop --modules 6.2.0 win64_mingw81\n\n\nwhen you decide to install qt sdk version 6.2.0 for mingw v8.1:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.2.0 win64_mingw81 -m all\n\nthe optional `-m all` argument installs all the modules available for qt 6.2.0; you can leave it off if you don't want those modules.\n\nto install qt 6.2.0 with the modules 'qtcharts' and 'qtnetworking', you can use this command (note that the module names are lowercase):\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.2.0 win64_mingw81 -m qtcharts qtnetworking\n\nwhen you want to install qt for android with required desktop toolsets\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    aqt install-qt linux android 5.13.2 android_armv7 --autodesktop\n\n\nwhen aqtinstall downloads and installs packages, it updates package configurations\nsuch as prefix directory in ``bin/qt.conf``, and ``bin/qconfig.pri``\nto make it working well with installed directory.\n\n.. note::\n   it is your own task to set some environment variables to fit your platform, such as path, qt_plugin_path, qml_import_path, and qml2_import_path. aqtinstall will never do it for you, in order not to break the installation of multiple versions.\n\n.. warning::\n   if you are using aqtinstall to install the ios version of qt, please be aware that\n   there are compatibility issues between xcode 13+ and versions of qt less than 6.2.4.\n   you may use aqtinstall to install older versions of qt for ios, but the developers of\n   aqtinstall cannot guarantee that older versions will work on the most recent versions of macos.\n   aqtinstall is tested for ios on macos 12 with qt 6.2.4 and greater.\n   all earlier versions of qt are expected not to function.\n\ntestimonies\n-----------\n\nsome
