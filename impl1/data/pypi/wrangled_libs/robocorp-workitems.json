  "description": "# robocorp-workitems\n\nwork items are used in robocorp control room for managing data that go through\nmultiple steps and tasks inside a process. each step of a process receives input\nwork items from the previous step, and creates output work items for the next\nstep.\n\n## getting started\n\nthe library exposes two objects, `inputs` and `outputs`, which are the main way\nto interact with work item queues. the former deals with the reading input work\nitems, and the latter with creating output work items.\n\na run inside control room will always have at least one work item available to\nit. the simplest robot which reads the current work item and creates an output\ncan be done in the following manner:\n\n```python\nfrom robocorp import workitems\nfrom robocorp.tasks import task\n\n@task\ndef handle_item():\n    item = workitems.inputs.current\n    print(\"received payload:\", item.payload)\n    workitems.outputs.create(payload={\"key\": \"value\"})\n```\n\niterating over all available input items in the queue is also easy:\n\n```python\nfrom robocorp import workitems\nfrom robocorp.tasks import task\n\n@task\ndef handle_all_items():\n    for item in workitems.inputs:\n        print(\"received payload:\", item.payload)\n        workitems.outputs.create(payload={\"key\": \"value\"})\n```\n\n### work item structure\n\na work item's data payload is json and allows storing anything that is json\nserializable. by default the payload is a mapping of key-value pairs.\n\nin addition to the payload section, a work item can also contain files, which\nare stored within robocorp control room. adding and using files with work items\nrequires no additional setup from the user.\n\n## guides\n\n- [reserving and releasing input items](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/00-reserving-inputs.md)\n- [creating outputs](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/01-creating-outputs.md)\n- [local development](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/02-local-development.md)\n- [email triggering](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/03-email-triggering.md)\n- [collecting all inputs](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/04-collecting-inputs.md)\n- [flow control with exceptions](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/05-input-exceptions.md)\n- [modifying inputs](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/06-modifying-inputs.md)\n\nfurther user guides and tutorials can be found in [robocorp docs](https://robocorp.com/docs).\n\n## api reference\n\ninformation on specific functions or classes: [robocorp.workitems](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/api/robocorp.workitems.md)\n\n## changelog\n\na list of releases and corresponding changes can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/changelog.md).\n",
