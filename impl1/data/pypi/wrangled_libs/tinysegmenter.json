  "description": "tinysegmenter\n=============\n\n\u201ctinysegmenter in python\u201d is a python port_ by masato hagiwara of tinysegmenter_, which is an extremely compact japanese tokenizer originally written in javascript by mr. taku kudo.\n\nthe library has been finally packaged by jehan. it resulted into this fork because masako hagiwara did not answer emails, and packaging patches\ncould therefore not be committed upstream. but this is a friendly fork, and masako hagiwara is welcome to take back maintainance over his\nproject.\nfor the time being, i (jehan) took up the maintenance, so please refer to this new website_ as being official, and\ndirect any new patch_ there. i will follow up on patchs and bug reports, but probably won't maintain an active development. anyone wishing to\nimprove the library is welcome to participate and will be gladly given committer rights.\n\nit works on python 2.6 or above (works on python 3 too).\n\n.. _port: http://lilyx.net/tinysegmenter-in-python/\n.. _tinysegmenter: http://chasen.org/~taku/software/tinysegmenter/\n.. _website: http://tinysegmenter.tuxfamily.org/\n\nauthors\n-------\n\nsee all authors and contributors in ``authors`` file.\n\ndownload and installation\n-------------------------\n\nthis library can be installed the common ways: with a setup.py, as a pip package...\nsee the ``install`` file in the package for more details.\n\nif you simply want to download the source package, refer to the pypi repository: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tinysegmenter\n\ndevelopment version can be downloaded anonymously at the git repository::\n\n    $ git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/tinysegmente/tinysegmenter.git\n\nor browsed online at: http://git.tuxfamily.org/tinysegmente/tinysegmenter/\n\nusage\n-----\n\nexample code for direct usage::\n\n    > import tinysegmenter\n    > segmenter = tinysegmenter.tinysegmenter() \n    > print(' | '.join(segmenter.tokenize(u\"\u79c1\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306f\u4e2d\u91ce\u3067\u3059\")))\n    \u79c1 | \u306e | \u540d\u524d | \u306f | \u4e2d\u91ce | \u3067\u3059 \n\n\ntinysegmenter\u2018s interface is compatible with ``nltk``\u2019s ``tokenizeri`` class, although the distribution does not directly depend on nltk.\nhere is one way to use it as a tokenizer in nltk (order of the multiple base classes matters)::\n\n    import nltk.tokenize.api\n\n    class mytinysegmenter(tinysegmenter.tinysegmenter, nltk.tokenize.api.tokenizeri):\n        pass\n    segmenter = mytinysegmenter()\n    # this segmenter can be used any place which expects a nltk's tokenizeri subclass.\n\nfor more about nltk (*natural language toolkit* module), see: http://nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.api.tokenizeri\n\n.. _patch:\n\ncontact, bugs and contributing\n------------------------------\n\nall bug, patch, question, etc. can be sent to `tinysegmenter` at `zemarmot` dot `net`.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nthis package is distributed under a new bsd license (see ``copying`` file).",
