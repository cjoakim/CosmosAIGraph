  "description": "\n# introduction\n\nthe [python](https://www.python.org/) `class` `moarchiving.biobjectivenondominatedsortedlist` implements a bi-objective non-dominated archive with `list` as parent class. it is heavily based on the [`bisect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html) module. it provides easy and fast access to the overall hypervolume, the contributing hypervolume of each element, and to the [uncrowded hypervolume improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08823/) of any given point in objective space.\n\n## installation\n\neither simply via\n\n```\npip install moarchiving\n```\n\nor from [github](https://github.com/cma-es/moarchiving/) via\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/cma-es/moarchiving.git@master\n```\n\nthe single file [`moarchiving.py`](https://github.com/cma-es/moarchiving/moarchiving/moarchiving.py) (from the `moarchiving/` folder) can also be directly used by itself when copied in the current folder or in a path visible to python (e.g. a path contained in `sys.path`).\n\n\n\n",
