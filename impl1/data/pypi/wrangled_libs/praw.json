create a submission to r/test\n    reddit.subreddit(\"test\").submit(\"test submission\", url=\"https://reddit.com\")\n\n    # comment on a known submission\n    submission = reddit.submission(url=\"https://www.reddit.com/comments/5e1az9\")\n    submission.reply(\"super rad!\")\n\n    # reply to the first comment of a weekly top thread of a moderated community\n    submission = next(reddit.subreddit(\"mod\").top(time_filter=\"week\"))\n    submission.comments[0].reply(\"an automated reply\")\n\n    # output score for the first 256 items on the frontpage\n    for submission in reddit.front.hot(limit=256):\n        print(submission.score)\n\n    # obtain the moderator listing for r/test\n    for moderator in reddit.subreddit(\"test\").moderator():\n        print(moderator)\n\nplease see praw's `documentation <https://praw.readthedocs.io/>`_ for more examples of\nwhat you can do with praw.\n\ndiscord bots and asynchronous environments\n------------------------------------------\n\nif you plan on using praw in an asynchronous environment, (e.g., discord.py, asyncio) it\nis strongly recommended to use `async praw <https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/>`_. it is\nthe official asynchronous version of praw and its usage is similar and has the same\nfeatures as praw.\n\npraw discussion and support\n---------------------------\n\nfor those new to python, or would otherwise consider themselves a python beginner,\nplease consider asking questions on the `r/learnpython\n<https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython>`_ subreddit. there are wonderful people there who\ncan help with general python and simple praw related questions.\n\notherwise, there are a few official places to ask questions about praw:\n\n`r/redditdev <https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev>`_ is the best place on reddit to ask\npraw related questions. this subreddit is for all reddit api related discussion so\nplease tag submissions with *[praw]*. please perform a search on the subreddit first to\nsee if anyone has similar questions.\n\nreal-time chat can be conducted via the `praw slack organization\n<https://join.slack.com/t/praw/shared_invite/enqtotuwmdcxotq0nzy5lwvkmgq3zdk5ymq5mdewytzmmmjkmtjknjbknty3otu0y2e2ngrly2zhztazmwzmmwrimtmwyjdjodkxogyyzjy>`_\n(please create an issue if that invite link has expired).\n\nplease do not directly message any of the contributors via reddit, email, or slack\nunless they have indicated otherwise. we strongly encourage everyone to help others with\ntheir questions.\n\nplease file bugs and feature requests as issues on `github\n<https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/issues>`_ after first searching to ensure a similar\nissue was not already filed. if such an issue already exists please give it a thumbs up\nreaction. comments to issues containing additional information are certainly welcome.\n\n.. note::\n\n    this project is released with a `contributor code of conduct\n    <https://github.com/praw-dev/.github/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md>`_. by\n    participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\npraw's documentation is located at https://praw.readthedocs.io/.\n\nhistory\n-------\n\n`august 2010\n<https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/commit/efef08a4a713fcfd7dfddf992097cf89426586ae>`_:\ntimothy mellor created a github project called ``reddit_api``.\n\n`march 2011\n<https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/commit/ebfc9caba5b58b9e68c77af9c8e53f5562a2ee64>`_:\nthe python package ``reddit`` was registered and uploaded to pypi.\n\n`december 2011\n<https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/commit/74bb962b3eefe04ce6acad88e6f53f43d10c8803>`_:\nbryce boe took over as maintainer of the ``reddit`` package.\n\n`june 2012\n<https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/commit/adaf89fe8631f41ab9913b379de104c9ef6a1e73>`_:\nbryce renamed the project ``praw`` and the repository was relocated to the newly created\npraw-dev organization on github.\n\n`february 2016\n<https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/commit/252083ef1dbfe6ea53c2dc99ac235b4ba330b658>`_:\nbryce began work on praw4, a complete rewrite of praw.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\npraw's source (v4.0.0+) is provided under the `simplified bsd license\n<https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/blob/0860c11a9309c80621c267af7caeb6a993933744/license.txt>`_.\n\n- copyright \u00a9, 2016, bryce boe\n\nearlier versions of praw were released under `gplv3\n<https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/blob/0c88697fdc26e75f87b68e2feb11e101e90ce215/copying>`_.\n\nsponsors\n--------\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/blob/36fa3060b8938815feb45d07541877c8ce994cbb/docs/package_info/nucleilogo.png\n    :alt: nuclei\n    :target: https://nuclei.ai\n",
