let us know on [slack](http://community.getdbt.com/) in the [#db-presto-trino](https://getdbt.slack.com/channels/db-presto-trino) channel, or open [an issue](https://github.com/starburstdata/dbt-trino/issues/new)\n- want to help us build dbt-trino? check out the [contributing guide](https://github.com/starburstdata/dbt-trino/blob/head/contributing.md)\n\n### release process\nfirst 5 steps are only relevant for bumping __minor__ version:\n1. create `1.x.latest` branch from the latest tag corresponding to current minor version, e.g. `git checkout -b 1.6.latest v1.6.2` (when bumping to 1.7). push branch to remote. this branch will be used for potential backports.\n2. create new branch (do not push below commits to `1.x.latest`). add a new entry in `.changes/0.0.0.md` that points to the newly created latest branch.\n3. run `changie merge` to update `readme.md`. commit.\n4. bump version of `dbt-tests-adapter`. commit.\n5. merge these 2 commits into the master branch. add a `skip changlelog` label to the pr.\n\ncontinue with the next steps for a __minor__ version bump. start from this point for a __patch__ version bump:\n1. run `version bump` workflow. the major and minor part of the dbt version are used to associate dbt-trino's version with the dbt version.\n2. merge the bump pr. make sure that test suite pass.\n3. run `dbt-trino release` workflow to release `dbt-trino` to pypi and github.\n\n### backport process\n\nsometimes it is necessary to backport some changes to some older versions. in that case, create branch from `x.x.latest` branch. there is a `x.x.latest` for each minor version, e.g. `1.3.latest`. make a fix and open pr back to `x.x.latest`. create changelog by `changie new` as ususal, as separate changlog for each minor version is kept on every `x.x.latest` branch.\nafter merging, to make a release of that version, just follow instructions from **release process** section, but run every workflow on `x.x.latest` branch.\n\n## code of conduct\n\neveryone interacting in the dbt project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected\nto follow the [pypa code of conduct](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/).\n",
