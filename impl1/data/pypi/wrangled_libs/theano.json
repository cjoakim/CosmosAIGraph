  "description": "theano is a python library that allows you to define, optimize, and efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. it is built on top of numpy_. theano features:\n\n * **tight integration with numpy:** a similar interface to numpy's. numpy.ndarrays are also used internally in theano-compiled functions.\n * **transparent use of a gpu:** perform data-intensive computations up to 140x faster than on a cpu (support for float32 only).\n * **efficient symbolic differentiation:** theano can compute derivatives for functions of one or many inputs.\n * **speed and stability optimizations:** avoid nasty bugs when computing expressions such as log(1 + exp(x)) for large values of x.\n * **dynamic c code generation:** evaluate expressions faster.\n * **extensive unit-testing and self-verification:** includes tools for detecting and diagnosing bugs and/or potential problems.\n\ntheano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive scientific\nresearch since 2007, but it is also approachable enough to be used in the\nclassroom (ift6266 at the university of montreal).\n\n.. _numpy: http://numpy.scipy.org/\n\n\n=============\nrelease notes\n=============\n\ntheano 1.0.5 (27th of july 2020)\n================================\n\nthis is a maintenance release of theano, version ``1.0.5``, with no\nnew features, but some deprecation fixes.\n\nwe recommend that everybody update to this version.\n\nhighlights (since 1.0.4):\n\n - theano is now compatible with python 3.9\n - fixed many deprecation warnings\n\na total of 13 people contributed to this release since ``1.0.4``:\n\n - 1fish2\n - frederic bastien\n - rebecca palmer\n - miro hron\u010dok\n - dan foreman-mackey\n - adrian seyboldt\n - abergeron\n - tim gates\n - tim odonnell\n - robert p. goldman\n - duc nguyen\n - igor varfolomeev\n - thomas wiecki\n",
