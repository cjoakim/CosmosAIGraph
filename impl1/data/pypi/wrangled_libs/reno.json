  "description": "=========================================\n reno: a new way to manage release notes\n=========================================\n\nreno is a release notes manager designed with high throughput in mind,\nsupporting fast distributed development teams without introducing\nadditional development processes.  our goal is to encourage detailed\nand accurate release notes for every release.\n\nreno uses git to store its data, along side the code being\ndescribed. this means release notes can be written when the code\nchanges are fresh, so no details are forgotten. it also means that\nrelease notes can go through the same review process used for managing\ncode and other documentation changes.\n\nreno stores each release note in a separate file to enable a large\nnumber of developers to work on multiple patches simultaneously, all\ntargeting the same branch, without worrying about merge\nconflicts. this cuts down on the need to rebase or otherwise manually\nresolve conflicts, and keeps a development team moving quickly.\n\nreno also supports multiple branches, allowing release notes to be\nback-ported from master to maintenance branches together with the\ncode for bug fixes.\n\nreno organizes notes into logical groups based on whether they\ndescribe new features, bug fixes, known issues, or other topics of\ninterest to the user. contributors categorize individual notes as they\nare added, and reno combines them before publishing.\n\nnotes can be styled using restructuredtext directives, and reno's\nsphinx integration makes it easy to incorporate release notes into\nautomated documentation builds.\n\nnotes are automatically associated with the release version based on\nthe git tags applied to the repository, so it is not necessary to\ntrack changes manually using a bug tracker or other tool, or to worry\nthat an important change will be missed when the release notes are\nwritten by hand all at one time, just before a release.\n\nmodifications to notes are incorporated when the notes are shown in\ntheir original location in the history. this feature makes it possible\nto correct typos or otherwise fix a published release note after a\nrelease is made, but have the new note content associated with the\noriginal version number. notes also can be deleted, eliminating them\nfrom future documentation builds.\n\nproject meta-data\n=================\n\n.. .. image:: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/badges/reno.svg\n    :target: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/tags/index.html\n\n* free software: apache license\n* documentation: https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/\n* source: https://opendev.org/openstack/reno/\n* bugs: https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/933\n* irc: #openstack-release on oftc\n\n\n\n",
