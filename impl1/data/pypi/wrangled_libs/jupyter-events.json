  "description": "# jupyter events\n\n[![build status](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_events/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg?query=branch%3amain++)](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_events/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg?query=branch%3amain++)\n[![documentation status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jupyter-events/badge/?version=latest)](http://jupyter-events.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n_an event system for jupyter applications and extensions._\n\njupyter events enables jupyter python applications (e.g. jupyter server, jupyterlab server, jupyterhub, etc.) to emit **events**\u2014structured data describing things happening inside the application. other software (e.g. client applications like jupyterlab) can _listen_ and respond to these events.\n\n## install\n\ninstall jupyter events directly from pypi:\n\n```\npip install jupyter_events\n```\n\nor conda-forge:\n\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyter_events\n```\n\n## documentation\n\ndocumentation is available at [jupyter-events.readthedocs.io](https://jupyter-events.readthedocs.io).\n\n## about the jupyter development team\n\nthe jupyter development team is the set of all contributors to the jupyter project.\nthis includes all of the jupyter subprojects.\n\nthe core team that coordinates development on github can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\n\n## our copyright policy\n\njupyter uses a shared copyright model. each contributor maintains copyright\nover their contributions to jupyter. but, it is important to note that these\ncontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. thus, the jupyter\nsource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or\ninstitution. instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire jupyter\ndevelopment team. if individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\nchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\ntheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\nchange to one of the jupyter repositories.\n\nwith this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\nto indicate the copyright and license terms:\n\n```\n# copyright (c) jupyter development team.\n# distributed under the terms of the modified bsd license.\n```\n",
