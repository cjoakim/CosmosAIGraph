  "description": "`python-editor` is a library that provides the `editor` module for programmatically\ninterfacing with your system's $editor.\n\nexamples\n--------\n\n```python\nimport editor\ncommit_msg = editor.edit(contents=b\"# enter commit message here\")\n```\n\nopens an editor, prefilled with the contents, `# enter commit message here`.\nwhen the editor is closed, returns the contents (bytes) in variable `commit_msg`.\nnote that the argument to `contents` needs to be a bytes object on python 3.\n\n\n```python\neditor.edit(file=\"readme.txt\")\n```\n\nopens readme.txt in an editor.  changes are saved in place.  if there is\na `contents` argument then the file contents will be overwritten.\n\n```python\neditor.edit(..., use_tty=true)\n```\n\nopens the editor in a tty.  this is usually done in programs which output is\npiped to other programs.  in this case the tty is used as the editor's stdout,\nallowing interactive usage.\n\n\nhow it works\n------------\n\n`editor` first looks for the ${editor} environment variable.  if set, it uses\nthe value as-is, without fallbacks.\n\nif no $editor is set, editor will search through a list of known editors, and\nuse the first one that exists on the system.\n\nfor example, on linux, `editor` will look for the following editors in order:\n\n* vim\n* emacs\n* nano\n\nwhen calling `editor.edit`, an editor will be opened in a subprocess, inheriting\nthe parent process's stdin, stdout.\n\n\n",
