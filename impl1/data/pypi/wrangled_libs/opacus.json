status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pytorch/opacus/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/pytorch/opacus?branch=main)\n[![prs welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/prs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](contributing.md)\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-apache2-green.svg)](license)\n\n[opacus](https://opacus.ai) is a library that enables training pytorch models with differential privacy.\nit supports training with minimal code changes required on the client, has little impact on training performance, and allows the client to online track the privacy budget expended at any given moment.\n\n## target audience\nthis code release is aimed at two target audiences:\n1. ml practitioners will find this to be a gentle introduction to training a model with differential privacy as it requires minimal code changes.\n2. differential privacy researchers will find this easy to experiment and tinker with, allowing them to focus on what matters.\n\n\n## installation\nthe latest release of opacus can be installed via `pip`:\n```bash\npip install opacus\n```\nor, alternatively, via `conda`:\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge opacus\n```\n\nyou can also install directly from the source for the latest features (along with its quirks and potentially occasional bugs):\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/pytorch/opacus.git\ncd opacus\npip install -e .\n```\n\n## getting started\nto train your model with differential privacy, all you need to do is to instantiate a `privacyengine` and pass your model, data_loader, and optimizer to the engine's `make_private()` method to obtain their private counterparts.\n\n```python\n# define your components as usual\nmodel = net()\noptimizer = sgd(model.parameters(), lr=0.05)\ndata_loader = torch.utils.data.dataloader(dataset, batch_size=1024)\n\n# enter privacyengine\nprivacy_engine = privacyengine()\nmodel, optimizer, data_loader = privacy_engine.make_private(\n    module=model,\n    optimizer=optimizer,\n    data_loader=data_loader,\n    noise_multiplier=1.1,\n    max_grad_norm=1.0,\n)\n# now it's business as usual\n```\n\nthe [mnist example](https://github.com/pytorch/opacus/tree/main/examples/mnist.py) shows an end-to-end run using opacus. the [examples](https://github.com/pytorch/opacus/tree/main/examples/) folder contains more such examples.\n\n### migrating to 1.0\n\nopacus 1.0 introduced many improvements to the library, but also some breaking changes.\nif you've been using opacus 0.x and want to update to the latest release,\nplease use this [migration guide](https://github.com/pytorch/opacus/blob/main/migration_guide.md)\n\n\n## learn more\n\n### interactive tutorials\n\nwe've built a series of
