build\nextension modules. it has a simple yet powerful static configuration system in\npyproject.toml, and supports almost unlimited flexibility via cmake. it was\ninitially developed to support the demanding needs of scientific users, but can\nbuild any sort of package that uses cmake.\n\nscikit-build-core is a ground-up rewrite of the classic scikit-build. the key\nfeatures of scikit-build classic (which is setuptools based) are also present\nhere:\n\n- great support for or by most oss, compilers, ides, and libraries\n- support for c++ features and other languages like fortran\n- support for multithreaded builds\n- simple cmakefiles.txt instead of up to thousands of lines of fragile\n  setuptools/distutils code\n- cross-compile support for apple silicon and windows arm\n\nscikit-build-core was built using python packaging standards developed after\nscikit-build (classic) was written. using it directly provides the following\nfeatures over classic scikit-build:\n\n- better warnings, errors, and logging\n- no warning about unused variables\n- automatically adds ninja and/or cmake only as required\n- no dependency on setuptools, distutils, or wheel\n- powerful config system, including config options support\n- automatic inclusion of site-packages in `cmake_prefix_path`\n- findpython is backported if running on cmake < 3.26.1 (configurable), supports\n  pypy soabi & limited api / stable abi\n- limited api / stable abi and pythonless tags supported via config option\n- no slow generator search, ninja/make or msvc used by default, respects\n  `cmake_generator`\n- sdists are reproducible by default (unix, python 3.9+)\n- support for caching between builds (opt-in by setting `build-dir`)\n- support for writing out to extra wheel folders (scripts, headers, data)\n- support for selecting install components and build targets\n- dedicated entrypoints for module and prefix directories\n- several integrated dynamic metadata plugins (proposing standardized support\n  soon)\n- experimental editable mode support, with optional experimental auto rebuilds\n  on import\n- supports webassembly (emscripten/pyodide).\n\nthe following limitations are present compared to classic scikit-build:\n\n- the minimum supported cmake is 3.15\n- the minimum supported python is 3.7\n\nsome known missing features that will be developed soon:\n\n- wheels are not fully reproducible yet (nor are they in most others systems,\n  including setuptools)\n- several editable mode caveats (mentioned in the docs).\n\nother backends are also planned:\n\n- setuptools integration highly experimental\n- the extensionlib integration is missing\n- no hatchling plugin yet.\n\nthe recommended interface is the native pyproject builder. there is also a wip\nsetuptools-based interface that is being developed to provide a transition path\nfor classic scikit-build.\n\n**warning**: only the pyproject-based builder should be used; the setuptools\nbackend is experimental and likely to move to a separate package before being\ndeclared stable, and internal api is still being solidified. a future version of\nthis package will support creating new build extensions.\n\n## example\n\nto use scikit-build-core, add it to your `build-system.requires`, and specify\nthe `scikit_build_core.build` builder as your `build-system.build-backend`. you\ndo _not_ need to specify `cmake` or `ninja`; scikit-build-core will require them\nautomatically if the system versions are not sufficient.\n\n```toml\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"scikit-build-core\"]\nbuild-backend = \"scikit_build_core.build\"\n\n[project]\nname = \"scikit_build_simplest\"\nversion = \"0.0.1\"\n```\n\nyou can (and should) specify the rest of the entries in `project`, but these are\nthe minimum to get started. you can also `scikit-build-core[pyproject]` to\npre-load some dependencies if you want; in some cases this might be marginally\nfaster.\n\nan example `cmakelists.txt`:\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(version 3.15...3.27)\nproject(${skbuild_project_name} languages c)\n\nfind_package(python components interpreter development.module required)\n\npython_add_library(_module module src/module.c with_soabi)\ninstall(targets _module destination ${skbuild_project_name})\n```\n\nscikit-build-core will backport findpython from cmake 3.26.1 to older versions\nof python, and will handle pypy for you if you are building from pypy. you will\nneed to install everything you want into the full final path inside site-modules\n(so you will usually prefix everything by the package name).\n\nmore examples are in the\n[tests/packages](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core/tree/main/tests/packages).\n\n## configuration\n\nall configuration options can be placed in `pyproject.toml`, passed via\n`-c`/`--config-setting` in build or `-c`/`--config-settings` in `pip` , or set\nas environment variables. `tool.scikit-build` is used in toml, `skbuild.` for\n`-c` options, or `skbuild_*` for environment variables. the defaults are listed\nbelow:\n\n<!-- [[[cog\nfrom scikit_build_core.settings.skbuild_docs import

`cmake_args` can be\nused to set extra cmake args. `archflags` is used to specify macos universal2 or\ncross-compiles, just like setuptools.\n\nyou can also specify `[[tool.scikit-build.overrides]]` to customize values for\ndifferent systems. see the docs for details.\n\n## other projects for building\n\nscikit-build-core is a binary build backend. there are also other binary build\nbackends:\n\n- [py-build-cmake][]: a different attempt at a standards compliant builder for\n  cmake. strong focus on cross-compilation. uses flit internals.\n- [cmeel][]: a different attempt at a standards compliant builder for cmake.\n  focus on building an ecosystem around a special unimportable folder in\n  site-packages (similar to scikit-build's usage of `cmake.*` entrypoints, but\n  folder-based).\n- [meson-python][]: a meson-based build backend; has some maintainer overlap\n  with scikit-build-core.\n- [maturin][]: a build backend for rust projects, using cargo.\n- [enscons][]: a scons based backend, not very actively developed (but it\n  predates all the others in modern standard support!)\n\nif you don't need a binary build, you don't need to use a binary build backend!\nthere are some very good python build backends; we recommend [hatchling][] as a\ngood balance between good defaults for beginners and good support for advanced\nuse cases. this is the tool scikit-build-core itself uses.\n\n## acknowledgements\n\nsupport for this work was provided by nsf grant [oac-2209877][].\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n[actions-badge]:
