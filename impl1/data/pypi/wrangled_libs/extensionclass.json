  "description": "====================================================\n extensionclass and extensionclass-related packages\n====================================================\n\nextensionclass\n==============\n\nthis package provides a metaclass that allows classes implemented in\nextension modules to be subclassed in python.  unless you need\nextensionclasses for legacy applications (e.g. zope), you probably\nwant to use python's new-style classes (available since python 2.2).\n\ncomputedattribute\n=================\n\nthis package provides a way to attach attributes to an\n``extensionclass`` or instance that are computed by calling a\ncallable.  this works very much like ``property`` known from new-style\nclasses, except that a ``computedattribute`` can also be attached to\nan instance and that it honours extensionclass semantics (which is\nuseful for retaining acquisition wrappers, for example).\n\nmethodobject\n============\n\nthis package lets you attach additional \"methods\" to extensionclasses.\nthese \"methods\" are actually implemented by subclassing the\n``methodobject.method`` class and implementing the ``__call__`` method\nthere.  instances of those classes will be bound to the instances\nthey're attached to and will receive that instance object as a first\nparameter (after ``self``).\n\n\n===========\n changelog\n===========\n\n5.1 (2023-10-05)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.12.\n\n\n5.0 (2023-01-19)\n================\n\n- drop support for python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\n- fix deprecation warning in tests.\n\n\n4.9 (2022-11-17)\n================\n\n- add support for building arm64 wheels on macos.\n\n\n4.8 (2022-11-03)\n================\n\n- update python 3.11 support to the final release.\n\n\n4.7 (2022-09-16)\n================\n\n- update python 3.11 support to rc2.\n\n- disable unsafe math optimizations in c code.\n  (`#55 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/extensionclass/pull/55>`_)\n\n\n4.6 (2022-01-14)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.10 and 3.11 (as of alpha 3).\n\n\n4.5.1 (2021-06-11)\n==================\n\n- create wheels for linux (2010, 2014 and aarch) and macos.\n\n\n4.5.0 (2020-10-07)\n==================\n\n- drop support for python 3.4.\n\n- add support for python 3.8 and 3.9.\n\n- fix accessing ``__parent__`` when it is defined as a class attribute\n  that is ``none`` (e.g., in subclasses of\n  ``zope.conatiner.contained.contained``). see `issue 24\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/extensionclass/issues/24>`_.\n\n4.4.0 (2018-10-05)\n==================\n\n- fail if c extensions couldn't be compiled on compatible platforms.\n\n- add appveyor configuration to automate building windows eggs\n\n- add support for python 3.7.\n\n- fix getting attributes that are data descriptors in the python\n  implementation.\n\n- reach and automatically maintain 100% test coverage.\n\n4.3.0 (2017-02-22)\n==================\n\n- drop support for python 3.3.\n\n- remove unused c macro from ``extensionclass.h``.\n\n- fix c compilation under windows.\n\n4.2.1 (2017-02-02)\n==================\n\n- fix problems with computed attribute and property wrapping.\n\n4.2.0 (2017-01-18)\n==================\n\n- port the c extension to python 3.\n\n- add support for python 3.5 and 3.6.\n\n- drop support for python 2.6, 3.2.\n\n4.1.2 (2015-04-03)\n==================\n\n- fix calling of ``__class_init__`` hook by python implementation.\n\n4.1.1 (2015-03-20)\n==================\n\n- avoid wrapping ``__parent__`` in pure-python version.  matches\n  change made to c version in afb8488.  see issue #3.\n\n4.1 (2014-12-18)\n================\n\n- housekeeping changes only.\n\n4.1b1 (2014-11-12)\n==================\n\n- added compatibility with python 3.4.\n\n4.1a1 (2013-05-04)\n==================\n\n- added compatibility with python 3.2 and 3.3 using the python reference\n  implementation.\n\n- add python reference implementation. used by default on pypy.\n\n4.0 (2013-02-24)\n================\n\n- added trove classifiers to project metadata.\n\n4.0a1 (2011-12-13)\n==================\n\n- don't create wrappers when retrieving parent pointers.\n\n2.13.2 (2010-06-16)\n===================\n\n- lp #587760: handle tp_basicsize correctly.\n\n2.13.1 (2010-04-03)\n===================\n\n- removed undeclared testing dependency on zope.testing.\n\n- removed cruft in ``pickle/pickle.c`` related to removed ``__getnewargs__``.\n\n2.13.0 (2010-02-22)\n===================\n\n- avoid defining ``__getnewargs__`` as not to defeat the zodb persistent\n  reference optimization. refs https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/143657.\n  in order to take advantage of this optimization, you need to re-save your\n  objects.\n\n2.12.0 (2010-02-14)\n===================\n\n- removed old build artifacts and some metadata cleanup.\n\n- added support for method cache in extensionclass. patch contributed by\n  yoshinori k. okuji. see https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/486182.\n\n2.11.3 (2009-08-02)\n===================\n\n- further 64-bit fixes (python 2.4 compatibility).\n\n2.11.2 (2009-08-02)\n===================\n\n- fixed 64-bit compatibility issues for python 2.5.x / 2.6.x.  see\n  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/ for details.\n\n2.11.1 (2009-02-19)\n===================\n\n- initial egg release.\n",
