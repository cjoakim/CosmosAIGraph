  "description": "# klusta: automatic spike sorting up to 64 channels\n\n[![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/kwikteam/klusta.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kwikteam/klusta)\n[![codecov.io](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/kwikteam/klusta.svg)](http://codecov.io/github/kwikteam/klusta?branch=master)\n[![documentation status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/klusta/badge/?version=latest)](http://klusta.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\n[![pypi release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/klusta.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/klusta)\n[![github release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/kwikteam/klusta.svg)](https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta/releases/latest)\n\n[**klusta**](https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta) is an open source package for automatic spike sorting of multielectrode neurophysiological recordings made with probes containing up to a few dozens of sites.\n\nwe are also working actively on more sophisticated algorithms that will scale to hundreds/thousands of channels. this work is being done within the [phy project](https://github.com/kwikteam/phy), which is still experimental at this point.\n\n## overview\n\n**klusta** implements the following features:\n\n* **kwik**: an hdf5-based file format that stores the results of a spike sorting session.\n* **spike detection** (also known as spikedetekt): an algorithm designed for probes containing tens of channels, based on a flood-fill algorithm in the adjacency graph formed by the recording sites in the probe.\n* **automatic clustering** (also known as masked klustakwik): an automatic clustering algorithm designed for high-dimensional structured datasets.\n\n\n## gui\n\nyou will need a gui to visualize the spike sorting results.\n\nwe have developed two gui programs with the same features:\n\n* **phy kwikgui**: newer project, scales to hundreds/thousands of channels, still relatively experimental. **it will be automatically installed if you follow the install instructions below.**\n* **[klustaviewa](https://github.com/klusta-team/klustaviewa)**: widely used, but older and a bit hard to install since it relies on very old dependencies.\n\nboth guis work with the same **kwik** format.\n\n\n## quick install guide\n\nthe following instructions will install both **klusta** and the **phy kwikgui**.\n\n1. make sure that you have [**miniconda**](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) installed. you can choose the python 3.5 64-bit version for your operating system (linux, windows, or os x).\n2. [download the environment file.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwikteam/klusta/master/installer/environment.yml)\n3. open a terminal (on windows, `cmd`, not powershell) in the directory where you saved the file and type:\n\n    ```bash\n    conda env create -n klusta -f environment.yml\n    ```\n\n4. **done**! now, to use klusta and the phy kwikgui, enter the directory that contains your files and type:\n\n    ```bash\n    source activate klusta  # omit the `source` on windows\n    klusta yourfile.prm  # spikesort your data with a prm file\n    phy kwik-gui yourfile.kwik  # open the gui\n    ```\n\n    see the documentation for more details.\n\n\n### updating the software\n\nto get the latest version of the software, open a terminal and type:\n\n```\nsource activate klusta  # omit the `source` on windows\npip install klusta phy phycontrib --upgrade\n```\n\n\n## technical details\n\n**klusta** is written in pure python. the clustering code, written in python and cython, currently lives in [another repository](https://github.com/kwikteam/klustakwik2/).\n\n\n## links\n\n* [documentation](http://klusta.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (work in progress)\n* [paper in nature neuroscience (april 2016)](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4268.html)\n* [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/klustaviewas)\n* [sample data repository](http://phy.cortexlab.net/data/) (work in progress)\n\n\n## credits\n\n**klusta** is developed by [cyrille rossant](http://cyrille.rossant.net), [shabnam kadir](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=skadi56), [dan goodman](http://thesamovar.net/), [max hunter](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=mldhu99), and [kenneth harris](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=kdhar02), in the [cortexlab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab), university college london.",
