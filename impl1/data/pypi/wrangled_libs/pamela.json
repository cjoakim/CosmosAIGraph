  "description": "# pamela: yet another python wrapper for pam\n\nthere seems to be a glut of python wrappers for pam that have since been abandoned.\nthis repo merges two separate efforts:\n\n- [gnosek/python-pam](https://github.com/gnosek/python-pam)\n  - adds wrappers for a few more calls, e.g. opening sessions\n  - raises pamerror on failure instead of returning false, with informative error messages\n- [simplepam](https://github.com/leonnnn/python3-simplepam)\n  - adds python 3 support\n  - resets credentials after authentication, apparently for kerberos users\n\n## why?\n\nboth projects appear to be abandoned, with no response to issues or pull requests in at least a year, and i need it for [jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub).\n\n## use it\n\ninstall:\n\n    pip install pamela\n\ntest:\n\n    python -m pamela -a `whoami`\n",
