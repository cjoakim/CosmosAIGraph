  "description": "openedx-learning\n=============================\n\n|pypi-badge| |ci-badge| |codecov-badge| |doc-badge| |pyversions-badge|\n|license-badge|\n\nthis is experimentation/prototyping and not in any way production ready!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\noverview\n--------\n\nthe open edx learning repository holds django apps that represent core learning concepts and data models that have been extracted from edx-platform.\n\nmotivation\n----------\n\nthe short term goal of this project is to create a small, extensible core that is easier to reason about and write extensions for than edx-platform. the longer term goal is to create a more nimble core learning platform, enabling rapid experimentation and drastic changes to the learner experience that are difficult to implement with open edx today.\n\nreplacing edx-platform is explicitly *not* a goal of this project, as only a small fraction of the concepts in edx-platform make sense to carry over here. when these core concepts are extracted and the data migrated, edx-platform will import apps from this repo and make use of their public in-process apis.\n\narchitecture\n------------\n\nparts\n~~~~~\n\n* ``openedx_learning.lib`` is for shared utilities, and may include things like custom field types, plugin registration code, etc.\n* ``openedx_learning.core`` contains our core django apps, where foundational data structures and apis will live.\n* ``openedx_tagging.core`` contains the core tagging app, which provides data structures and apis for tagging open edx objects.\n\napp dependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nanything can import from ``openedx_learning.lib``.\n\ncore apps can import from each other, but cannot import from other apps outside of core. for those apps:\n\n* ``learning_publishing`` has no dependencies. all the other apps depend on it.\n* ``learning_composition`` and ``learning_navigation`` both depend on ``learning_partitioning``\n\nmodel conventions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nwe have a few different identifier types in the schema, and we try to avoid ``_id`` for this because django uses that convention to reference ids in other models/tables. so instead we have:\n\n* ``id`` is the auto-generated, internal row id and primary key. this never changes. data models should make foreign keys to this field, as per django convention.\n* ``uuid`` is a randomly generated uuid4. this is the stable way to refer to a row/resource from an external service. this never changes. this is separate from ``id`` mostly because there are performance penalties when using uuids as primary keys with mysql.\n* ``key`` is intended to be a case-sensitive, alphanumeric key, which holds some meaning to library clients. this is usually stable, but can be changed, depending on the business logic of the client. the apps in this repo should make no assumptions about it being stable. it can be used as a suffix.\n* ``num`` is like ``key``, but for use when it's strictly numeric. it can also be used as a suffix.\n\n\nsee also\n~~~~~~~~\n\nthe structure of this repo follows [oep-0049](https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architectural-decisions/oep-0049-django-app-patterns.html) where possible, and also borrows inspiration from:\n\n* [scaling django to 500 apps](https://2021.djangocon.us/talks/scaling-django-to-500-apps/) (dan palmer, djangocon us 2021)\n* [django structure for scale and longevity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg3zdxbb1oo) (radoslav georgiev, europython 2018)\n\ncode overview\n-------------\n\nthe ``openedx_learning.apps`` package contains all our django applications. all apps are named with a ``learning_`` prefix to better avoid name conflicts, because django's app namespace is flat. apps will adhere to `oep-0049: django app patterns <https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architectural-decisions/oep-0049-django-app-patterns.html>`_.\n\ndevelopment workflow\n--------------------\n\none time setup\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n.. code-block::\n\n  #
