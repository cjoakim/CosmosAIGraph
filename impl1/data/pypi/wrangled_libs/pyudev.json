  "description": "######\npyudev\n######\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/pyudev/pyudev.png?branch=develop\n   :target: http://travis-ci.org/pyudev/pyudev\n\nhttp://pyudev.readthedocs.org\n\npyudev is a lgpl_ licensed, pure python_ binding for libudev_, the device and\nhardware management and information library for linux.  it supports almost all\nlibudev_ functionality. you can enumerate devices, query device properties and\nattributes or monitor devices, including asynchronous monitoring with threads,\nor within the event loops of qt, glib or wxpython.\n\nthe binding supports cpython_ 3 and compatible versions of pypy_.\nit is tested against udev 151 or newer, earlier versions of udev\nas found on dated linux systems may work, but are not officially supported.\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nusage of pyudev is quite simply thanks to the power of the underlying udev\nlibrary. getting the labels of all partitions just takes a few lines:\n\n>>> import pyudev\n>>> context = pyudev.context()\n>>> for device in context.list_devices(subsystem='block', devtype='partition'):\n...     print(device.get('id_fs_label', 'unlabeled partition'))\n...\nboot\nswap\nsystem\n\nthe website_ provides a detailed `user guide`_ and a complete `api reference`_.\n\n\nsupport\n-------\n\nplease report issues and questions to the issue tracker, but respect the\nfollowing guidelines:\n\n- check that the issue has not already been reported.\n- check that the issue is not already fixed in the ``master`` branch.\n- open issues with clear title and a detailed description in grammatically\n  correct, complete sentences.\n- include the python version and the udev version (see ``udevadm --version``) in\n  the description of your issue.\n\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n\nthe source code is hosted on github_::\n\n   git clone git://github.com/pyudev/pyudev.git\n\nplease fork the repository and send pull requests with your fixes or new\nfeatures, but respect the following guidelines:\n\n- read `how to properly contribute to open source projects on github\n  <http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/>`_.\n- understand the `branching model\n  <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_.\n- write `good commit messages\n  <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_.\n- add unit tests if possible (refer to the `testsuite documentation\n  <http://pyudev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tests/index.html>`_).\n- add api documentation in docstrings.\n- open a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_\n  that relates to but one subject with a clear title and description in\n  grammatically correct, complete sentences.\n\n\n.. _lgpl: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html\n.. _python: http://www.python.org/\n.. _cpython: http://www.python.org/\n.. _pypy: http://www.pypy.org/\n.. _libudev: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/libudev.html\n.. _website: http://pyudev.readthedocs.org\n.. _user guide: http://pyudev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide.html\n.. _api reference: http://pyudev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/index.html\n.. _issue tracker: http://github.com/pyudev/pyudev/issues\n.. _github: http://github.com/pyudev/pyudev\n.. _git: http://www.git-scm.com/\n\n\nrequest a new release\n---------------------\ni will be doing regular releases of this project every august and october,\nshortly after fedora releases are branched from rawhide.\n\nif you believe an extra release would help you in some way, please file an\nissue, explaining why you need the new release, and i expect i'll put one up.\n\nwhy should you explain why you need the new release? well, it is helpful to me,\nbecause pyudev is not at all part of my regular work, and i tend not to know\nvery much about how it is used these days.\n",
