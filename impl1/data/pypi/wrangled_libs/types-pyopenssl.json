  "description": "## typing stubs for pyopenssl\n\nthis is a [pep 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)\ntype stub package for the [`pyopenssl`](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl) package.\nit can be used by type-checking tools like\n[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),\n[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),\n[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),\npycharm, etc. to check code that uses\n`pyopenssl`.\n\nthis version of `types-pyopenssl` aims to provide accurate annotations\nfor `pyopenssl==23.3.*`.\nthe source for this package can be found at\nhttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyopenssl. all fixes for\ntypes and metadata should be contributed there.\n\nthis stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).\nif you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.\n\n\nsee https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/readme.md for more details.\nthis package was generated from typeshed commit `f7aa7b709a826ed34f52b1de3f7095f90f349a9c` and was tested\nwith mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.332, and\npytype 2023.10.17.\n",
