  "description": "pyobjc is a bridge between python and objective-c.  it allows full\nfeatured cocoa applications to be written in pure python.  it is also\neasy to use other frameworks containing objective-c class libraries\nfrom python and to mix in objective-c, c and c++ source.\n\npython is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning\ncurve.  it combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.\n\npyobjc also supports full introspection of objective-c classes and\ndirect invocation of objective-c apis from the interactive interpreter.\n\nproject links\n-------------\n\n* `documentation <https://pyobjc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_\n\n* `issue tracker <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc/issues>`_\n\n* `repository <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc/>`_\n\n",
