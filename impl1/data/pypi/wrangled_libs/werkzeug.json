  "description": "werkzeug\n========\n\n*werkzeug* german noun: \"tool\". etymology: *werk* (\"work\"), *zeug* (\"stuff\")\n\nwerkzeug is a comprehensive `wsgi`_ web application library. it began as\na simple collection of various utilities for wsgi applications and has\nbecome one of the most advanced wsgi utility libraries.\n\nit includes:\n\n-   an interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and\n    source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any\n    frame in the stack.\n-   a full-featured request object with objects to interact with\n    headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.\n-   a response object that can wrap other wsgi applications and handle\n    streaming data.\n-   a routing system for matching urls to endpoints and generating urls\n    for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables\n    from urls.\n-   http utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user\n    agents, cookies, files, and more.\n-   a threaded wsgi server for use while developing applications\n    locally.\n-   a test client for simulating http requests during testing without\n    requiring running a server.\n\nwerkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. it is up to the developer to\nchoose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle\nrequests. it can be used to build all sorts of end user applications\nsuch as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.\n\n`flask`_ wraps werkzeug, using it to handle the details of wsgi while\nproviding more structure and patterns for defining powerful\napplications.\n\n.. _wsgi: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _flask: https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\n\n\ninstalling\n----------\n\ninstall and update using `pip`_:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    pip install -u werkzeug\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/\n\n\na simple example\n----------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from werkzeug.wrappers import request, response\n\n    @request.application\n    def application(request):\n        return response('hello, world!')\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        from werkzeug.serving import run_simple\n        run_simple('localhost', 4000, application)\n\n\ndonate\n------\n\nthe pallets organization develops and supports werkzeug and other\npopular packages. in order to grow the community of contributors and\nusers, and allow the maintainers to devote more time to the projects,\n`please donate today`_.\n\n.. _please donate today: https://palletsprojects.com/donate\n\n\nlinks\n-----\n\n-   documentation: https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/\n-   changes: https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/changes/\n-   pypi releases: https://pypi.org/project/werkzeug/\n-   source code: https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/\n-   issue tracker: https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/issues/\n-   chat: https://discord.gg/pallets\n\n",
