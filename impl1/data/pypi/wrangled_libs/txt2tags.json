  "description": "[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/jendrikseipp/txt2tags.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jendrikseipp/txt2tags)\n[![code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n\n# txt2tags\n\ntxt2tags is a document generator. it reads a text file with\nminimal markup such as `**bold**` and `//italic//` and converts it\nto the following formats:\n\n * asciidoc\n * creole 1.0\n * docbook\n * dokuwiki\n * google wiki\n * html\n * latex\n * lout\n * magicpoint\n * markdown\n * moinmoin\n * pmwiki\n * plain text\n * sgml\n * unix manpage\n * wikipedia/mediawiki\n\nyou can use it as a command line program or in a python application.\n\n# installation\n\nwe recommend using [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) to install and run txt2tags in an isolated environment without affecting any system packages:\n\n    python3 -m pip install --user pipx\n    python3 -m pipx ensurepath\n    pipx install txt2tags\n    txt2tags --help\n\nof course you can also use pip to install txt2tags globally or in a virtual environment:\n\n    pip install -u txt2tags\n\n# usage\n\nsimple example for command line usage:\n\n1. write a text file like this (leave 1st line blank):\n\n   ```\n   = hello =\n   i'm a robot. you're my **master**!\n   [smile.jpg]\n   ```\n\n2. run this command:\n\n   `txt2tags --target html --no-headers file.t2t`\n\n3. the result is:\n\n   ```\n   <h1>hello</h1>\n   <p>\n   i'm a robot. you're my <b>master</b>!\n   <img align=\"middle\" src=\"smile.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\">\n   </p>\n   ```\n\n# history\n\naurelio jargas started the development of txt2tags in 2001. the program\nsaw several releases from 2001 to 2010, the last of which was version\n2.6. afterwards, aurelio became less involved in the development. still,\nmany new features were added in the main repository\n(https://github.com/txt2tags/txt2tags), but they were never officially\nreleased. in my opinion, many of the new features are only useful for a\nvery small set of users. the extra code adds bloat to the program and\nmakes it hard to maintain the code. unfortunately, these concerns are\nnot shared by the whole txt2tags development team. therefore, i decided\nto branch off version 2.6 and maintain a simpler txt2tags version that\nworks on python 3. the file [todo.md](todo.md) lists the goals for the\nproject.\n\nif you'd like to help out with any of the tasks, please get in touch.\npull requests are very welcome!\n\n\n",
