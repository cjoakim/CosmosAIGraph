  "description": "pytest-forked: run each test in a forked subprocess\n====================================================\n\n\n.. warning::\n\n\tthis is a extraction of the xdist --forked module,\n\tfuture maintenance beyond the bare minimum is not planned until a new maintainer is found.\n\n\nthis plugin **does not work on windows** because there's no ``fork`` support.\n\n\n* ``--forked``: run each test in a forked\n  subprocess to survive ``segfaults`` or otherwise dying processes.\n\n|python| |version| |ci| |pre-commit| |black|\n\n.. |version| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pytest-forked.svg\n  :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-forked\n\n.. |ci| image:: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-forked/workflows/build/badge.svg\n  :target: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-forked/actions\n\n.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pytest-forked.svg\n  :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-forked/\n\n.. |black| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg\n  :target: https://github.com/ambv/black\n\n.. |pre-commit| image:: https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/pytest-dev/pytest-forked/master.svg\n   :target: https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/pytest-dev/pytest-forked/master\n\ninstallation\n-----------------------\n\ninstall the plugin with::\n\n    pip install pytest-forked\n\nor use the package in develope/in-place mode with\na checkout of the `pytest-forked repository`_ ::\n\n   pip install -e .\n\n\nusage examples\n---------------------\n\nif you have tests involving c or c++ libraries you might have to deal\nwith tests crashing the process.  for this case you may use the boxing\noptions::\n\n    pytest --forked\n\nwhich will run each test in a subprocess and will report if a test\ncrashed the process.  you can also combine this option with\nrunning multiple processes via pytest-xdist to speed up the test run\nand use your cpu cores::\n\n    pytest -n3 --forked\n\nthis would run 3 testing subprocesses in parallel which each\ncreate new forked subprocesses for each test.\n\n\nyou can also fork for individual tests::\n\n    @pytest.mark.forked\n    def test_with_leaky_state():\n        run_some_monkey_patches()\n\n\nthis test will be unconditionally boxed, regardless of cli flag.\n\n\n.. _`pytest-forked repository`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-forked\n",
