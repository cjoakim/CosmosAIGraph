  "description": "this package includes the snowflake connector for python, which conforms to the python db api 2.0 specification:\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/\n\nsnowflake documentation is available at:\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/\n\nsource code is also available at: https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python\n\n# release notes\n\n\n- v3.6.0(december 09,2023)\n\n  - added support for vector types\n  - changed urllib3 version pin to only affect python versions < 3.10.\n  - support for `private_key_file` and `private_key_file_pwd` connection parameters\n  - added a new flag `expired` to `snowflakeconnection` class, that keeps track of whether the connection's master token has expired.\n  - fixed a bug where date insertion failed when date format is set and qmark style binding is used.\n\n- v3.5.0(november 13,2023)\n\n  - version 3.5.0 is the snowflake-connector-python purely built upon apache arrow-nanoarrow project.\n    - reduced the wheel size to ~1mb and installation size to ~5mb.\n    - removed a hard dependency on a specific version of pyarrow.\n  - deprecated the usage of the following class/variable/environment variable for the sake of pure nanoarrow converter:\n    - deprecated class `snowflake.connector.cursor.nanoarrowusage`.\n    - deprecated environment variable `nanoarrow_usage`.\n    - deprecated module variable `snowflake.connector.cursor.nanoarrow_usage`.\n\n- v3.4.1(november 08,2023)\n\n  - bumped vendored `urllib3` to 1.26.18\n  - bumped vendored `requests` to 2.31.0\n\n- v3.4.0(november 03,2023)\n\n  - added support for `use_logical_type` in `write_pandas`.\n  - removed dependencies on pycryptodomex and oscrypto. all connections now go through openssl via the cryptography library, which was already a dependency.\n  - fixed issue with ingesting files over 80 gb to s3.\n  - added the `backoff_policy` argument to `snowflake.connector.connect` allowing for configurable backoff policy between retries of failed requests. see available implementations in the `backoff_policies` module.\n  - added the `socket_timeout` argument to `snowflake.connector.connect` specifying socket read and connect timeout.\n  - fixed `login_timeout` and `network_timeout` behaviour. retries of login and network requests are now properly halted after these timeouts expire.\n  -

fixed issue with connection diagnostics failing to complete certificate checks.\n  - fixed issue that arrow iterator causes `importerror` when the c extensions are not compiled.\n\n- v3.3.0(october 10,2023)\n\n  - updated to apache arrow-nanoarrow project for result arrow data conversion.\n  - introduced the `nanoarrow_usage` environment variable to allows switching between the nanoarrow converter and the arrow converter. valid values include:\n    - `follow_session_parameter`, which uses the converter configured in the server.\n    - `disable_nanoarrow`, which uses arrow converter, overriding the server setting.\n    - `enable_nanoarrow`, which uses the nanoarrow converter, overriding the server setting.\n  - introduced the `snowflake.connector.cursor.nanoarrowusage` enum, whose members include:\n    - `nanoarrowusage.follow_session_parameter`, which uses the converter configured in the server.\n    - `nanoarrowusage.disable_nanoarrow`, which uses arrow converter, overriding the server setting.\n    - `nanoarrowusage.enable_nanoarrow`, which uses the nanoarrow converter, overriding the server setting.\n  - introduced the `snowflake.connector.cursor.nanoarrow_usage` module variable to allow switching between the nanoarrow converter and the arrow converter. it works in conjunction with the `snowflake.connector.cursor.nanoarrowusage` enum.\n  - the newly-introduced environment variable, enum, and module variable are temporary. they will be removed in a future release when switch from arrow to nanoarrow for data conversion is complete.\n\n- v3.2.1(september 26,2023)\n\n  - fixed a bug where url port and path were ignored in private link oscp retry.\n  - added thread safety in telemetry when instantiating multiple connections concurrently.\n  - bumped platformdirs dependency from >=2.6.0,<3.9.0 to >=2.6.0,<4.0.0.0 and made necessary changes to allow this.\n  -

fixed a bug in retry logic for okta authentication to refresh token.\n  - support `rsapublickey` when constructing `authbykeypair` in addition to raw bytes.\n  - fixed a bug when connecting through socks5 proxy, the attribute `proxy_header` is missing on `socksproxymanager`.\n  - cherry-picked https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/fd2759aa16b12b33298900c77d29b3813c6582de onto vendored urllib3 (v1.26.15) to enable enforce_content_length by default.\n  - fixed a bug in tag generation of oob telemetry event.\n\n- v3.1.0(july 31,2023)\n\n  - added a feature that lets you add connection definitions to the `connections.toml` configuration file. a connection definition refers to a collection of connection parameters, for example, if you wanted to define a connection named `prod``:\n\n    ```toml\n    [prod]\n    account = \"my_account\"\n    user = \"my_user\"\n    password = \"my_password\"\n    ```\n    by default, we look for the `connections.toml` file in the location specified in the `snowflake_home` environment variable (default: `~/.snowflake`). if this folder does not exist, the python connector looks for the file in the [platformdirs](https://github.com/platformdirs/platformdirs/blob/main/readme.rst) location, as follows:\n\n    - on linux: `~/.config/snowflake/`,  but follows xdg settings\n    - on mac: `~/library/application support/snowflake/`\n    - on windows: `%userprofile%\\appdata\\local\\snowflake\\`\n\n    you can determine which file is used by running the following command:\n\n    ```\n    python -c \"from snowflake.connector.constants import connections_file; print(str(connections_file))\"\n    ```\n  -

by default the parameter is 1, meaning only a single query can be submitted at a time\n      - set to 0 to submit any number of statements in a multi-statement query\n      - set to >1 to submit the specified exact number of statements in a multi-statement query\n    - bindings are accepted in the same way for multi-statements as they are for single statement queries\n    - asynchronous multi-statement query execution is supported. users should still use `get_results_from_sfqid` to retrieve results\n    - to access the results of each query, users can call `snowflakecursor.nextset()` as specified in the db 2.0 api (pep-249), to iterate through each statements results\n      - the first statement's results are accessible immediately after calling `execute` (or `get_results_from_sfqid` if asynchronous) through the existing `fetch*()` methods\n\n- v2.8.3(november 28,2022)\n\n  -

added support for renewing the aws token used in ``put`` commands if the token expires.\n\n- v1.0.3 (jan 13, 2016)\n\n    - added support for the ``boolean`` data type (i.e. ``true`` or ``false``). this changes the behavior of the binding for the ``bool`` type object:\n\n        - previously, ``bool`` was bound as a numeric value (i.e. ``1`` for ``true``, ``0`` for ``false``).\n        - now, ``bool`` is bound as native sql data (i.e. ``true`` or ``false``).\n\n    - added the ``autocommit`` method to the ``connection`` object:\n\n        - by default, ``autocommit`` mode is on (i.e. each dml statement commits the change).\n        - if ``autocommit`` mode is off, the ``commit`` and ``rollback`` methods are enabled.\n\n    - avoid segfault issue for ``cryptography`` 1.2 in mac osx by using 1.1 until resolved.\n\n- v1.0.2 (dec 15, 2015)\n\n    - upgraded ``boto3`` 1.2.2, ``botocore`` 1.3.12.\n    - removed ``sslv3`` mapping from the initial table.\n\n- v1.0.1 (dec 8, 2015)\n\n    - minor bug fixes.\n\n- v1.0.0 (dec 1, 2015)\n\n    - general availability release.\n",
