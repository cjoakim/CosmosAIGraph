  "description": "this project hosts operations research tools developed at google and\nmade available as open source under the apache 2.0 license.\n\nor-tools includes solvers for:\n\n- constraint programming\n  - cp-sat solver: a constraint programming solver that uses sat (satisfiability)\n  methods.\n  - original cp solver: a constraint programming solver.\n- linear and mixed-integer programming\n  - glop: a linear optimizer to find the optimal value of a linear objective\n  function, given a set of linear inequalities as constraints.\n  - mpsolver, modelbuilder: wrappers around commercial and other open source\n  solvers, including mixed integer solvers: cbc, clp, glpk, gurobi or scip.\n- vehicle routing\n  a specialized library for identifying best vehicle routes given constraints.\n- graph algorithms\n  code for finding shortest paths in graphs, min-cost flows, max flows, and\n  linear sum assignments.\n",
