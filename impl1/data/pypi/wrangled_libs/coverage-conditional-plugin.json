pragma: has-django\n    import django\nexcept importerror:  # pragma: has-no-django\n    django = none\n\ndef run_if_django_is_installed():\n    if django is not none:  # pragma: has-django\n        ...\n```\n\nand here's the configuration you might use:\n\n```ini\n[coverage:coverage_conditional_plugin]\nrules =\n  \"is_installed('django')\": has-django\n  \"not is_installed('django')\": has-no-django\n\n```\n\nwhen running tests with and without `django` installed\nyou will have `100%` coverage in both cases.\n\nbut, different lines will be included.\nwith `django` installed it will include\nboth `try:` and `if django is not none:` conditions.\n\nwhen running without `django` installed,\nit will include `except importerror:` line.\n\n\n## writing pragma rules\n\nformat for pragma rules is:\n\n```\n\"pragma-condition\": pragma-name\n```\n\ncode inside `\"pragma-condition\"` is evaluted with `eval`.\nmake sure that the input you pass there is trusted!\n`\"pragma-condition\"` must return `bool` value after evaluation.\n\nwe support all environment markers specified in [pep-496](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0496/).\nsee [strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0496/#strings)\nand [version numbers](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0496/#version-numbers)\nsections for available values. also, we provide a bunch of additional markers:\n\n- `sys_version_info` is the same as [`sys.version_info`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version_info)\n- `os_environ` is the same as [`os.environ`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ)\n- `is_installed` is our custom function that tries to import the passed string, returns `bool` value\n- `package_version` is our custom function that tries to get package version from `pkg_resources` and returns its [parsed version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version/#packaging.version.parse)\n\nuse `get_env_info` to get values for the current environment:\n\n```python\nfrom coverage_conditional_plugin import get_env_info\n\nget_env_info()\n```\n\n\n## writing omits\n\nomits allow entire files to be conditionally omitted from coverage measurement.\n\nthe toml format for omits is:\n\n```toml\n[tool.coverage.coverage_conditional_plugin.omit]\n\"pragma-condition\" = [\"project/prefix*.py\", \"project/filename.py\"]\n# or\n\"pragma-condition\" = \"project/filename.py\"\n```\n\n**note**: `ini` format is not supported for `omit` configuration option,\nbecause there's no easy way to parse `ini` complex configuration. \nprs with the fix are welcome!\n\nfile name patterns should follow coverage.py's `[run] omit` syntax.\nsee [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source.html).\n\n\n## license\n\n[mit](https://github.com/wemake.services/coverage-conditional-plugin/blob/master/license)\n",
