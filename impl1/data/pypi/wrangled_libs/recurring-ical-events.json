(always present)\n* ``dtend`` which is the end of the event instance. (always present)\n* ``rdate``, ``exdate``, ``rrule`` are the rules to create event repetitions.\n  they are **not** included in repeated events, see `issue 23 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/23>`_.\n  to change this, use ``of(calendar, keep_recurrence_attributes=true)``.\n\ndifferent components, not just events\n*************************************\n\nby default the ``recurring_ical_events`` only selects events as the name already implies.\nhowever, there are different `components <https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.component>`_ available in a `calendar <https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.calendar>`_.\nyou can select which components you like to have returned by passing ``components`` to the ``of`` function:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    of(a_calendar, components=[\"vevent\"])\n\nhere is a template code for choosing the supported types of components:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   events = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar).between(...)\n   journals = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=[\"vjournal\"]).between(...)\n   todos = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=[\"vtodo\"]).between(...)\n   all = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=[\"vtodo\", \"vevent\", \"vjournal\"]).between(...)\n\nif a type of component is not listed here, it can be added.\nplease create an issue for this in the source code repository.\n\nspeed\n*****\n\nif you use ``between()`` or ``at()``\nseveral times, it is faster to re-use the object coming from ``of()``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    rcalendar = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object)\n    events_of_day_1 = rcalendar.at(day_1)\n    events_of_day_2 = rcalendar.at(day_2)\n    events_of_day_3 = rcalendar.at(day_3)\n    # ...\n\nversion fixing\n**************\n\nif you use this library in your code, you may want to make sure that\nupdates can be received but they do not break your code.\nthe version numbers are handeled this way: ``a.b.c`` example: ``0.1.12``\n\n- ``c`` is changed for each minor bug fix.\n- ``b`` is changed whenever new features are added.\n- ``a`` is changed when the interface or major assumptions change that may break your code.\n\nso, i recommend to version-fix this library to stay with the same ``a``\nwhile ``b`` and ``c`` can change.\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n\nto run the tests, we use ``tox``.\n``tox`` tests all different python versions which we want to  be compatible to.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   pip3 install tox\n\nto run all the tests:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   tox\n\nto run the tests in a specific python version:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   tox -e py39\n\ntesting\n*******\n\nthis project's development is driven by tests.\ntests assure a consistent interface and less knowledge lost over time.\nif you like to change the code, tests help that nothing breaks in the future.\nthey are required in that sense.\nexample code and ics files can be transferred into tests and speed up fixing bugs.\n\nyou can view the tests in the `test folder\n<https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/tree/master/test>`_.\nif you have a calendar ics file for which this library does not\ngenerate the desired output, you can add it to the ``test/calendars``\nfolder and write tests for what you expect.\nif you like, `open an issue <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues>`_ first, e.g. to discuss the changes and\nhow to go about it.\n\nnew releases\n------------\n\nto release new versions,\n\n1. edit the changelog section\n2. edit setup.py, the ``__version__`` variable\n3. create a commit and push it\n4. wait for `github actions <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/actions>`_ to finish the build\n5. run\n\n   .. code-block:: shell\n\n       python3 setup.py tag_and_deploy\n\n6. notify the issues about their release\n\nchangelog\n---------\n\n- v2.1.2\n\n  - fix rrule with exdate as date, see `pr 121 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/pull/121>`__ by jan grasnick and `pr 122 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/pull/122>`__.\n\n- v2.1.1\n\n  -

remove ``beta`` indicator. this library works okay: feature requests come in, not so much bug reports.\n\n- v1.1.0b\n\n  - add repeated todos and journals. see `pull request 100 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/pull/100>`_ and `issue 97 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/97>`_.\n\n- v1.0.3b\n\n  - remove syntax anomalies in readme.\n  - switch to github actions because gitlab decided to remove support.\n\n- v1.0.2b\n\n  - add support for ``x-wr-timezone`` calendars which contain events without an explicit time zone, see `issue 86 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/86>`_.\n\n- v1.0.1b\n\n  - add support for ``zoneinfo.zoneinfo`` time zones, see `issue 57 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/57>`_.\n  - migrate from travis ci to gitlab ci.\n  - add code coverage on gitlab.\n\n- v1.0.0b\n\n  - remove python 2 support, see `issue 64 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/64>`_.\n  - remove support for python 3.5 and 3.6.\n  - note: these deprecated python versions may still work. we just do not claim they do.\n  -

``between()`` and ``at()`` take the same kind of arguments. these arguments are documented.\n\n- v0.2.3b\n\n  - ``between()`` and ``at()`` allow arguments with time zones now when calendar events do not have time zones, reported in `issue 61 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/61>`_ and `issue 52 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/52>`_.\n\n- v0.2.2b\n\n  -

fix issue with repetitions over dst boundary. see `issue 48 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/48>`_.\n\n- v0.1.20b\n\n  - fix handling of modified recurrences with lower sequence number than their base event `pull request 45 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/pull/45>`_\n\n- v0.1.19b\n\n  - benchmark using `@mrx23dot <https://github.com/mrx23dot>`_'s script and speed up recurrence calculation by factor 4, see `issue 42 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/42>`_.\n\n- v0.1.18b\n\n  - handle `issue 28 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/28>`__ so that exdates match as expected.\n  - handle `issue 27 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/27>`_ so that parsing some rrule until values does not crash.\n\n- v0.1.17b\n\n  - handle `issue 28 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/28>`__ where passed arguments lead to errors where it is expected to work.\n\n- v0.1.16b\n\n  - events with an empty rrule are handled like events without an rrule.\n  - remove fixed dependency versions, see `issue 14 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/14>`_\n\n- v0.1.15b\n\n  - repeated events also include subcomponents. `issue 6 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/6>`_\n\n- v0.1.14b\n\n  - fix compatibility `issue 20 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/20>`_: exdates of different time zones are now supported.\n\n- v0.1.13b\n\n  - remove attributes rdate, exdate, rrule from repeated events `issue 23`_\n  - use vdddtypes instead of explicit date/datetime type `pull request 19 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/pull/19>`_\n  - start changelog\n\nlibraries used\n--------------\n\n- `python-dateutil <https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/>`_ -
