wheels are great. building them across **mac, linux, windows**, on **multiple versions of python**, is not.\n\n`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your ci server - currently it supports github actions, azure pipelines, travis ci, appveyor, circleci, and gitlab ci - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.\n\n\nwhat does it do?\n----------------\n\n|

examples](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/working-examples) page in the docs.\n\nlegal note\n----------\n\nsince `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.\n\nit helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.\n\nthis is similar to static linking, so it might have some license implications. check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.\n\nchangelog\n=========\n\n<!-- start

3.12 version to 3.12.0, final release (#1635)\n- \u2728 adds a debug option [`cibw_debug_keep_container`](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#cibw_debug_keep_container) to stop cibuildwheel deleting build containers after the build finishes. (#1620)\n- \ud83d\udcda adds support for `[tool.cibuildwheel]` checking by adding a schema compatible with the [validate-pyproject](https://github.com/abravalheri/validate-pyproject/) tool (#1622, #1628, #1629)\n- \ud83d\udc1b fix parsing of `cibw_container_engine` and `cibw_build_frontend` options to not break arguments on `:` characters (#1621)\n- \ud83d\udc1b fix the evaluation order of `cibw_environment` and `cibw_environment_pass` so that `cibw_environment` assignments can reference environment variables passed through from the host machine. (#1617)\n- \ud83d\udee0 supports manylinux images' deferred installation of interpreters through the `manylinux-interpreters` tool (#1630)\n\n### v2.16.1\n\n_26 september 2023_\n\n- \ud83d\udee0 updates the prerelease cpython 3.12 version to 3.12.0rc3 (#1625)\n- \ud83d\udee0 only calls `linux32` in containers when necessary (#1599)\n\n### v2.16.0\n\n_18 september 2023_\n\n- \u2728 add the ability to pass additional flags to a build frontend through the [cibw_build_frontend](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#build-frontend) option (#1588).\n- \u2728 the environment variable source_date_epoch is now automatically passed through to container linux builds (useful for [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/)!) (#1589)\n- \ud83d\udee0 updates the prerelease cpython 3.12 version to 3.12.0rc2 (#1604)\n- \ud83d\udc1b fix `requires_python` auto-detection from setup.py when the call to `setup()` is within an `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block (#1613)\n- \ud83d\udc1b fix a bug that prevented building linux wheels in docker on a windows host (#1573)\n- \ud83d\udc1b `--only` can now select prerelease-pythons (#1564)\n- \ud83d\udcda docs & examples updates (#1582, #1593, #1598, #1615)\n\n### v2.15.0\n\n_8 august 2023_\n\n- \ud83c\udf1f cpython 3.12 wheels are now built by default - without the cibw_prerelease_pythons flag. it's time to build and upload these wheels to pypi! this release includes cpython 3.12.0rc1, which is guaranteed to be abi compatible with the final release. (#1565)\n- \u2728 adds musllinux_1_2 support - this allows packagers to build for musl-based linux distributions on a more recent alpine image, and a newer musl libc. (#1561)\n\n### v2.14.1\n\n_15 july 2023_\n\n- \ud83d\udee0 updates the prerelease cpython 3.12 version to 3.12.0b4 (#1550)\n\n<!-- end bin/update_readme_changelog.py -->\n\n---\n\nthat's the last few versions.\n\n\u2139\ufe0f **want more changelog? head over to [the changelog page in the docs](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog/).**\n\n---\n\ncontributing\n============\n\nfor more info on how to contribute to cibuildwheel, see the [docs](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/).\n\neveryone interacting with the cibuildwheel project via codebase, issue tracker, chat rooms, or otherwise is expected to follow the [psf code of conduct](https://github.com/pypa/.github/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md).\n\nmaintainers\n-----------\n\n- joe rickerby [@joerick](https://github.com/joerick)\n- yannick jadoul [@yannickjadoul](https://github.com/yannickjadoul)\n- matthieu darbois [@mayeut](https://github.com/mayeut)\n- henry schreiner [@henryiii](https://github.com/henryiii)\n- grzegorz bokota [@czaki](https://github.com/czaki)\n\ncredits\n-------\n\n`cibuildwheel` stands on the shoulders of giants.\n\n- \u2b50\ufe0f @matthew-brett for [multibuild](https://github.com/multi-build/multibuild) and [matthew-brett/delocate](http://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)\n- @pypa for the manylinux docker images [pypa/manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux)\n- @ogrisel for [wheelhouse-uploader](https://github.com/ogrisel/wheelhouse-uploader) and `run_with_env.cmd`\n\nmassive props also to-\n\n- @zfrenchee for [help debugging many issues](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/issues/2)\n- @lelit for some great bug reports and [contributions](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/73)\n- @mayeut for a [phenomenal pr](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/71) patching python itself for better compatibility!\n- @czaki for being a super-contributor over many prs and helping out with countless issues!\n- @mattip for his help with adding pypy support to cibuildwheel\n\nsee also\n========\n\nanother very similar tool to consider is [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a shell script toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. it is used as a basis to build some of the big data science tools, like scipy.\n\nif you are building rust wheels, you can get by without some of the tricks required to make glibc work via manylinux; this is especially relevant for cross-compiling, which is easy with rust. see [maturin-action](https://github.com/messense/maturin-action) for a tool that is optimized for building rust wheels and cross-compiling.\n",
