  "description": "|badge1| |badge2|\n\n.. |badge1| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/pypa/distlib/package-tests.yml\n   :alt: github workflow status (with event)\n\n.. |badge2| image:: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/pypa/distlib\n   :target: https://app.codecov.io/gh/pypa/distlib\n   :alt: github coverage status\n\nwhat is it?\n-----------\n\ndistlib is a library which implements low-level functions that relate to\npackaging and distribution of python software. it is intended to be used as the\nbasis for third-party packaging tools. the documentation is available at\n\nhttps://distlib.readthedocs.io/\n\nmain features\n-------------\n\ndistlib currently offers the following features:\n\n* the package ``distlib.database``, which implements a database of installed\n  distributions, as defined by :pep:`376`, and distribution dependency graph\n  logic. support is also provided for non-installed distributions (i.e.\n  distributions registered with metadata on an index like pypi), including\n  the ability to scan for dependencies and building dependency graphs.\n* the package ``distlib.index``, which implements an interface to perform\n  operations on an index, such as registering a project, uploading a\n  distribution or uploading documentation. support is included for verifying\n  ssl connections (with domain matching) and signing/verifying packages using\n  gnupg.\n* the package ``distlib.metadata``, which implements distribution metadata as\n  defined by :pep:`643`, :pep:`566`, :pep:`345`, :pep:`314` and :pep:`241`.\n* the package ``distlib.markers``, which implements environment markers as\n  defined by :pep:`508`.\n* the package ``distlib.manifest``, which implements lists of files used\n  in packaging source distributions.\n* the package ``distlib.locators``, which allows finding distributions, whether\n  on pypi (xml-rpc or via the \"simple\" interface), local directories or some\n  other source.\n* the package ``distlib.resources``, which allows access to data files stored\n  in python packages, both in the file system and in .zip files.\n* the package ``distlib.scripts``, which allows installing of scripts with\n  adjustment of shebang lines and support for native windows executable\n  launchers.\n* the package ``distlib.version``, which implements version specifiers as\n  defined by :pep:`440`, but also support for working with \"legacy\" versions and\n  semantic versions.\n* the package ``distlib.wheel``, which provides support for building and\n  installing from the wheel format for binary distributions (see :pep:`427`).\n* the package ``distlib.util``, which contains miscellaneous functions and\n  classes which are useful in packaging, but which do not fit neatly into\n  one of the other packages in ``distlib``.* the package implements enhanced\n  globbing functionality such as the ability to use ``**`` in patterns to\n  specify recursing into subdirectories.\n\n\npython version and platform compatibility\n-----------------------------------------\n\ndistlib is intended to be used on and is tested on python versions 2.7 and 3.6 or later,\npypy-2.7 and pypy3 on linux, windows, and macos.\n\nproject status\n--------------\n\nthe project has reached a mature status in its development: there is a comprehensive\ntest suite and it has been exercised on windows, ubuntu and macos. the project is used\nby well-known projects such as `pip <https://pypi.org/pypi/pip>`_ and `caniusepython3\n<https://pypi.org/pypi/caniusepython3>`_.\n\nthis project was migrated from mercurial to git and from bitbucket to github, and\nalthough all information of importance has been retained across the migration, some\ncommit references in issues and issue comments may have become invalid.\n\ncode of conduct\n---------------\n\neveryone interacting in the distlib project's codebases, issue trackers, chat\nrooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the `pypa code of conduct`_.\n\n.. _pypa code of conduct: https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/\n\n\n",
