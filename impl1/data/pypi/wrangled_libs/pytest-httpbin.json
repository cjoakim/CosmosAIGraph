  "description": "pytest-httpbin\n==============\n\nhttpbin is an amazing web service for testing http libraries. it has several\ngreat endpoints that can test pretty much everything you need in a http\nlibrary. the only problem is: maybe you don't want to wait for your tests to\ntravel across the internet and back to make assertions against a remote web\nservice.\n\nenter pytest-httpbin. pytest-httpbin creates a pytest \"fixture\" that is\ndependency-injected into your tests. it automatically starts up a http server\nin a separate thread running httpbin and provides your test with the url in the\nfixture. check out this example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def test_that_my_library_works_kinda_ok(httpbin):\n        assert requests.get(httpbin.url + '/get/').status_code == 200\n\nthis replaces a test that might have looked like this before:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def test_that_my_library_works_kinda_ok():\n        assert requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get').status_code == 200\n\npytest-httpbin also supports https and includes its own ca cert you can use.\ncheck out `the full documentation`_ on the github page.\n\n.. _the full documentation: https://github.com/kevin1024/pytest-httpbin\n",
