[**yt-dlc@f9401f2**](https://github.com/blackjack4494/yt-dlc/commit/f9401f2a91987068139c5f757b12fc711d4c0cee) and merged with [**youtube-dl@66ab08**](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/commit/66ab0814c4baa2dc79c2dd5287bc0ad61a37c5b9) ([exceptions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/21))\n\n* **[sponsorblock integration](#sponsorblock-options)**: you can mark/remove sponsor sections in youtube videos by utilizing the [sponsorblock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) api\n\n* **[format sorting](#sorting-formats)**: the default format sorting options have been changed so that higher resolution and better codecs will be now preferred instead of simply using larger bitrate. furthermore, you can now specify the sort order using `-s`. this allows for much easier format selection than what is possible by simply using `--format` ([examples](#format-selection-examples))\n\n* **merged with animelover1984/youtube-dl**: you get most of the features and improvements from [animelover1984/youtube-dl](https://github.com/animelover1984/youtube-dl) including `--write-comments`, `bilibilisearch`, `bilibilichannel`, embedding thumbnail in mp4/ogg/opus, playlist infojson etc. note that niconico livestreams are not available. see [#31](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/31) for details.\n\n* **youtube improvements**:\n    * supports clips, stories (`ytstories:<channel ucid>`), search (including filters)**\\***, youtube music search, channel-specific search, search prefixes (`ytsearch:`, `ytsearchdate:`)**\\***, mixes, and feeds (`:ytfav`, `:ytwatchlater`, `:ytsubs`, `:ythistory`, `:ytrec`, `:ytnotif`)\n    * fix for [n-sig based throttling](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29326) **\\***\n    * supports some (but not all) age-gated content without cookies\n    * download livestreams from the start using `--live-from-start` (*experimental*)\n    * channel urls download all uploads of the channel, including shorts and live\n\n* **cookies from browser**: cookies can be automatically extracted from all major web browsers using `--cookies-from-browser browser[+keyring][:profile][::container]`\n\n* **download time range**: videos can be downloaded partially based on either timestamps or chapters using `--download-sections`\n\n* **split video by chapters**: videos can be split into multiple files based on chapters using `--split-chapters`\n\n* **multi-threaded fragment downloads**: download multiple fragments of m3u8/mpd videos in parallel. use `--concurrent-fragments` (`-n`) option to set the number of threads used\n\n* **aria2c with hls/dash**: you can use `aria2c` as the external downloader for dash(mpd) and hls(m3u8) formats\n\n* **new and fixed extractors**: many new extractors have been added and a lot of existing ones have been fixed. see the [changelog](changelog.md) or the [list of supported sites](supportedsites.md)\n\n* **new msos**: philo, spectrum, slingtv, cablevision, rcn etc.\n\n* **subtitle extraction from manifests**: subtitles can be extracted from streaming media manifests. see [commit/be6202f](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/be6202f12b97858b9d716e608394b51065d0419f) for details\n\n* **multiple paths and output templates**: you can give different [output templates](#output-template) and download paths for different types of files. you can also set a temporary path where intermediary files are downloaded to using `--paths` (`-p`)\n\n* **portable configuration**: configuration files are automatically loaded from the home and root directories. see [configuration](#configuration) for details\n\n* **output template improvements**: output templates can now have date-time formatting, numeric offsets, object traversal etc. see [output template](#output-template) for details. even more advanced operations can also be done with the help of `--parse-metadata` and `--replace-in-metadata`\n\n* **other new options**: many new options have been added such as `--alias`, `--print`, `--concat-playlist`, `--wait-for-video`, `--retry-sleep`, `--sleep-requests`, `--convert-thumbnails`, `--force-download-archive`, `--force-overwrites`, `--break-match-filter` etc\n\n* **improvements**: regex and other operators in `--format`/`--match-filter`, multiple `--postprocessor-args` and `--downloader-args`, faster archive checking, more [format selection options](#format-selection), merge multi-video/audio, multiple `--config-locations`, `--exec` at different stages, etc\n\n* **plugins**: extractors and postprocessors can be loaded from an external file. see [plugins](#plugins) for details\n\n* **self updater**: the releases can be updated using `yt-dlp -u`, and downgraded using `--update-to` if required\n\n* **automated builds**: [nightly/master builds](#update-channels) can be used with `--update-to nightly` and `--update-to master`\n\nsee [changelog](changelog.md) or [commits](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commits) for the full list of changes\n\nfeatures marked with a **\\*** have been back-ported to youtube-dl\n\n### differences in default behavior\n\nsome of yt-dlp's default options are different from that of youtube-dl and youtube-dlc:\n\n* yt-dlp supports only [python 3.7+](## \"windows 7\"), and *may* remove support for more versions as they [become eol](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#python-release-cycle); while [youtube-dl still supports python 2.6+ and 3.2+](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30568#issue-1118238743)\n* the options `--auto-number` (`-a`), `--title` (`-t`) and `--literal` (`-l`), no longer work. see [removed options](#removed) for details\n* `avconv` is not supported as an alternative to `ffmpeg`\n* yt-dlp stores config files in slightly different locations to youtube-dl. see [configuration](#configuration) for a list of correct locations\n* the default [output template](#output-template) is `%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`. there is no real reason for this change. this was changed before yt-dlp was ever made public and now there are no plans to change it back to `%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s`. instead, you may use `--compat-options filename`\n* the default [format sorting](#sorting-formats) is different from youtube-dl and prefers higher resolution and better codecs rather than higher bitrates. you can use the `--format-sort` option to change this to any order you prefer, or use `--compat-options format-sort` to use youtube-dl's sorting order\n* the default format selector is `bv*+ba/b`. this means that if a combined video + audio format that is better than the best video-only format is found, the former will be preferred. use `-f bv+ba/b` or `--compat-options format-spec` to revert this\n* unlike youtube-dlc, yt-dlp does not allow merging multiple audio/video streams into one file by default (since this conflicts with the use of `-f bv*+ba`). if needed, this feature must be enabled using `--audio-multistreams` and `--video-multistreams`. you can also use `--compat-options multistreams` to enable both\n* `--no-abort-on-error` is enabled by default. use `--abort-on-error` or `--compat-options abort-on-error` to abort on errors instead\n* when writing metadata files such as thumbnails, description or infojson, the same information (if available) is also written for playlists. use `--no-write-playlist-metafiles` or `--compat-options no-playlist-metafiles` to not write these files\n* `--add-metadata` attaches the `infojson` to `mkv` files in addition to writing the metadata when used with `--write-info-json`. use `--no-embed-info-json` or `--compat-options no-attach-info-json` to revert this\n* some metadata are embedded into different fields when using `--add-metadata` as compared to youtube-dl. most notably, `comment` field contains the `webpage_url` and `synopsis` contains the `description`. you can [use `--parse-metadata`](#modifying-metadata) to modify this to your liking or use `--compat-options embed-metadata` to revert this\n* `playlist_index` behaves differently when used with options like `--playlist-reverse` and `--playlist-items`. see [#302](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/302) for details. you can use `--compat-options playlist-index` if you want to keep the earlier behavior\n* the output of `-f` is listed in a new format. use `--compat-options list-formats` to revert this\n* live chats (if available) are considered as subtitles. use `--sub-langs all,-live_chat` to download all subtitles except live chat. you can also use `--compat-options no-live-chat` to prevent any live chat/danmaku from downloading\n* youtube channel urls download all uploads of the channel. to download only the videos in a specific tab, pass the tab's url. if the channel does not show the requested tab, an error will be raised. also, `/live` urls raise an error if there are no live videos instead of silently downloading the entire channel. you may use `--compat-options no-youtube-channel-redirect` to revert all these redirections\n* unavailable videos are also listed for youtube playlists. use `--compat-options no-youtube-unavailable-videos` to remove this\n* the upload dates extracted from youtube are in utc [when available](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/89e4d86171c7b7c997c77d4714542e0383bf0db0/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#l3898-l3900). use `--compat-options no-youtube-prefer-utc-upload-date` to prefer the non-utc upload date.\n* if `ffmpeg` is used as the downloader, the downloading and merging of formats happen in a single step when possible. use `--compat-options no-direct-merge` to revert this\n* thumbnail embedding in `mp4` is done with mutagen if possible. use `--compat-options embed-thumbnail-atomicparsley` to force the use of atomicparsley instead\n* some internal metadata such as filenames are removed by default from the infojson. use `--no-clean-infojson` or `--compat-options no-clean-infojson` to revert this\n* when `--embed-subs` and `--write-subs` are used together, the subtitles are written to disk and also embedded in the media file. you can use just `--embed-subs` to embed the subs and automatically delete the separate file. see [#630 (comment)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/630#issuecomment-893659460) for more info. `--compat-options no-keep-subs` can be used to revert this\n* `certifi` will be used for ssl root certificates, if installed. if you want to use system certificates (e.g. self-signed), use `--compat-options no-certifi`\n* yt-dlp's sanitization of invalid characters in filenames is different/smarter than in youtube-dl. you can use `--compat-options filename-sanitization` to revert to youtube-dl's behavior\n* yt-dlp tries to parse the external downloader outputs into the standard progress output if possible (currently implemented: [~~aria2c~~](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/5931)). you can use `--compat-options no-external-downloader-progress` to get the downloader output as-is\n* yt-dlp versions between 2021.09.01 and 2023.01.02 applies `--match-filter` to nested playlists. this was an unintentional side-effect of [8f18ac](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/8f18aca8717bb0dd49054555af8d386e5eda3a88) and is fixed in [d7b460](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/d7b460d0e5fc710950582baed2e3fc616ed98a80). use `--compat-options playlist-match-filter` to revert this\n* yt-dlp versions between 2021.11.10 and 2023.06.21 estimated `filesize_approx` values for fragmented/manifest formats. this was added for convenience in [f2fe69](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/f2fe69c7b0d208bdb1f6292b4ae92bc1e1a7444a), but was reverted in [0dff8e](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/0dff8e4d1e6e9fb938f4256ea9af7d81f42fd54f) due to the potentially extreme inaccuracy of the estimated values. use `--compat-options manifest-filesize-approx` to keep extracting the estimated values\n* yt-dlp uses modern http client backends such as `requests`. use `--compat-options prefer-legacy-http-handler` to prefer the legacy http handler (`urllib`) to be used for standard http requests.\n\nfor ease of use, a few more compat options are available:\n\n* `--compat-options all`: use all compat options (do not use)\n* `--compat-options youtube-dl`: same as `--compat-options all,-multistreams,-playlist-match-filter,-manifest-filesize-approx`\n* `--compat-options youtube-dlc`: same as `--compat-options all,-no-live-chat,-no-youtube-channel-redirect,-playlist-match-filter,-manifest-filesize-approx`\n* `--compat-options 2021`: same as `--compat-options 2022,no-certifi,filename-sanitization,no-youtube-prefer-utc-upload-date`\n* `--compat-options 2022`: same as `--compat-options playlist-match-filter,no-external-downloader-progress,prefer-legacy-http-handler,manifest-filesize-approx`. use this to enable all future compat options\n\n\n# installation\n\n<!-- manpage: begin

versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/-all_versions-lightgrey.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases)\n<!-- manpage: end excluded section -->\n\nyou can install yt-dlp using [the binaries](#release-files), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp) or one using a third-party package manager. see [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/installation) for detailed instructions\n\n\n## update\nyou can use `yt-dlp -u` to update if you are using the [release binaries](#release-files)\n\nif you [installed with pip](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/installation#with-pip), simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program\n\nfor other third-party package managers, see [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/installation#third-party-package-managers) or refer their documentation\n\n<a id=\"update-channels\"/>\n\nthere are currently three release channels for binaries: `stable`, `nightly` and `master`.\n\n* `stable` is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the `nightly` and `master` channels.\n* the `nightly` channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight utc, for a snapshot of the project's new patches and changes. this is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. the `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases) or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` pypi package (which can be installed with pip's `--pre` flag).\n* the `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. they are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds/releases).\n\nwhen using `--update`/`-u`, a release binary will only update to its current channel.\n`--update-to channel` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [channel@]tag` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.\n\nyou may also use `--update-to <repository>` (`<owner>/<repository>`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.\n\nexample usage:\n* `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release\n* `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06`\n* `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel\n* `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24`\n\n**important**: any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report:\n```\n# to update to nightly from stable executable/binary:\nyt-dlp --update-to nightly\n\n# to install nightly with pip:\npython -m pip install -u --pre yt-dlp\n```\n\n<!-- manpage: begin excluded section -->\n## release files\n\n####

respective licensing terms.\n\nthe standalone release binaries are built with the python interpreter and the packages marked with **\\*** included.\n\nif you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. all the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the `--verbose` output\n\n\n## compile\n\n### standalone pyinstaller builds\nto build the standalone executable, you must have python and `pyinstaller` (plus any of yt-dlp's [optional dependencies](#dependencies) if needed). once you have all the necessary dependencies installed, simply run `pyinst.py`. the executable will be built for the same architecture (x86/arm, 32/64 bit) as the python used.\n\n    python3 -m pip install -u pyinstaller -r requirements.txt\n    python3 devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py\n    python3 pyinst.py\n\non some systems, you may need to use `py` or `python` instead of `python3`.\n\n`pyinst.py` accepts any arguments that can be passed to `pyinstaller`, such as `--onefile/-f` or `--onedir/-d`, which is further [documented here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate).\n\n**note**: pyinstaller versions below 4.4 [do not support](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms) python installed from the windows store without using a virtual environment.\n\n**important**: running `pyinstaller` directly **without** using `pyinst.py` is **not** officially supported. this may or may not work correctly.\n\n### platform-independent binary (unix)\nyou will need the build tools `python` (3.7+), `zip`, `make` (gnu), `pandoc`\\* and `pytest`\\*.\n\nafter installing these, simply run `make`.\n\nyou can also run `make yt-dlp` instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (the build tools marked with **\\*** are not needed for this)\n\n### standalone py2exe builds (windows)\n\nwhile we provide the option to build with [py2exe](https://www.py2exe.org), it is recommended to build [using pyinstaller](#standalone-pyinstaller-builds) instead since the py2exe builds **cannot contain `pycryptodomex`/`certifi` and needs vc++14** on the target computer to run.\n\nif you wish to build it anyway, install python and py2exe, and then simply run `setup.py py2exe`\n\n    py -m pip install -u py2exe -r requirements.txt\n    py devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py\n    py setup.py py2exe\n\n### related scripts\n\n* **`devscripts/update-version.py`** - update the version number based on current date.\n* **`devscripts/set-variant.py`** - set the build variant of the executable.\n* **`devscripts/make_changelog.py`** - create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update `contributors` file.\n* **`devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py`** - create lazy extractors. running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance. set the environment variable `ytdlp_no_lazy_extractors=1` if you wish to forcefully disable lazy extractor loading.\n\nnote: see their `--help` for more info.\n\n### forking the project\nif you fork the project on github, you can run your fork's [build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) to automatically build the selected version(s) as artifacts. alternatively, you can run the [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) or enable the [nightly workflow](.github/workflows/release-nightly.yml) to create full (pre-)releases.\n\n# usage and options\n\n<!-- manpage: begin excluded section -->\n    yt-dlp [options] [--] url [url...]\n\n`ctrl+f` is your friend :d\n<!-- manpage: end excluded section -->\n\n<!-- auto generated -->\n## general options:\n    -h, --help                      print this help text and exit\n    --version                       print program version and exit\n    -u, --update                    update this program to the latest version\n    --no-update                     do not check for updates (default)\n    --update-to [channel]@[tag]     upgrade/downgrade to a specific version.\n                                    channel can be a repository as well. channel\n                                    and tag default to \"stable\" and \"latest\"\n                                    respectively if omitted; see \"update\" for\n                                    details. supported channels: stable,\n                                    nightly, master\n    -i, --ignore-errors             ignore download and postprocessing errors.\n                                    the download will be considered successful\n                                    even if the postprocessing fails\n    --no-abort-on-error             continue with next video on download errors;\n                                    e.g. to skip unavailable videos in a\n                                    playlist (default)\n    --abort-on-error                abort downloading of further videos if an\n                                    error occurs (alias: --no-ignore-errors)\n    --dump-user-agent               display the current user-agent and exit\n    --list-extractors               list all supported extractors and exit\n    --extractor-descriptions        output descriptions of all supported\n                                    extractors and exit\n    --use-extractors names          extractor names to use separated by commas.\n                                    you can also use regexes, \"all\", \"default\"\n                                    and \"end\" (end url matching); e.g. --ies\n                                    \"holodex.*,end,youtube\". prefix the name\n                                    with a \"-\" to exclude it, e.g. --ies\n                                    default,-generic. use --list-extractors for\n                                    a list of extractor names.

          can use this option multiple times to give\n                                    arguments for different extractors\n\n# configuration\n\nyou can configure yt-dlp by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file. the configuration is loaded from the following locations:\n\n1. **main configuration**:\n    * the file given by `--config-location`\n1. **portable configuration**: (recommended for portable installations)\n    * if using a binary, `yt-dlp.conf` in the same directory as the binary\n    * if running from source-code, `yt-dlp.conf` in the parent directory of `yt_dlp`\n1. **home configuration**:\n    * `yt-dlp.conf` in the home path given by `-p`\n    * if `-p` is not given, the current directory is searched\n1. **user configuration**:\n    * `${xdg_config_home}/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `${xdg_config_home}/yt-dlp/config` (recommended on linux/macos)\n    * `${xdg_config_home}/yt-dlp/config.txt`\n    * `${appdata}/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `${appdata}/yt-dlp/config` (recommended on windows)\n    * `${appdata}/yt-dlp/config.txt`\n    * `~/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `~/yt-dlp.conf.txt`\n    * `~/.yt-dlp/config`\n    * `~/.yt-dlp/config.txt`\n\n    see also: [notes about environment variables](#notes-about-environment-variables)\n1. **system configuration**:\n    * `/etc/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `/etc/yt-dlp/config`\n    * `/etc/yt-dlp/config.txt`\n\ne.g. with the following configuration file yt-dlp will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under `youtube` directory in your home directory:\n```\n# lines starting with # are comments\n\n# always extract audio\n-x\n\n# do not copy the mtime\n--no-mtime\n\n# use this proxy\n--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128\n\n# save all videos under youtube directory in your home directory\n-o ~/youtube/%(title)s.%(ext)s\n```\n\n**note**: options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls; thus there **must be no whitespace** after `-` or `--`, e.g. `-o` or `--proxy` but not `- o` or `-- proxy`. they must also be quoted when necessary as-if it were a unix shell.\n\nyou can use `--ignore-config` if you want to disable all configuration files for a particular yt-dlp run. if `--ignore-config` is found inside any configuration file, no further configuration will be loaded. for example, having the option in the portable configuration file prevents loading of home, user, and system configurations. additionally, (for backward compatibility) if `--ignore-config` is found inside the system configuration file, the user configuration is not loaded.\n\n### configuration file encoding\n\nthe configuration files are decoded according to the utf bom if present, and in the encoding from system locale otherwise.\n\nif you want your file to be decoded differently, add `# coding: encoding` to the beginning of the file (e.g. `# coding: shift-jis`). there must be no characters before that, even spaces or bom.\n\n### authentication with netrc\n\nyou may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with `--username` and `--password`) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every yt-dlp execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. you can achieve this using a [`.netrc` file](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info) on a per-extractor basis. for that you will need to create a `.netrc` file in `--netrc-location` and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:\n```\ntouch ${home}/.netrc\nchmod a-rwx,u+rw ${home}/.netrc\n```\nafter that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where *extractor* is the name of the extractor in lowercase:\n```\nmachine <extractor> login <username> password <password>\n```\ne.g.\n```\nmachine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password\nmachine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password\n```\nto activate authentication with the `.netrc` file you should pass `--netrc` to yt-dlp or place it in the [configuration file](#configuration).\n\nthe default location of the .netrc file is `~` (see below).\n\nas an alternative to using the `.netrc` file, which has the disadvantage of keeping your passwords in a plain text file, you can configure a custom shell command to provide the credentials for an extractor. this is done by providing the `--netrc-cmd` parameter, it shall output the credentials in the netrc format and return `0` on success, other values will be treated as an error. `{}` in the command will be replaced by the name of the extractor to make it possible to select the credentials for the right extractor.\n\ne.g. to use an encrypted `.netrc` file stored as `.authinfo.gpg`\n```\nyt-dlp --netrc-cmd 'gpg --decrypt ~/.authinfo.gpg' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baw_jenozkc\n```\n\n\n### notes about environment variables\n* environment variables are normally specified as `${variable}`/`$variable` on unix and `%variable%` on windows; but is always shown as `${variable}` in this documentation\n* yt-dlp also allow using unix-style variables on windows for path-like options; e.g. `--output`, `--config-location`\n* if unset, `${xdg_config_home}` defaults to `~/.config` and `${xdg_cache_home}` to `~/.cache`\n* on windows, `~` points to `${home}` if present; or, `${userprofile}` or `${homedrive}${homepath}` otherwise\n* on windows, `${userprofile}` generally points to `c:\\users\\<user name>` and `${appdata}` to `${userprofile}\\appdata\\roaming`\n\n# output template\n\nthe `-o` option is used to indicate a template for the output file names while `-p` option is used to specify the path each type of file should be saved to.\n\n<!-- manpage: begin excluded section -->\n**tl;dr:** [navigate me to examples](#output-template-examples).\n<!-- manpage: end excluded section -->\n\nthe simplest usage of `-o` is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file, like in `yt-dlp -o funny_video.flv \"https://some/video\"` (hard-coding file extension like this is _not_ recommended and could break some post-processing).\n\nit may however also contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each video. the special sequences may be formatted according to [python string formatting operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting), e.g. `%(name)s` or `%(name)05d`. to clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses, followed by formatting operations.\n\nthe field names themselves (the part inside the parenthesis) can also have some special formatting:\n\n1. **object traversal**: the dictionaries and lists available in metadata can be traversed by using a dot `.` separator; e.g. `%(tags.0)s`, `%(subtitles.en.-1.ext)s`. you can do python slicing with colon `:`; e.g. `%(id.3:7:-1)s`, `%(formats.:.format_id)s`. curly braces `{}` can be used to build dictionaries with only specific keys; e.g. `%(formats.:.{format_id,height})#j`. an empty field name `%()s` refers to the entire infodict; e.g. `%(.{id,title})s`. note that all the fields that become available using this method are not listed below. use `-j` to see such fields\n\n1. **addition**: addition and subtraction of numeric fields can be done using `+` and `-` respectively. e.g. `%(playlist_index+10)03d`, `%(n_entries+1-playlist_index)d`\n\n1. **date/time formatting**: date/time fields can be formatted according to [strftime formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes) by specifying it separated from the field name using a `>`. e.g. `%(duration>%h-%m-%s)s`, `%(upload_date>%y-%m-%d)s`, `%(epoch-3600>%h-%m-%s)s`\n\n1. **alternatives**: alternate fields can be specified separated with a `,`. e.g. `%(release_date>%y,upload_date>%y|unknown)s`\n\n1. **replacement**: a replacement value can be specified using a `&` separator according to the [`str.format` mini-language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language). if the field is *not* empty, this replacement value will be used instead of the actual field content. this is done after alternate fields are considered; thus the replacement is used if *any* of the alternative fields is *not* empty. e.g. `%(chapters&has chapters|no chapters)s`, `%(title&title={:>20}|no title)s`\n\n1. **default**: a literal default value can be specified for when the field is empty using a `|` separator. this overrides `--output-na-placeholder`. e.g. `%(uploader|unknown)s`\n\n1. **more conversions**: in addition to the normal format types `diouxxeeffggcrs`, yt-dlp additionally supports converting to `b` = **b**ytes, `j` = **j**son (flag `#` for pretty-printing, `+` for unicode), `h` = html escaping, `l` = a comma separated **l**ist (flag `#` for `\\n` newline-separated), `q` = a string **q**uoted for the terminal (flag `#` to split a list into different arguments), `d` = add **d**ecimal suffixes (e.g. 10m) (flag `#` to use 1024 as factor), and `s` = **s**anitize as filename (flag `#` for restricted)\n\n1. **unicode normalization**: the format type `u` can be used for nfc [unicode normalization](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize). the alternate form flag (`#`) changes the normalization to nfd and the conversion flag `+` can be used for nfkc/nfkd compatibility equivalence normalization. e.g. `%(title)+.100u` is nfkc\n\nto summarize, the general syntax for a field is:\n```\n%(name[.keys][addition][>strf][,alternate][&replacement][|default])[flags][width][.precision][length]type\n```\n\nadditionally, you can set different output templates for the various metadata files separately from the general output template by specifying the type of file followed by the template separated by a colon `:`. the different file types supported are `subtitle`, `thumbnail`, `description`, `annotation` (deprecated), `infojson`, `link`, `pl_thumbnail`, `pl_description`, `pl_infojson`, `chapter`, `pl_video`. e.g. `-o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" -o \"thumbnail:%(title)s\\%(title)s.%(ext)s\"`  will put the thumbnails in a folder with the same name as the video. if any of the templates is empty, that type of file will not be written. e.g. `--write-thumbnail -o \"thumbnail:\"` will write thumbnails only for playlists and not for video.\n\n<a id=\"outtmpl-postprocess-note\"/>\n\n**note**: due to post-processing (i.e. merging etc.), the actual output filename might differ. use `--print after_move:filepath` to get the name after all post-processing is complete.\n\nthe available fields are:\n\n - `id` (string): video identifier\n -

sequence name. e.g. for `-o %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s` and an mp4 video with title `yt-dlp test video` and id `baw_jenozkc`, this will result in a `yt-dlp test video-baw_jenozkc.mp4` file created in the current directory.\n\n**note**: some of the sequences are not guaranteed to be present since they depend on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor. such sequences will be replaced with placeholder value provided with `--output-na-placeholder` (`na` by default).\n\n**tip**: look at the `-j` output to identify which fields are available for the particular url\n\nfor numeric sequences you can use [numeric related formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting); e.g. `%(view_count)05d` will result in a string with view count padded with zeros up to 5 characters, like in `00042`.\n\noutput templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g. `-o \"%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s\"` which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding to this path template. any missing directory will be automatically created for you.\n\nto use percent literals in an output template use `%%`. to output to stdout use `-o -`.\n\nthe current default template is `%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`.\n\nin some cases, you don't want special characters such as \u4e2d, spaces, or &, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a windows system or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel. in these cases, add the `--restrict-filenames` flag to get a shorter title.\n\n#### output

tries to download the best available quality if you **don't** pass any options.\nthis is generally equivalent to using `-f bestvideo*+bestaudio/best`. however, if multiple audiostreams is enabled (`--audio-multistreams`), the default format changes to `-f bestvideo+bestaudio/best`. similarly, if ffmpeg is unavailable, or if you use yt-dlp to stream to `stdout` (`-o -`), the default becomes `-f best/bestvideo+bestaudio`.\n\n**deprecation warning**: latest versions of yt-dlp can stream multiple formats to the stdout simultaneously using ffmpeg. so, in future versions, the default for this will be set to `-f bv*+ba/b` similar to normal downloads. if you want to preserve the `-f b/bv+ba` setting, it is recommended to explicitly specify it in the configuration options.\n\nthe general syntax for format selection is `-f format` (or `--format format`) where `format` is a *selector expression*, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.\n\n<!-- manpage: begin excluded section -->\n**tl;dr:** [navigate me to examples](#format-selection-examples).\n<!-- manpage: end excluded section -->\n\nthe simplest case is requesting a specific format; e.g. with `-f 22` you can download the format with format code equal to 22. you can get the list of available format codes for particular video using `--list-formats` or `-f`. note that these format codes are extractor specific.\n\nyou can also use a file extension (currently `3gp`, `aac`, `flv`, `m4a`, `mp3`, `mp4`, `ogg`, `wav`, `webm` are supported) to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g. `-f webm` will download the best quality format with the `webm` extension served as a single file.\n\nyou can use `-f -` to interactively provide the format selector *for each video*\n\nyou can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:\n\n - `all`: select **all formats** separately\n - `mergeall`: select and **merge all formats** (must be used with `--audio-multistreams`, `--video-multistreams` or both)\n - `b*`, `best*`: select the best quality format that **contains either** a video or an audio or both (ie; `vcodec!=none or acodec!=none`)\n - `b`, `best`: select the best quality format that **contains both** video and audio. equivalent to `best*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]`\n - `bv`, `bestvideo`: select the best quality **video-only** format. equivalent to `best*[acodec=none]`\n - `bv*`, `bestvideo*`: select the best quality format that **contains video**. it may also contain audio. equivalent to `best*[vcodec!=none]`\n - `ba`, `bestaudio`: select the best quality **audio-only** format. equivalent to `best*[vcodec=none]`\n - `ba*`, `bestaudio*`: select the best quality format that **contains audio**. it may also contain video. equivalent to `best*[acodec!=none]` ([do not use!](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/979#issuecomment-919629354))\n - `w*`, `worst*`: select the worst quality format that contains either a video or an audio\n - `w`, `worst`: select the worst quality format that contains both video and audio. equivalent to `worst*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]`\n - `wv`, `worstvideo`: select the worst quality video-only format. equivalent to `worst*[acodec=none]`\n - `wv*`, `worstvideo*`: select the worst quality format that contains video. it may also contain audio. equivalent to `worst*[vcodec!=none]`\n - `wa`, `worstaudio`: select the worst quality audio-only format. equivalent to `worst*[vcodec=none]`\n - `wa*`, `worstaudio*`: select the worst quality format that contains audio. it may also contain video. equivalent to `worst*[acodec!=none]`\n\nfor example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use `-f worstvideo`. it is however recommended not to use `worst` and related options. when your format selector is `worst`, the format which is worst in all respects is selected. most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. so it is generally better to use `-s +size` or more rigorously, `-s +size,+br,+res,+fps` instead of `-f worst`. see [sorting formats](#sorting-formats) for more details.\n\nyou can select the n'th best format of a type by using `best<type>.<n>`. for example, `best.2` will select the 2nd best combined format. similarly, `bv*.3` will select the 3rd best format that contains a video stream.\n\nif you want to download multiple videos, and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. note that formats on the left hand side are preferred; e.g. `-f 22/17/18` will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.\n\nif you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator, e.g. `-f 22,17,18` will download all these three formats, of course if they are available. or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature: `-f 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio`.\n\nyou can merge the video and audio of multiple formats into a single file using `-f <format1>+<format2>+...` (requires ffmpeg installed); e.g. `-f bestvideo+bestaudio` will download the best video-only format, the best audio-only format and mux them together with ffmpeg.\n\n**deprecation warning**: since the *below* described behavior is complex and counter-intuitive, this will be removed and multistreams will be enabled by default in the future. a new operator will be instead added to limit formats to single audio/video\n\nunless `--video-multistreams` is used, all formats with a video stream except the first one are ignored. similarly, unless `--audio-multistreams` is used, all formats with an audio stream except the first one are ignored. e.g. `-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --video-multistreams --audio-multistreams` will download and merge all 3 given formats. the resulting file will have 2 video streams and 2 audio streams. but `-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --no-video-multistreams` will download and merge only `bestvideo` and `bestaudio`. `best` is ignored since another format containing a video stream (`bestvideo`) has already been selected. the order of the formats is therefore important. `-f best+bestaudio --no-audio-multistreams` will download only `best` while `-f bestaudio+best --no-audio-multistreams` will ignore `best` and download only `bestaudio`.\n\n## filtering formats\n\nyou can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in `-f \"best[height=720]\"` (or `-f \"[filesize>10m]\"` since filters without a selector are interpreted as `best`).\n\nthe following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=` (equals), `!=` (not equals):\n\n - `filesize`: the number of bytes, if known in advance\n - `filesize_approx`: an estimate for the number of bytes\n - `width`: width of the video, if known\n - `height`: height of the video, if known\n - `aspect_ratio`: aspect ratio of the video, if known\n - `tbr`: average bitrate of audio and video in kbit/s\n - `abr`: average audio bitrate in kbit/s\n - `vbr`: average video bitrate in kbit/s\n - `asr`: audio sampling rate in hertz\n - `fps`: frame rate\n - `audio_channels`: the number of audio channels\n - `stretched_ratio`: `width:height` of the video's pixels, if not square\n\nalso filtering work for comparisons `=` (equals), `^=` (starts with), `$=` (ends with), `*=` (contains), `~=` (matches regex) and following string meta fields:\n\n - `url`: video url\n - `ext`: file extension\n - `acodec`: name of the audio codec in use\n - `vcodec`: name of the video codec in use\n - `container`: name of the container format\n - `protocol`: the protocol that will be used for the actual download, lower-case (`http`, `https`, `rtsp`, `rtmp`, `rtmpe`, `mms`, `f4m`, `ism`, `http_dash_segments`, `m3u8`, or `m3u8_native`)\n - `language`: language code\n - `dynamic_range`: the dynamic range of the video\n - `format_id`: a short description of the format\n - `format`: a human-readable description of the format\n - `format_note`: additional info about the format\n - `resolution`: textual description of width and height\n\nany string comparison may be prefixed with negation `!` in order to produce an opposite comparison, e.g. `!*=` (does not contain). the comparand of a string comparison needs to be quoted with either double or single quotes if it contains spaces or special characters other than `._-`.\n\n**note**: none of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by particular extractor, i.e. the metadata offered by the website. any other field made available by the extractor can also be used for filtering.\n\nformats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (`?`) after the operator. you can combine format filters, so `-f \"bv[height<=?720][tbr>500]\"` selects up to 720p videos (or videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 kbit/s. you can also use the filters with `all` to download all formats that satisfy the filter, e.g. `-f \"all[vcodec=none]\"` selects all audio-only formats.\n\nformat selectors can also be grouped using parentheses; e.g. `-f \"(mp4,webm)[height<480]\"` will download the best pre-merged mp4 and webm formats with a height lower than 480.\n\n## sorting formats\n\nyou can change the criteria for being considered the `best` by using `-s` (`--format-sort`). the general format for this is `--format-sort field1,field2...`.\n\nthe available fields are:\n\n - `hasvid`: gives priority to formats that have a video stream\n - `hasaud`: gives priority to formats that have an audio stream\n - `ie_pref`: the format preference\n - `lang`: the language preference\n - `quality`: the quality of the format\n - `source`: the preference of the source\n - `proto`: protocol used for download (`https`/`ftps` > `http`/`ftp` > `m3u8_native`/`m3u8` > `http_dash_segments`> `websocket_frag` > `mms`/`rtsp` > `f4f`/`f4m`)\n - `vcodec`: video codec (`av01` > `vp9.2` > `vp9` > `h265` > `h264` > `vp8` > `h263` > `theora` > other)\n - `acodec`: audio codec (`flac`/`alac` > `wav`/`aiff` > `opus` > `vorbis` > `aac` > `mp4a` > `mp3` > `ac4` > `eac3` > `ac3` > `dts` > other)\n - `codec`: equivalent to `vcodec,acodec`\n - `vext`: video extension (`mp4` > `mov` > `webm` > `flv` > other). if `--prefer-free-formats` is used, `webm` is preferred.\n - `aext`: audio extension (`m4a` > `aac` > `mp3` > `ogg` > `opus` > `webm` > other). if `--prefer-free-formats` is used, the order changes to `ogg` > `opus` > `webm` > `mp3` > `m4a` > `aac`\n - `ext`: equivalent to `vext,aext`\n - `filesize`: exact filesize, if known in advance\n - `fs_approx`: approximate filesize\n - `size`: exact filesize if available, otherwise approximate filesize\n - `height`: height of video\n - `width`: width of video\n - `res`: video resolution, calculated as the smallest dimension.\n - `fps`: framerate of video\n - `hdr`: the dynamic range of the video (`dv` > `hdr12` > `hdr10+` > `hdr10` > `hlg` > `sdr`)\n - `channels`: the number of audio channels\n - `tbr`: total average bitrate in kbit/s\n - `vbr`: average video bitrate in kbit/s\n - `abr`: average audio bitrate in kbit/s\n - `br`: average bitrate in kbit/s, `tbr`/`vbr`/`abr`\n - `asr`: audio sample rate in hz\n \n**deprecation warning**: many of these fields have (currently undocumented) aliases, that may be removed in a future version. it is recommended to use only the documented field names.\n\nall fields, unless specified otherwise, are sorted in descending order. to reverse this, prefix the field with a `+`. e.g. `+res` prefers format with the smallest resolution. additionally, you can suffix a preferred value for the fields, separated by a `:`. e.g. `res:720` prefers larger videos, but no larger than 720p and the smallest video if there are no videos less than 720p. for `codec` and `ext`, you can provide two preferred values, the first for video and the second for audio. e.g. `+codec:avc:m4a` (equivalent to `+vcodec:avc,+acodec:m4a`) sets the video codec preference to `h264` > `h265` > `vp9` > `vp9.2` > `av01` > `vp8` > `h263` > `theora` and audio codec preference to `mp4a` > `aac` > `vorbis` > `opus` > `mp3` > `ac3` > `dts`. you can also make the sorting prefer the nearest values to the provided by using `~` as the delimiter. e.g. `filesize~1g` prefers the format with filesize closest to 1 gib.\n\nthe fields `hasvid` and `ie_pref` are always given highest priority in sorting, irrespective of the user-defined order. this behaviour can be changed by using `--format-sort-force`. apart from these, the default order used is: `lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,vcodec:vp9.2,channels,acodec,size,br,asr,proto,ext,hasaud,source,id`. the extractors may override this default order, but they cannot override the user-provided order.\n\nnote that the default has `vcodec:vp9.2`; i.e. `av1` is not preferred. similarly, the default for hdr is `hdr:12`; i.e. dolby vision is not preferred. these choices are made since dv and av1 formats are not yet fully compatible with most devices. this may be changed in the future as more devices become capable of smoothly playing back these formats.\n\nif your format selector is `worst`, the last item is selected after sorting. this means it will select the format that is worst in all respects. most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. so it is generally better to use `-f best -s +size,+br,+res,+fps`.\n\n**tip**: you can use the `-v -f` to see how the formats have been sorted (worst to best).\n\n## format selection

`--parse-metadata` and `--replace-in-metadata`\n\n`--replace-in-metadata fields regex replace` is used to replace text in any metadata field using [python regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax). [backreferences](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=backreferences#re.sub) can be used in the replace string for advanced use.\n\nthe general syntax of `--parse-metadata from:to` is to give the name of a field or an [output template](#output-template) to extract data from, and the format to interpret it as, separated by a colon `:`. either a [python regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax) with named capture groups, a single field name, or a similar syntax to the [output template](#output-template) (only `%(field)s` formatting is supported) can be used for `to`. the option can be used multiple times to parse and modify various fields.\n\nnote that these options preserve their relative order, allowing replacements to be made in parsed fields and viceversa. also, any field thus created can be used in the [output template](#output-template) and will also affect the media file's metadata added when using `--embed-metadata`.\n\nthis option also has a few special uses:\n\n* you can download an additional url based on the metadata of the currently downloaded video. to do this, set the field `additional_urls` to the url that you want to download. e.g. `--parse-metadata \"description:(?p<additional_urls>https?://www\\.vimeo\\.com/\\d+)\"` will download the first vimeo video found in the description\n\n* you can use this to change the metadata that is embedded in the media file. to do this, set the value of the corresponding field with a `meta_` prefix. for example, any value you set to `meta_description` field will be added to the `description` field in the file - you can use this to set a different \"description\" and \"synopsis\". to modify the metadata of individual streams, use the `meta<n>_` prefix (e.g. `meta1_language`). any value set to the `meta_` field will overwrite all default values.\n\n**note**: metadata modification happens before format selection, post-extraction and other post-processing operations. some fields may be added or changed during these steps, overriding your changes.\n\nfor reference, these are the fields yt-dlp adds by default to the file metadata:\n\nmetadata fields            | from\n:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------\n`title`                    | `track` or `title`\n`date`

title as \"artist - title\"\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"title:%(artist)s - %(title)s\"\n\n# regex example\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"description:artist - (?p<artist>.+)\"\n\n# set title as \"series name s01e05\"\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"%(series)s s%(season_number)02de%(episode_number)02d:%(title)s\"\n\n# prioritize uploader as the \"artist\" field in video metadata\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"%(uploader|)s:%(meta_artist)s\" --embed-metadata\n\n# set \"comment\" field in video metadata using description instead of webpage_url,\n# handling multiple lines correctly\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"description:(?s)(?p<meta_comment>.+)\" --embed-metadata\n\n# do not set any \"synopsis\" in the video metadata\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \":(?p<meta_synopsis>)\"\n\n# remove \"formats\" field from the infojson by setting it to an empty string\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"video::(?p<formats>)\" --write-info-json\n\n# replace all spaces and \"_\" in title and uploader with a `-`\n$ yt-dlp --replace-in-metadata \"title,uploader\" \"[ _]\" \"-\"\n\n```\n\n# extractor arguments\n\nsome extractors accept additional arguments which can be passed using `--extractor-args key:args`. `args` is a `;` (semicolon) separated string of `arg=val1,val2`. e.g. `--extractor-args \"youtube:player-client=android_embedded,web;include_live_dash\" --extractor-args \"funimation:version=uncut\"`\n\nnote: in cli, `arg` can use `-` instead of `_`; e.g. `youtube:player-client\"` becomes `youtube:player_client\"`\n\nthe following extractors use this feature:\n\n#### youtube\n* `lang`: prefer translated metadata (`title`, `description` etc) of this language code (case-sensitive). by default, the video primary language metadata is preferred, with a fallback to `en` translated. see [youtube.py](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c26f9b991a0681fd3ea548d535919cec1fbbd430/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#l381-l390) for list of supported content language codes\n* `skip`: one or more of `hls`, `dash` or `translated_subs` to skip extraction of the m3u8 manifests, dash manifests and [auto-translated subtitles](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/4090#issuecomment-1158102032) respectively\n* `player_client`: clients to extract video data from. the main clients are `web`, `android` and `ios` with variants `_music`, `_embedded`, `_embedscreen`, `_creator` (e.g. `web_embedded`); and `mweb`, `mweb_embedscreen` and `tv_embedded` (agegate bypass) with no variants. by default, `ios,android,web` is used, but `tv_embedded` and `creator` variants are added as required for age-gated videos. similarly, the music variants are added for `music.youtube.com` urls. you can use `all` to use all the clients, and `default` for the default clients.\n* `player_skip`: skip some network requests that are generally needed for robust extraction. one or more of `configs` (skip client configs), `webpage` (skip initial webpage), `js` (skip js player). while these options can help reduce the number of requests needed or avoid some rate-limiting, they could cause some issues. see [#860](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/860) for more details\n* `player_params`: youtube player parameters to use for player requests. will overwrite any default ones set by yt-dlp.\n* `comment_sort`: `top` or `new` (default) - choose comment sorting mode (on youtube's side)\n* `max_comments`: limit the amount of comments to gather. comma-separated list of integers representing `max-comments,max-parents,max-replies,max-replies-per-thread`. default is `all,all,all,all`\n    * e.g. `all,all,1000,10` will get a maximum of 1000 replies total, with up to 10 replies per thread. `1000,all,100` will get a maximum of 1000 comments, with a maximum of 100 replies total\n* `formats`: change the types of formats to return. `dashy` (convert http to dash), `duplicate` (identical content but different urls or protocol; includes `dashy`), `incomplete` (cannot be downloaded completely - live dash and post-live m3u8)\n* `innertube_host`: innertube api host to use for all api requests; e.g. `studio.youtube.com`, `youtubei.googleapis.com`. note that cookies exported from one subdomain will not work on others\n* `innertube_key`: innertube api key to use for all api requests\n* `raise_incomplete_data`: `incomplete data received` raises an error instead of reporting a warning\n\n#### youtubetab (youtube playlists, channels, feeds, etc.)\n* `skip`: one or more of `webpage` (skip initial webpage download), `authcheck` (allow the download of playlists requiring authentication when no initial webpage is downloaded. this may cause unwanted behavior, see [#1122](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/1122) for more details)\n* `approximate_date`: extract approximate `upload_date` and `timestamp` in flat-playlist. this may cause date-based filters to be slightly off\n\n#### generic\n* `fragment_query`: passthrough any query in mpd/m3u8 manifest urls to their fragments if no value is provided, or else apply the query string given as `fragment_query=value`. does not apply to ffmpeg\n* `variant_query`: passthrough the master m3u8 url query to its variant playlist urls if no value is provided, or else apply the query string given as `variant_query=value`\n* `hls_key`: an hls aes-128 key uri *or* key (as hex), and optionally the iv (as hex), in the form of `(uri|key)[,iv]`; e.g. `generic:hls_key=abcdef1234567980,0xfedcba0987654321`. passing any of these values will force usage of the native hls downloader and override the corresponding values found in the m3u8 playlist\n* `is_live`: bypass live hls detection and manually set `live_status` - a value of `false` will set `not_live`, any other value (or no value) will set `is_live`\n\n#### funimation\n* `language`: audio languages to extract, e.g. `funimation:language=english,japanese`\n* `version`: the video version to extract - `uncut` or `simulcast`\n\n#### crunchyrollbeta (crunchyroll)\n* `format`: which stream type(s) to extract (default: `adaptive_hls`). potentially useful values include `adaptive_hls`, `adaptive_dash`, `vo_adaptive_hls`, `vo_adaptive_dash`, `download_hls`, `download_dash`, `multitrack_adaptive_hls_v2`\n* `hardsub`: preference order for which hardsub versions to extract, or `all` (default: `none` = no hardsubs), e.g. `crunchyrollbeta:hardsub=en-us,none`\n\n#### vikichannel\n* `video_types`: types of videos to download - one or more of `episodes`, `movies`, `clips`, `trailers`\n\n#### niconico\n* `segment_duration`: segment duration in milliseconds for hls-dmc formats. use it at your own risk since this feature **may result in your account termination.**\n\n#### youtubewebarchive\n* `check_all`: try to check more at the cost of more requests. one or more of `thumbnails`, `captures`\n\n#### gamejolt\n* `comment_sort`: `hot` (default), `you` (cookies needed), `top`, `new` - choose comment sorting mode (on gamejolt's side)\n\n#### hotstar\n* `res`: resolution to ignore - one or more of `sd`, `hd`, `fhd`\n* `vcodec`: vcodec to ignore - one or more of `h264`, `h265`, `dvh265`\n* `dr`: dynamic range to ignore - one or more of `sdr`, `hdr10`, `dv`\n\n#### niconicochannelplus\n* `max_comments`: maximum number of comments to extract - default is `120`\n\n#### tiktok\n* `api_hostname`: hostname to use for mobile api requests, e.g. `api-h2.tiktokv.com`\n* `app_version`: app version to call mobile apis with - should be set along with `manifest_app_version`, e.g. `20.2.1`\n* `manifest_app_version`: numeric app version to call mobile apis with, e.g. `221`\n\n#### rokfinchannel\n* `tab`: which tab to download - one of `new`, `top`, `videos`, `podcasts`, `streams`, `stacks`\n\n#### twitter\n* `api`: select one of `graphql` (default), `legacy` or `syndication` as the api for tweet extraction. has no effect if logged in\n\n#### stacommu, wrestleuniverse\n* `device_id`: uuid value assigned by the website and used to enforce device limits for paid livestream content. can be found in browser local storage\n\n#### twitch\n* `client_id`: client id value to be sent with graphql requests, e.g. `twitch:client_id=kimne78kx3ncx6brgo4mv6wki5h1ko`\n\n#### nhkradirulive (nhk \u3089\u3058\u308b\u2605\u3089\u3058\u308b live)\n* `area`: which regional variation to extract. valid areas are: `sapporo`, `sendai`, `tokyo`, `nagoya`, `osaka`, `hiroshima`, `matsuyama`, `fukuoka`. defaults to `tokyo`\n\n#### nflplusreplay\n* `type`: type(s) of game replays to extract. valid types are: `full_game`, `full_game_spanish`, `condensed_game` and `all_22`. you can use `all` to extract all available replay types, which is the default\n\n**note**: these options may be changed/removed in the future without concern for backward compatibility\n\n<!-- manpage: move \"installation\" section here -->\n\n\n# plugins\n\nnote that **all** plugins are imported even if not invoked, and that **there are no checks** performed on plugin code. **use plugins at your own risk and only if you trust the code!**\n\nplugins can be of `<type>`s `extractor` or `postprocessor`. \n- extractor plugins do not need to be enabled from the cli and are automatically invoked when the input url is suitable for it. \n- extractor plugins take priority over builtin extractors.\n- postprocessor plugins can be invoked using `--use-postprocessor name`.\n\n\nplugins are loaded from the namespace packages `yt_dlp_plugins.extractor` and `yt_dlp_plugins.postprocessor`.\n\nin other words, the file structure on the disk looks something like:\n    \n        yt_dlp_plugins/\n            extractor/\n                myplugin.py\n            postprocessor/\n                myplugin.py\n\nyt-dlp looks for these `yt_dlp_plugins` namespace folders in many locations (see below) and loads in plugins from **all** of them.\n\nsee the [wiki for some known plugins](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/plugins)\n\n## installing plugins\n\nplugins can be installed using various methods and locations.\n\n1. **configuration directories**:\n   plugin packages (containing a `yt_dlp_plugins` namespace folder) can be dropped into the following standard [configuration locations](#configuration):\n    * **user plugins**\n      * `${xdg_config_home}/yt-dlp/plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/` (recommended on linux/macos)\n      * `${xdg_config_home}/yt-dlp-plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/`\n      * `${appdata}/yt-dlp/plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/` (recommended on windows)\n      * `${appdata}/yt-dlp-plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/`\n      * `~/.yt-dlp/plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/`\n      * `~/yt-dlp-plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/`\n    * **system plugins**\n      * `/etc/yt-dlp/plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/`\n      * `/etc/yt-dlp-plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/`\n2. **executable location**: plugin packages can similarly be installed in a `yt-dlp-plugins` directory under the executable location (recommended for portable installations):\n    * binary: where `<root-dir>/yt-dlp.exe`, `<root-dir>/yt-dlp-plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/`\n    * source: where `<root-dir>/yt_dlp/__main__.py`, `<root-dir>/yt-dlp-plugins/<package name>/yt_dlp_plugins/`\n\n3. **pip and other locations in `pythonpath`**\n    * plugin packages can be installed and managed using `pip`. see [yt-dlp-sample-plugins](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-sample-plugins) for an example.\n      * note: plugin files between plugin packages installed with pip must have unique filenames.\n    * any path in `pythonpath` is searched in for the `yt_dlp_plugins` namespace folder.\n      * note: this does not apply for pyinstaller/py2exe builds.\n\n\n`.zip`, `.egg` and `.whl` archives containing a `yt_dlp_plugins` namespace folder in their root are also supported as plugin packages.\n* e.g. `${xdg_config_home}/yt-dlp/plugins/mypluginpkg.zip` where `mypluginpkg.zip` contains `yt_dlp_plugins/<type>/myplugin.py`\n\nrun yt-dlp with `--verbose` to check if the plugin has been loaded.\n\n## developing plugins\n\nsee the [yt-dlp-sample-plugins](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-sample-plugins) repo for a template plugin package and the [plugin development](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/plugin-development) section of the wiki for a plugin development guide.\n\nall public classes with a name ending in `ie`/`pp` are imported from each file for extractors and postprocessors repectively. this respects underscore prefix (e.g. `_mybasepluginie` is private) and `__all__`. modules can similarly be excluded by prefixing the module name with an underscore (e.g. `_myplugin.py`).\n\nto replace an existing extractor with a subclass of one, set the `plugin_name` class keyword argument (e.g. `class mypluginie(abuiltinie, plugin_name='myplugin')` will replace `abuiltinie` with `mypluginie`). since the extractor replaces the parent, you should exclude the subclass extractor from being imported separately by making it private using one of the methods described above.\n\nif you are a plugin author, add [yt-dlp-plugins](https://github.com/topics/yt-dlp-plugins) as a topic to your repository for discoverability.\n\nsee the [developer instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/contributing.md#developer-instructions) on how to write and test an extractor.\n\n# embedding yt-dlp\n\nyt-dlp makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language.\n\nyour program should avoid parsing the normal stdout since they may change in future versions. instead they should use options such as `-j`, `--print`, `--progress-template`, `--exec` etc to create console output that you can reliably reproduce and parse.\n\nfrom a python program, you can embed yt-dlp in a more powerful fashion, like this:\n\n```python\nfrom yt_dlp import youtubedl\n\nurls = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baw_jenozkc']\nwith youtubedl() as ydl:\n    ydl.download(urls)\n```\n\nmost likely, you'll want to use various options. for a list of options available, have a look at [`yt_dlp/youtubedl.py`](yt_dlp/youtubedl.py#l183) or `help(yt_dlp.youtubedl)` in a python shell. if you are already familiar with the cli, you can use [`devscripts/cli_to_api.py`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/devscripts/cli_to_api.py) to translate any cli switches to `youtubedl` params.\n\n**tip**: if you are porting your code from youtube-dl to yt-dlp, one important point to look out for is that we do not guarantee the return value of `youtubedl.extract_info` to be json serializable, or even be a dictionary. it will be dictionary-like, but if you want to ensure it is a serializable dictionary, pass it through `youtubedl.sanitize_info` as shown in the [example below](#extracting-information)\n\n## embedding examples\n\n#### extracting information\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport yt_dlp\n\nurl = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baw_jenozkc'\n\n#
