events component is a python library which doesn't need independent deployment. therefore,\nits setup is reasonably straightforward. first, it needs to be added to your service requirements,\nand then it will be installed alongside requirements of the service.\n\nif the service you intend to use is either the lms or cms, then the library is installed alongside\ntheir requirements since the maple release.\n\ngetting help\n************\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\nsee `documentation on read the docs <https://openedx-events.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nmore help\n=========\n\nif you're
