  "description": "=============\npython-gssapi\n=============\n\n\n\n\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/gh/pythongssapi%2fpython-gssapi.svg\n    :target: http://badge.fury.io/gh/pythongssapi%2fpython-gssapi\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/gssapi.svg\n    :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/gssapi\n\npython-gssapi provides both low-level and high level wrappers around the gssapi\nc libraries.  while it focuses on the kerberos mechanism, it should also be\nuseable with other gssapi mechanisms.\n\ndocumentation can be found at\n`https://pythongssapi.github.io/python-gssapi/ <https://pythongssapi.github.io/python-gssapi/>`_.\n\nrequirements\n============\n\nbasic\n-----\n\n* a working implementation of gssapi (such as from mit kerberos)\n  which supports delegation and includes header files\n\n* a c compiler (such as gcc)\n\n* python 3.7+ (older releases support older versions, but are unsupported)\n\n* the `decorator` python package\n\ncompiling from scratch\n----------------------\n\nto compile from scratch, you will need cython >= 0.29.29 which is automatically\ninstalled by pip in an isolated build virtual environment.\n\nfor running the tests\n---------------------\n\n* the `k5test` package\n\nto install test dependencies using pip:\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt # optional, for running test suite\n\ninstallation\n============\n\neasy way\n--------\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install gssapi\n\nfrom the git repo\n-----------------\n\nafter being sure to install all the requirements,\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi.git\n    $ pip install .\n\ntests\n=====\n\nthe tests for for python-gssapi live in `gssapi.tests`.  in order to\nrun the tests, you must have an mit kerberos installation (including\nthe kdc).  the tests create a self-contained kerberos setup, so running\nthe tests will not interfere with any existing kerberos installations.\n\nstructure\n=========\n\npython-gssapi is composed of two parts: a low-level c-style api which\nthinly wraps the underlying rfc 2744 methods, and a high-level, pythonic\napi (which is itself a wrapper around the low-level api).  examples may\nbe found in the `examples` directory.\n\nlow-level api\n-------------\n\nthe low-level api lives in `gssapi.raw`.  the methods contained therein\nare designed to match closely with the original gssapi c methods.  all\nrelevant methods and classes may be imported directly from `gssapi.raw`.\nextension methods will only be imported if they are present.  the low-level\napi follows the given format:\n\n* names match the rfc 2744 specification, with the `gssapi_`\n  prefix removed\n\n* parameters which use c int constants as enums have\n  `enum.intenum` classes defined, and thus may be passed\n  either the enum members or integers\n\n* in cases where a specific constant is passed in the c api to represent\n  a default value, `none` should be passed instead\n\n* in cases where non-integer constants would be used in the api (i.e.\n  oids), enum-like objects have been defined containing named references\n  to values specified in rfc 2744.\n\n* major and minor error codes are returned by raising\n  `gssapi.raw.gsserror`.  the major error codes have exceptions\n  defined in in `gssapi.raw.exceptions` to make it easier to catch specific\n  errors or categories of errors.\n\n* all other relevant output values are returned via named tuples.\n\nhigh-level api\n--------------\n\nthe high-level api lives directly under `gssapi`.  the classes\ncontained in each file are designed to provide a more pythonic, object-oriented\nview of gssapi.  the exceptions from the low-level api, plus several additional\nexceptions, live in `gssapi.exceptions`.  the rest of the classes may be\nimported directly from `gssapi`.  only classes are exported by `gssapi` --\nall functions are methods of classes in the high-level api.\n\nplease note that qop is not supported in the high-level api, since it has been\ndeprecated.\n\nextensions\n----------\n\nin addition to rfc 2743/2744, python-gssapi also has support for:\n\n* rfc 4178 (gss-api negotiation mechanism)\n\n* rfc 5587 (extended gss mechanism inquiry apis)\n\n* rfc 5588 (gss-api extension for storing delegated credentials)\n\n* rfc 5801 (gss-api sasl extensions)\n\n* (additional) credential store extension\n\n* services4user\n\n* credentials import-export\n\n* rfc 6680 (gss-api naming extensions)\n\n* dce and iov mic extensions\n\n* `acquire_cred_with_password` and `add_cred_with_password`\n\n* ggf extensions\n\n* kerberos specific extensions\n\nthe team\n========\n\n(github usernames in parentheses)\n\n* jordan borean (@jborean93) -
