platform.machine == \"x86_64\" or platform.machine == \"amd64\" or platform.machine == \"aarch64\"\n\n``setup.py``::\n\n    extras_require={\n        \":platform.machine == 'x86_64' or platform.machine == 'amd64' or platform.machine == 'aarch64'\": ['isal']\n    },\n\n.. dependency end\n\ndifferences with zlib and gzip modules\n--------------------------------------\n\n.. differences start\n\n+ compression level 0 in ``zlib`` and ``gzip`` means **no compression**, while\n  in ``isal_zlib`` and ``igzip`` this is the **lowest compression level**.\n  this is a design choice that was inherited from the isa-l library.\n+ compression levels range from 0 to 3, not 1 to 9. ``isal_zlib.z_default_compression``\n  has been aliased to ``isal_zlib.isal_default_compression`` (2).\n+ ``isal_zlib`` only supports ``no_flush``, ``sync_flush``, ``full_flush`` and\n  ``finish_flush``. other flush modes are not supported and will raise errors.\n+ ``zlib.z_default_strategy``, ``zlib.z_rle`` etc. are exposed as\n  ``isal_zlib.z_default_strategy``, ``isal_zlib.z_rle`` etc. for compatibility\n  reasons. however, ``isal_zlib`` only supports a default strategy and will\n  give warnings when other strategies are used.\n+ ``zlib`` supports different memory levels from 1 to 9 (with 8 default).\n  ``isal_zlib`` supports memory levels smallest, small, medium, large and\n  largest. these have been mapped to levels 1, 2-3, 4-6, 7-8 and 9. so\n  ``isal_zlib`` can be used with zlib compatible memory levels.\n+ ``igzip.open`` returns a class ``igzipfile`` instead of ``gzipfile``. since\n  the compression levels are not compatible, a difference in naming was chosen\n  to reflect this. ``igzip.gzipfile`` does exist as an alias of\n  ``igzip.igzipfile`` for compatibility reasons.\n+ ``igzip._gzipreader`` has been rewritten in c. since this is a private member\n  it should not affect compatibility, but it may cause some issues for\n  instances where this code is used directly. if such issues should occur,\n  please report them so the compatibility issues can be fixed.\n\n.. differences end\n\ncontributing\n------------\n.. contributing start\n\nplease make a pr or issue if you feel anything can be improved. bug reports\nare also very welcome. please report them on the `github issue tracker\n<https://github.com/rhpvorderman/python-isal/issues>`_.\n\n.. contributing end\n\nacknowledgements\n----------------\n\n.. acknowledgements start\n\nthis project builds upon the software and experience of many.  many thanks to:\n\n+ the `isa-l contributors\n  <https://github.com/intel/isa-l/graphs/contributors>`_ for making isa-l.\n  special thanks to @gbtucker for always being especially helpful and\n  responsive.\n+ the `cython contributors\n  <https://github.com/cython/cython/graphs/contributors>`_ for making it easy\n  to create an extension and helping a novice get start with pointer addresses.\n+ the `cpython contributors\n  <https://github.com/python/cpython/graphs/contributors>`_.\n  python-isal mimicks ``zlibmodule.c`` and ``gzip.py`` from the standard\n  library to make it easier for python users to adopt it.\n+ `@marcelm <https://github.com/marcelm>`_ for taking a chance on this project\n  and make it a dependency for his `xopen\n  <https://github.com/pycompression/xopen>`_ and by extension `cutadapt\n  <https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt>`_ projects. this gave python-isal its\n  first users who used python-isal in production.\n+ mark adler (@madler) for the excellent comments in his pigz code which made\n  it very easy to replicate the behaviour for writing gzip with multiple\n  threads using the ``threading`` and ``isal_zlib`` modules. another thanks\n  for his permissive license, which allowed the crc32_combine code to be\n  included in the project. (isa-l does not provide a crc32_combine function,\n  unlike zlib.) and yet another thanks to mark adler and also for\n  jean-loup gailly for creating the gzip format which is very heavily used\n  in bioinformatics. without that, i would have never written this library\n  from which i have learned so much.\n+ the `github actions team <https://github.com/orgs/actions/people>`_ for\n  creating the actions ci service that enables building and testing on all\n  three major operating systems.\n+ `@animalize <https://github.com/animalize>`_ for explaining how to test and\n  build python-isal for arm 64-bit platforms.\n+ and last but not least: everyone who submitted a bug report or a feature\n  request. these make the project better!\n\npython-isal would not have been possible without you!\n\n.. acknowledgements end\n",
