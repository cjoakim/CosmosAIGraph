  "description": ".. -*- rst -*-\n\n=========\ncolorzero\n=========\n\ncolorzero is a color manipulation library for python (yes, *another* one) which\naims to be reasonably simple to use and \"pythonic\" in nature.\n\nit does *not* aim to be as comprehensive, powerful, or that matter as *correct*\nas, say, `colormath`_.  colorzero originally grew out of work on my `picamera`_\nproject, hence it's intended to be sufficiently simple that school children can\nuse it without having to explain color spaces and illuminants. however, it does\naim to be useful to a wide range of skills, hence it does include basic\nfacilities for `cie lab`_ representations, and `delta-e`_ calculations should\nyou need them.\n\nthe major difference between colorzero and other libraries (`grapefruit`_,\n`colormath`_, etc.) is that its ``color`` class is a ``namedtuple`` descendent.\nthis means it is immutable; you cannot *directly* change the attributes of a\n``color`` instance. the major advantage of this is that instances can be used\nas keys in dictionaries (for simple `luts`_), or placed in sets.\n\nmanipulation of ``color`` instances is done by typical operations with other\nclasses the result of which is a new ``color`` instance. for example::\n\n    >>> color('red') + color('blue')\n    <color html='#ff00ff' rgb=(1, 0, 1)>\n    >>> color('magenta') - color('red')\n    <color html='#0000ff' rgb=(0, 0, 1)>\n    >>> color('red') - red(0.5)\n    <color html='#800000' rgb=(0.5, 0, 0)>\n    >>> color('green') + color('grey').red\n    <color html='#808000' rgb=(0.501961, 0.501961, 0)>\n    >>> color.from_hls(0.5, 0.5, 1.0)\n    <color html='#00ffff' rgb=(0, 1, 1)>\n    >>> color.from_hls(0.5, 0.5, 1.0) * lightness(0.8)\n    <color html='#00cccc' rgb=(0, 0.8, 0.8)>\n    >>> (color.from_hls(0.5, 0.5, 1.0) * lightness(0.8)).hls\n    hls(h=0.5, l=0.4, s=1.0)\n\nlinks\n=====\n\n* the code is licensed under the `bsd license`_\n* the `source code`_ can be obtained from github, which also hosts the `bug\n  tracker`_\n* the `documentation`_ (which includes installation, quick-start examples, and\n  lots of code recipes) can be read on readthedocs\n* packages can be downloaded from `pypi`_, but reading the installation\n  instructions is more likely to be useful\n\n\n.. _picamera: https://picamera.readthedocs.io/\n.. _colormath: https://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/\n.. _grapefruit: https://grapefruit.readthedocs.io/\n.. _cie lab: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lab_color_space\n.. _delta-e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/color_difference\n.. _pypi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorzero/\n.. _documentation: http://colorzero.readthedocs.io/\n.. _source code: https://github.com/waveform80/colorzero\n.. _bug tracker: https://github.com/waveform80/colorzero/issues\n.. _bsd license: http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-3-clause\n.. _luts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lookup_table#lookup_tables_in_image_processing\n\n\n",
