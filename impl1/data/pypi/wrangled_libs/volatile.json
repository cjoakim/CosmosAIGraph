  "description": "volatile\n========\n\ntemporary files and directories.\n\ncontains replacement for ``tempfile.namedtemporaryfile`` that does not delete\nthe file on ``close()``, but still unlinks it after the context manager ends,\nas well as a ``mkdtemp``-based temporary directory implementation.\n\n* mostly reuses the stdlib implementations, supporting the same signatures.\n* due to that, uses the os's built-in temporary file facilities, no custom\n  schemes.\n* tested on python 2.6+ and 3.3+\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\na typical use-case that is not possible with the regular\n``namedtemporaryfile``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import volatile\n\n    with volatile.file() as tmp:\n        # tmp behaves like a regular namedtemporaryfile here, except for that\n        # it gets unlinked at the end of the context manager, instead of when\n        # close() is called.\n\n        tmp.close()\n\n        # run the users $editor\n        run_editor(tmp.name)\n\n        buf = open(tmp.name).read()\n\n        # ...\n\ntemporary directories:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import volatile\n\n    with volatile.dir(): as dtmp:\n        pass  # ... can use directory here\n\n    # a missing dtmp will not throw an exception!\n\nunix domain sockets:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import volatile\n\n    with volatile.unix_socket(): as (sock, addr):\n        # sock is the bound socket, addr its address on the filesystem\n        pass  # ... can use directory here\n\nthe source is fairly short and contains `api docs in the comments\n<https://github.com/mbr/volatile/blob/master/volatile/__init__.py>`_.",
