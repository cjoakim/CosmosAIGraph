  "description": "============================================\ntraitsui: traits-capable windowing framework\n============================================\n\nthe traitsui project provides a toolkit-independent gui abstraction layer,\nwhich is used to support the \"visualization\" features of the\n`traits <http://github.com/enthought/traits>`__ package.\nyou can write a model using the traits api and specify a gui using the traitsui\napi (views, items, editors, etc.), and let traitsui and your selected toolkit\nback-end (qt or wx) take care of the details of displaying them.\n\nexample\n-------\n\ngiven a traits model like the following::\n\n    from traits.api import hastraits, str, range, enum\n\n    class person(hastraits):\n        name = str('jane doe')\n        age = range(low=0)\n        gender = enum('female', 'male')\n\n    person = person(age=30)\n\nand using traitsui to specify and display a gui view::\n\n    from traitsui.api import item, rangeeditor, view\n\n    person_view = view(\n        item('name'),\n        item('gender'),\n        item('age', editor=rangeeditor(mode='spinner', low=0, high=150)),\n        buttons=['ok', 'cancel'],\n        resizable=true,\n    )\n\n    person.configure_traits(view=person_view)\n\nit creates a gui which looks like this:\n\n.. image:: https://raw.github.com/enthought/traitsui/main/readme_example.png\n\nimportant links\n---------------\n\n- website and documentation: `<http://docs.enthought.com/traitsui>`__\n\n  * user manual `<http://docs.enthought.com/traitsui/traitsui_user_manual>`__\n  * tutorial `<http://docs.enthought.com/traitsui/tutorials>`__\n  * api documentation `<http://docs.enthought.com/traitsui/api>`__\n\n- source code repository: `<https://github.com/enthought/traitsui>`__\n\n  * issue tracker: `<https://github.com/enthought/traitsui/issues>`__\n\n- download releases: `<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/traitsui>`__\n\n- mailing list: `<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ets-users>`__\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nif you want to run traitsui, you must also install:\n\n- traits `<https://github.com/enthought/traits>`__\n- pyface `<https://github.com/enthought/pyface>`__\n\nyou will also need one of the following backends:\n\n- wxpython\n- pyside2\n- pyqt5\n\nbackends have additional dependencies and there are optional dependencies on\nnumpy and pandas for some editors.\n\ntraitsui along with all dependencies can be installed in a straightforward way\nusing the `enthought deployment manager <http://docs.enthought.com/edm/>`__,\n``pip`` or other package managers.\n\n.. end_of_long_description\n\nrunning the test suite\n----------------------\n\nto run the test suite, you will need to install git and\n`edm <http://docs.enthought.com/edm/>`__ as well as have a python environment\nwhich has install `click <http://click.pocoo.org/>`__ available. you can then\nfollow the instructions in ``etstool.py``.  in particular::\n\n    > python etstool.py test_all\n\nwill run tests in all supported environments automatically.\n",
