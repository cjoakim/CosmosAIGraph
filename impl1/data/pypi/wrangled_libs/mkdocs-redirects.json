  "description": "# mkdocs-redirects\n\nplugin for [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to create page redirects (e.g. for moved/renamed pages).\n\ninitially developed by [datarobot](https://www.datarobot.com/).\n\n## installing\n\n> **note:** this package requires mkdocs version 1.0.4 or higher.\n\ninstall with pip:\n\n```bash\npip install mkdocs-redirects\n```\n\n## using\n\nto use this plugin, specify your desired redirects in the plugin's `redirect_maps` setting in your `mkdocs.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nplugins:\n    - redirects:\n        redirect_maps:\n            'old.md': 'new.md'\n            'old/file.md': 'new/file.md'\n            'some_file.md': 'http://external.url.com/foobar'\n```\n\n_note: don't forget that specifying the `plugins` setting will override the defaults if you didn't already have it set! see [this page](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#plugins) for more information._\n\nthe redirects map should take the form of a key/value pair:\n\n- the key of each redirect is the original _markdown doc_ (relative to the `docs_dir` path).\n  - this plugin will handle the filename resolution during the `mkdocs build` process.\n    this should be set to what the original markdown doc's filename was (or what it _would be_ if it existed), not the final html file rendered by mkdocs\n- the value is the _redirect target_. this can take the following forms:\n  - path of the _markdown doc_ you wish to be redirected to (relative to `docs_dir`)\n    - this plugin will handle the filename resolution during the `mkdocs build` process.\n      this should be set to what the markdown doc's filename is, not the final html file rendered by mkdocs\n  - external url (e.g. `http://example.com`)\n\nduring the `mkdocs build` process, this plugin will create `.html` files in `site_dir` for each of the \"old\" file that redirects to the \"new\" path.\nit will produce a warning if any problems are encountered or of the redirect target doesn't actually exist (useful if you have `strict: true` set).\n\n### `use_directory_urls`\n\nif you have `use_directory_urls: true` set (which is the default), this plugin will modify the redirect targets to the _directory_ url, not the _actual_ `index.html` filename.\nhowever, it will create the `index.html` file for each target in the correct place so url resolution works.\n\nfor example, a redirect map of `'old/dir/readme.md': 'new/dir/readme.md'` will result in an html file created at `$site_dir/old/dir/index.html` which redirects to `../../new/dir/`.\n\nadditionally, a redirect map of `'old/dir/doc_name.md': 'new/dir/doc_name.md'` will result in `$site_dir/old/dir/doc_name/index.html` redirecting to `../../new/dir/doc_name/`.\n\nthis mimics the behavior of how mkdocs builds the site dir without this plugin.\n\n## developing\n\n### setup a virtualenv\n\ncreate a virtualenv using a method of your choice.\n\n```bash\nbrew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv\npyenv install 2.7.18\npyenv virtualenv 2.7.18 mkdocs-redirects\npyenv activate mkdocs-redirects\n```\n\n### build\n\n```bash\nmake build\n```\n\n### test\n\n```bash\nmake test\n```\n\n## releasing\n\n```bash\nmake release\n```\n\nit will prompt you for your pypi user and password.\n\nsee:\n\n- <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/>\n- <https://packaging.python.org/guides/migrating-to-pypi-org/>\n",
