  "description": "===========================\nsqlalchemy 2 stubs (legacy)\n===========================\n\nthese are interim pep-484 typing stubs for the\n`sqlalchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_ **1.4 release series only**. they\nare released concurrently along with a\n`mypy extension <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html>`_\nwhich is designed to work with these stubs, which assists primarily in the area\nof orm mappings.\n\nthe stubs replace the use of the \"sqlalchemy-stubs\" package published by\ndropbox. differences include that these stubs are generated against 1.4's api\nas well as some adjustments to the use of generics. the sqlalchemy2-stubs stubs\npackage **will not work with sqlalchemy 2.0, and will need to be explicitly /\nmanually uninstalled when upgrading to sqlalchemy 2.0**.\n\nthis project should be considered **alpha level** and is not as mature\nas the dropbox stubs for the initial release.\n\nsee the mypy plugin documentation at https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html\nfor an overview of how to use pep-484 annotations with orm mapped classes.\n\nfor sqlalchemy 2.0, when released, **the sqlalchemy2-stubs project is not\ncompatible**.  sqlalchemy 2.0 will be / is fully pep-484 typed inline and\nwill not be compatible with any stubs.  there unfortunately appears to be no\nstandard approach in python for the problem of a library that upgrades to\ninclude typing annotations inline, as typing tools will still consider\nany installed stubs to take precedence.  therefore **sqlalchemy2-stubs\nwill need to be manually uninstalled when upgrading to sqlalchemy 2.0**.\n\n\ncode of conduct\n---------------\n\nabove all, sqlalchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, and\nconstructive communication between users and developers.\nplease see our current code of conduct at\n`code of conduct <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html>`_.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nsqlalchemy is distributed under the `mit license\n<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.\n\n",
