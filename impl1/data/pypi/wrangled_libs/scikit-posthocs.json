  "description": "scikit-posthocs\n===============\n\n**scikit-posthocs** is a python package that provides post hoc tests for\npairwise multiple comparisons that are usually performed in statistical\ndata analysis to assess the differences between group levels if a\nstatistically significant result of anova test has been obtained.\n\n**scikit-posthocs** is tightly integrated with pandas dataframes and numpy\narrays to ensure fast computations and convenient data import and storage.\n\nthis package will be useful for statisticians, data analysts, and researchers\nwho use python in their work.\n\n\nbackground\n----------\n\npython statistical ecosystem comprises multiple packages. however, it still has\nnumerous gaps and is surpassed by r packages and capabilities.\n\n`scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ (version 1.2.0) offers *student*, *wilcoxon*,\nand *mann-whitney* tests that are not adapted to multiple pairwise comparisons.\n`statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`_ (version 0.9.0) features\n*tukeyhsd* test that needs some extra actions to be fluently integrated into\na data analysis pipeline. statsmodels also has good helper methods:\n``allpairtest`` (adapts an external function such\nas ``scipy.stats.ttest_ind`` to multiple pairwise comparisons) and\n``multipletests`` (adjusts *p* values to minimize type i and ii errors).\n`pmcmrplus <https://rdrr.io/cran/pmcmrplus/>`_ is a very good r package that\nhas no rivals in python as it offers more than 40 various tests (including post\nhoc tests) for factorial and block design data. pmcmrplus was an inspiration\nand a reference for *scikit-posthocs*.\n\n*scikit-posthocs* attempts to improve python statistical capabilities by\noffering a lot of parametric and nonparametric post hoc tests along with\noutliers detection and basic plotting methods.\n\n\nfeatures\n--------\n\n- *parametric* pairwise multiple comparisons tests:\n\n  - scheffe test.\n  - student t test.\n  - tamhane t2 test.\n  - tukeyhsd test.\n\n- *non-parametric* tests for factorial design:\n\n  - conover test.\n  - dunn test.\n  - dwass, steel, critchlow, and fligner test.\n  - mann-whitney test.\n  - nashimoto and wright (npm) test.\n  - nemenyi test.\n  - van waerden test.\n  - wilcoxon test.\n\n- *non-parametric* tests for block design:\n\n  - conover test.\n  - durbin and conover test.\n  - miller test.\n  - nemenyi test.\n  - quade test.\n  - siegel test.\n\n- other tests:\n\n  - anderson-darling test.\n  - mack-wolfe test.\n  - hayter (osrt) test.\n\n- outliers detection tests:\n\n  - simple test based on interquartile range (iqr).\n  - grubbs test.\n  - tietjen-moore test.\n  - generalized extreme studentized deviate test (esd test).\n\n- plotting functionality (e.g. significance plots).\n\nall post hoc tests are capable of p adjustments for multiple pairwise\ncomparisons.\n\ndependencies\n------------\n\n- `numpy and scipy packages <https://www.scipy.org/>`_\n- `statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`_\n- `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_\n- `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_\n- `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_\n\ncompatibility\n-------------\n\npackage is compatible with python 2 and python 3.\n\ninstall\n-------\n\nyou can install the package using ``pip`` :\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  $ pip install scikit-posthocs\n",
