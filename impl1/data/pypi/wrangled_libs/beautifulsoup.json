  "description": "beautiful soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information\nfrom web pages. it sits atop an html or xml parser, providing pythonic\nidioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.\n\n# discontinuation notice\n\nyou should use the 'beautifulsoup4' package instead of this package.\n\ndevelopment on the 3.x series of beautiful soup ended in 2011, and the\nseries will be discontinued on january 1, 2021, one year after the\npython 2 sunsetting date. at some point after that, the\n'beautifulsoup' pip package will be updated to a recent version of\nbeautiful soup. this will free up the 'beautifulsoup' package name to\nbe used by a more recent release.\n\nif you're relying on version 3 of beautiful soup, you really ought to\nport your code to python 3. a relatively small part of this work will\nbe migrating your beautiful soup code to beautiful soup 4.\n\n\n",
