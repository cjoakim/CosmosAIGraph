installation instructions, see the\n[documentation](https://spacy.io/usage).\n\n- **operating system**: macos / os x \u00b7 linux \u00b7 windows (cygwin, mingw, visual\n  studio)\n- **python version**: python 3.7+ (only 64 bit)\n- **package managers**: [pip] \u00b7 [conda] (via `conda-forge`)\n\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/spacy/\n[conda]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/spacy\n\n### pip\n\nusing pip, spacy releases are available as source packages and binary wheels.\nbefore you install spacy and its dependencies, make sure that your `pip`,\n`setuptools` and `wheel` are up to date.\n\n```bash\npip install -u pip setuptools wheel\npip install spacy\n```\n\nto install additional data tables for lemmatization and normalization you can\nrun `pip install spacy[lookups]` or install\n[`spacy-lookups-data`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-lookups-data)\nseparately. the lookups package is needed to create blank models with\nlemmatization data, and to lemmatize in languages that don't yet come with\npretrained models and aren't powered by third-party libraries.\n\nwhen using pip it is generally recommended to install packages in a virtual\nenvironment to avoid modifying system state:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .env\nsource .env/bin/activate\npip install -u pip setuptools wheel\npip install spacy\n```\n\n### conda\n\nyou can also install spacy from `conda` via the `conda-forge` channel. for the\nfeedstock including the build recipe and configuration, check out\n[this repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/spacy-feedstock).\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge spacy\n```\n\n### updating spacy\n\nsome updates to spacy may require downloading new statistical models. if you're\nrunning spacy v2.0 or higher, you can use the `validate` command to check if\nyour installed models are compatible and if not, print details on how to update\nthem:\n\n```bash\npip install -u spacy\npython -m spacy validate\n```\n\nif you've trained your own models, keep in mind that your training and runtime\ninputs must match. after updating spacy, we recommend **retraining your models**\nwith the new version.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **for details on upgrading from spacy 2.x to spacy 3.x, see the\n[migration guide](https://spacy.io/usage/v3#migrating).**\n\n## \ud83d\udce6 download model packages\n\ntrained pipelines for spacy can be installed as **python packages**. this means\nthat they're a component of your application, just like any other module. models\ncan be installed using spacy's [`download`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#download)\ncommand, or manually by pointing pip to a path or url.\n\n| documentation              |                                                                  |\n| -------------------------- |

spacy installation\npython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n\n# pip install .tar.gz archive or .whl from path or url\npip install /users/you/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0.tar.gz\npip install /users/you/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whl\npip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n### loading and using models\n\nto load a model, use [`spacy.load()`](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#spacy.load)\nwith the model name or a path to the model data directory.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\ndoc = nlp(\"this is a sentence.\")\n```\n\nyou can also `import` a model directly via its full name and then call its\n`load()` method with no arguments.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nimport en_core_web_sm\n\nnlp = en_core_web_sm.load()\ndoc = nlp(\"this is a sentence.\")\n```\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **for more info and examples, check out the\n[models documentation](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/models).**\n\n## \u2692 compile from source\n\nthe other way to install spacy is to clone its\n[github repository](https://github.com/explosion/spacy) and build it from\nsource. that is the common way if you want to make changes to the code base.\nyou'll need to make sure that you have a development environment consisting of a\npython distribution including header files, a compiler,\n[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/),\n[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and\n[git](https://git-scm.com) installed. the compiler part is the trickiest. how to\ndo that depends on your system.\n\n| platform    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **ubuntu**  | install system-level dependencies via `apt-get`: `sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev git` .                                                                                                                                                            |\n| **mac**     | install a recent version of [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), including the so-called \"command line tools\". macos and os x ship with python and git preinstalled.                                                                                        |\n| **windows** | install a version of the [visual c++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) or [visual studio express](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/express/) that matches the version that was used to compile your python interpreter. |\n\nfor more details and instructions, see the documentation on\n[compiling spacy from source](https://spacy.io/usage#source) and the\n[quickstart widget](https://spacy.io/usage#section-quickstart) to get the right\ncommands for your platform and python version.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/explosion/spacy\ncd spacy\n\npython -m venv .env\nsource .env/bin/activate\n\n# make sure you are using the latest pip\npython -m pip install -u pip setuptools wheel\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install --no-build-isolation --editable .\n```\n\nto install with extras:\n\n```bash\npip install --no-build-isolation --editable .[lookups,cuda102]\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udea6 run tests\n\nspacy comes with an [extensive test suite](spacy/tests). in order to run the\ntests, you'll usually want to clone the repository and build spacy from source.\nthis will also install the required development dependencies and test utilities\ndefined in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).\n\nalternatively, you can run `pytest` on the tests from within the installed\n`spacy` package. don't forget to also install the test utilities via spacy's\n[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\npython -m pytest --pyargs spacy\n```\n",
