  "description": "# pytest-jupyter\n\na set of pytest plugins for jupyter libraries and extensions.\n\n[![build status](https://github.com/jupyter-server/pytest-jupyter/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?query=branch%3amain++)](https://github.com/jupyter-server/pytest-jupyter/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?query=branch%3amain++)\n\n## basic usage\n\nfirst, install `pytest-jupyter` from pypi using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pytest-jupyter\n```\n\nthis installs the basic pytest-jupyter package that includes fixture definitions for the various jupyter-based pytest plugins.\n\nto use one of these plugins, you'll also need to install their dependencies. this requires a second `pip install` call. for example, if you'd like to use the `jupyter_server` plugin, you'll need to call:\n\n```bash\npip install \"pytest-jupyter[server]\"\n```\n\nthis *should* install everything you need for the plugin to work.\n\nto use a plugin, add it to the `pytest_plugins` list in the `conftest.py` of your project's root test directory.\n\n```python\n# inside the conftest.py\n\npytest_plugins = [\"pytest_jupyter.jupyter_server\"]\n```\n\nthis library includes an `echo_kernel`, which is useful to speed up testing.\nyou must have either `\"pytest-jupyter[server]\"` or `\"pytest-jupyter[client]\"`\ninstalled to use the echo kernel.\n\nthe `pytest_jupyter.jupyter_client` plugin provides an installed\n`echo_kernel_spec` as a fixture, and a `start_kernel` fixture\nthat provides a factory function that starts a kernel using the `echo` kernel\nby default.\n\n*note*: the server plugin also includes the client plugin, so you can use both\nsets of fixtures with `\"pytest_jupyter.jupyter_server\"`.  both the `client`\nand `server` plugins also include the core fixtures.\n\n*note*: the client and server plugins use `pytest-tornasync` for async\ntest suite running.  it may not compatible with `pytest-asyncio`, meaning\nthat all fixtures must be synchronous.  you can use the `asyncio_loop` fixture\nand run `asyncio_loop.run_until_complete` against an async function in your\nfixtures if needed.\n\nthe server fixures use the echo kernel by default.  to override this behavior,\noverride the `jp_server_config` fixture and add the following config:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"multikernelmanager\": {\n        \"default_kernel_name\": \"<desired_kernel_name\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nall fixtures inside the plugin (e.g. jupyter_server) will be available to all of your project's unit tests. you can use a fixtures by passing it as an argument to your unit test function:\n\n```python\nasync def test_jupyter_server_api(jp_fetch):\n    # send request to a temporary jupyter server web application\n    response = await jp_fetch(\"api/spec.yml\")\n\n    # confirm that the request is successful.\n    assert response.code == 200\n```\n\nyou can list the fixtures for a given plugin using the `--fixtures` argument from the pytest command line interface:\n\n```bash\npytest --fixtures -p pytest_jupyter.jupyter_server\n```\n\nor by calling the `pytest --fixtures` where the plugin is listed in the `pytest_plugins` variable of a given test directory.\n",
