  "description": "====\npyacq\n====\n\nversion 0.1 is quite drafty.\na version 0.2 is in preparation (summer 2015).\n\npyacq is a pure python simple framework for data acquisition.\nby data we mean : analog signal, digital signal, video, event.\npyacq use zmq and so offer a simple to distribute data across thread, process and machine\nto build more complex acquisition system.\n\npyacq implement a simple layer to inteact with some hardware device. here the list:\n    * on linux : all comedi device\n    * on windows : measurement computing device with universal library\n    * on linux/win : the emotiv eeg system.\n    * on linux/win : the brainvision eeg with the socket.\n    \npyacq also propose some basic visualisation with qt4 widget to be embeded in qt application:\n   * a simple but multi signal continuous oscilloscope.\n   * a online multisignal time frequency \n   * a multi signal oscilloscope in triggered mode.\n\n\nmore information\n----------------\n\n- github: https://github.com/samuelgarcia/pyacq\n- mailing list: \n- documentation: http://packages.python.org/pyacq/\n\nfor installation instructions, see doc/source/install.rst\n\n:copyright: copyright 2010-2012 by the pyacq team, see authors.\n:license: modified bsd license, see license.txt for details.",
