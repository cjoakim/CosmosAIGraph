  "description": "## microsoft azure sdk for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure billing client library.\n\nazure resource manager (arm) is the next generation of management apis\nthat replace the old azure service management (asm).\n\nthis package has been tested with python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.\n\nfor the older azure service management (asm) libraries, see\n[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)\nlibrary.\n\nfor a more complete set of azure libraries, see the\n[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).\n\n## usage\n\n\nto learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)\n\n\n\nfor docs and references, see [python sdk references](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)\ncode samples for this package can be found at [billing management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=getting%20started%20-%20managing&terms=getting%20started%20-%20managing) on docs.microsoft.com.\nadditional code samples for different azure services are available at [samples repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples\n\n\n## provide feedback\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in\nthe [issues](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project.\n\n![image](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fazure-mgmt-billing%2freadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 6.0.0 (2021-05-12)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model invoicesectionlistresult has a new parameter total_count\n  - model operationdisplay has a new parameter description\n  - model billingsubscriptionslistresult has a new parameter total_count\n  - model billingaccountupdaterequest has a new parameter notification_email_address\n  - model enrollmentaccount has a new parameter account_owner_email\n  - model customerlistresult has a new parameter total_count\n  - model operation has a new parameter is_data_action\n  - model billingaccount has a new parameter notification_email_address\n  - model addressdetails has a new parameter middle_name\n  - model billingprofile has a new parameter tags\n  - model enrollmentpolicies has a new parameter marketplace_enabled\n  - added operation group reservationsoperations\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - model enrollmentpolicies no longer has parameter marketplaces_enabled\n\n## 6.0.0b1 (2020-11-20)\n\nthis is beta preview version.\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\n- credential system has been completly revamped:\n\n  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\n  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`\n\n- the `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. example: `myclient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=true)`. for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n- you can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead\n- operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.lropoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.lropoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.\n- exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror` (`clouderror` has been removed).\n- most of the operation kwarg have changed. some of the most noticeable:\n\n  - `raw` has been removed. equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal http response for advanced user\n  - for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n\n**general new features**\n\n- type annotations support using `typing`. sdks are mypy ready.\n- this client has now stable and official support for async. check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.\n- this client now support natively tracing library like opencensus or opentelemetry. see this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.\n\n## 1.0.0 (2020-10-19)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model errordetails has a new parameter details\n  - added operation invoicesoperations.download_multiple_billing_subscription_invoice\n  - added operation invoicesoperations.get_by_id\n  - added operation invoicesoperations.download_invoice\n  - added operation invoicesoperations.list_by_billing_subscription\n  - added operation invoicesoperations.list_by_billing_account\n  - added operation invoicesoperations.download_billing_subscription_invoice\n  -
