  "description": "# microsoft azure sdk for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure logic apps management client library.\nthis package has been tested with python 3.6+.\nfor a more complete view of azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).\n\n## _disclaimer_\n\n_azure sdk python packages support for python 2.7 has ended 01 january 2022. for more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_\n\n# usage\n\n\nto learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)\n\n\n\nfor docs and references, see [python sdk references](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/logic-apps)\ncode samples for this package can be found at [logic apps management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=getting%20started%20-%20managing&terms=getting%20started%20-%20managing) on docs.microsoft.com.\nadditional code samples for different azure services are available at [samples repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)\n\n\n# provide feedback\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the\n[issues](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project. \n\n\n![impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fazure-mgmt-logic%2freadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 10.0.0 (2022-06-06)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model integrationserviceenvironment has a new parameter identity\n  - model workflow has a new parameter identity\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - operation integrationserviceenvironmentmanagedapisoperations.begin_put has a new parameter integration_service_environment_managed_api\n\n## 9.0.0 (2020-12-18)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model integrationserviceenvironmentproperties has a new parameter encryption_configuration\n\n## 9.0.0b1 (2020-10-31)\n\nthis is beta preview version.\nfor detailed changelog please refer to equivalent stable version 3.0.0 (https://pypi.org/project/azure-mgmt-logic/3.0.0/)\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\n- credential system has been completly revamped:\n\n  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\n  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`\n\n- the `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. example: `myclient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=true)`. for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n- you can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead\n- operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.lropoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.lropoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.\n- exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror` (`clouderror` has been removed).\n- most of the operation kwarg have changed. some of the most noticeable:\n\n  - `raw` has been removed. equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal http response for advanced user\n  - for a complete set of supported options, see the [parameters accept in request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n\n**general new features**\n\n- type annotations support using `typing`. sdks are mypy ready.\n- this client has now stable and official support for async. check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.\n- this client now support natively tracing library like opencensus or opentelemetry. see this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.\n\n## 4.0.0rc2 (2019-01-11)\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n  -

model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. all\n    positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments. to\n    keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for\n    python 2 and python 3. python 3 uses the \"\\*\" syntax for\n    keyword-only arguments.\n  - enum types now use the \"str\" mixin (class azureenum(str, enum)) to\n    improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.\n    while this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important,\n    and are documented here:\n    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others> at a glance:\n      - \"is\" should not be used at all.\n      - \"format\" will return the string value, where \"%s\" string\n        formatting will return `nameofenum.stringvalue`. format syntax\n        should be prefered.\n  - new long running operation:\n      - return type changes from\n        `msrestazure.azure_operation.azureoperationpoller` to\n        `msrest.polling.lropoller`. external api is the same.\n      - return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.lropoller`,\n        regardless of the optional parameters used.\n      - the behavior has changed when using `raw=true`. instead of\n        returning the initial call result as `clientrawresponse`,\n        without polling, now this returns an lropoller. after polling,\n        the final resource will be returned as a `clientrawresponse`.\n      - new `polling` parameter. the default behavior is\n        `polling=true` which will poll using arm algorithm. when\n        `polling=false`, the response of the initial call will be\n        returned without polling.\n      - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of\n        `msrest.polling.pollingmethod`.\n      - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after\n        polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right\n        away.\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n  - compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0\n\n## 2.1.0 (2017-04-18)\n\n  - add several new workflows methods\n\n**note**\n\nthis wheel package is now built with the azure wheel extension\n\n## 2.0.0 (2017-03-16)\n\n  - major new release(api version 2016-06-01)\n\n## 1.0.0 (2016-08-30)\n\n  - initial release\n      - workflow in apiversion 2016-06-01\n      - everything else api version 2015-08-01-preview\n\n\n",
