  "description": "=======\nastropy\n=======\n\n.. container::\n\n    |actions status| |circleci status| |coverage status| |pypi status| |documentation status| |pre-commit| |isort status| |black| |zenodo|\n\nthe astropy project (http://astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop a\nsingle core package for astronomy in python and foster interoperability between\npython astronomy packages. this repository contains the core package which is\nintended to contain much of the core functionality and some common tools needed\nfor performing astronomy and astrophysics with python.\n\nreleases are `registered on pypi <https://pypi.org/project/astropy>`_,\nand development is occurring at the\n`project's github page <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.\n\nfor installation instructions, see the `online documentation <https://docs.astropy.org/>`_\nor  `docs/install.rst <docs/install.rst>`_ in this source distribution.\n\ncontributing code, documentation, or feedback\n---------------------------------------------\n\nthe astropy project is made both by and for its users, so we welcome and\nencourage contributions of many kinds. our goal is to keep this a positive,\ninclusive, successful, and growing community by abiding with the\n`astropy community code of conduct <http://www.astropy.org/about.html#codeofconduct>`_.\n\nmore detailed information on contributing to the project or submitting feedback\ncan be found on the `contributions <http://www.astropy.org/contribute.html>`_\npage. a `summary of contribution guidelines <contributing.md>`_ can also be\nused as a quick reference when you are ready to start writing or validating\ncode for submission.\n\ngetting started with github codespaces\n--------------------------------------\n\ncodespaces is a cloud development environment supported by github. none of the astropy build machinery depends on it, but it is a convenient way to quickly get started doing development on astropy.\n\nto get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this \ud83d\udc47\n\n|codespaces|\n\na codespace will open in a web-based version of visual studio code. the `dev container <.devcontainer/devcontainer.json>`_ is fully configured with software needed for this project. feel free to take a look at `github codespaces support <https://support.github.com/features/codespaces>`_ page for help.\n\n**note**: dev containers is an open spec which is supported by `github codespaces <https://github.com/codespaces>`_ and `other tools <https://containers.dev/supporting>`_.\n\nsupporting the project\n----------------------\n\n|numfocus| |donate|\n\nthe astropy project is sponsored by numfocus, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the\nunited states. you can donate to the project by using the link above, and this\ndonation will support our mission to promote sustainable, high-level code base\nfor the astronomy community, open code development, educational materials, and\nreproducible scientific research.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nastropy is licensed under a 3-clause bsd style license -
