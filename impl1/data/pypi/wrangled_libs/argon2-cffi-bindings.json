  "description": "# low-level python cffi bindings for argon2\n\n*argon2-cffi-bindings* provides low-level [*cffi*](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/) bindings to the [*argon2*] password hashing algorithm including a vendored version of them.\n\n<!-- [[[cog\n# extract commit id; refresh using `tox -e cog`\nimport subprocess\nout = subprocess.check_output([\"git\", \"submodule\"], text=true)\nid = out.strip().split(\" \", 1)[0]\nlink = f'[**`{id[:7]}`**](https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2/commit/{id})'\nprint(f\"the currently vendored *argon2* commit id is {link}.\")\n]]] -->\nthe currently vendored *argon2* commit id is [**`f57e61e`**](https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2/commit/f57e61e19229e23c4445b85494dbf7c07de721cb).\n<!-- [[[end]]] -->\n\n> if you want to hash passwords in an application, this package is **not** for you.\n> have a look at [*argon2-cffi*] with its high-level abstractions!\n\nthese bindings have been extracted from [*argon2-cffi*] and it remains its main consumer.\nhowever, they may be used by other packages that want to use the *argon2* library without dealing with c-related complexities.\n\n\n## usage\n\n*argon2-cffi-bindings* is available from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi-bindings/).\nthe provided *cffi* bindings are compiled in api mode.\n\nbest effort is given to provide binary wheels for as many platforms as possible.\n\n\n### disabling vendored code\n\na copy of [*argon2*] is vendored and used by default, but can be disabled if *argon2-cffi-bindings* is installed using:\n\n```console\n$ env argon2_cffi_use_system=1 \\\n  python -m pip install --no-binary=argon2-cffi-bindings argon2-cffi-bindings\n```\n\n\n### overriding automatic *sse2* detection\n\nusually the build process tries to guess whether or not it should use [*sse2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sse2)-optimized code (see [`_ffi_build.py`](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi-bindings/blob/main/src/_argon2_cffi_bindings/_ffi_build.py) for details).\nthis can go wrong and is problematic for cross-compiling.\n\ntherefore you can use the `argon2_cffi_use_sse2` environment variable to control the process:\n\n- if you set it to ``1``, *argon2-cffi-bindings* will build **with** sse2 support.\n- if you set it to ``0``, *argon2-cffi-bindings* will build **without** sse2 support.\n- if you set it to anything else, it will be ignored and *argon2-cffi-bindings* will try to guess.\n\nhowever, if our heuristics fail you, we would welcome a bug report.\n\n\n### python api\n\nsince this package is intended to be an implementation detail, it uses a private module name to prevent your users from using it by accident.\n\ntherefore you have to import the symbols from `_argon2_cffi_bindings`:\n\n```python\nfrom _argon2_cffi_bindings import ffi, lib\n```\n\nplease refer to [*cffi* documentation](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html) on how to use the `ffi` and `lib` objects.\n\nthe list of symbols that are provided can be found in the [`_ffi_build.py` file](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi-bindings/blob/main/src/_argon2_cffi_bindings/_ffi_build.py).\n\n[*argon2*]: https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2\n[*argon2-cffi*]: https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/\n\n\n## project information\n\n*argon2-cffi-bindings* is available under the mit license, available from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi-bindings/), the source code and documentation can be found on [github](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi-bindings).\n\n*argon2-cffi-bindings* targets python 3.6 and later, including pypy3.\n\n\n### credits & license\n\n*argon2-cffi-bindings* is written and maintained by [hynek schlawack](https://hynek.me/about/).\nit is released under the [mit license](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/blob/main/license>).\n\nthe development is kindly supported by [variomedia ag](https://www.variomedia.de/).\n\nthe authors of *argon2* were very helpful to get the library to compile on ancient versions of visual studio for ancient versions of python.\n\nthe documentation quotes frequently in verbatim from the *argon2* [paper](https://www.password-hashing.net/argon2-specs.pdf) to avoid mistakes by rephrasing.\n\n\n#### vendored code\n\nthe original *argon2* repo can be found at <https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2/>.\n\nexcept for the components listed below, the *argon2* code in this repository is copyright (c) 2015 daniel dinu, dmitry khovratovich (main authors), jean-philippe aumasson and samuel neves, and under [cc0] license.\n\nthe string encoding routines in src/encoding.c are copyright (c) 2015 thomas pornin, and under [cc0] license.\n\nthe [*blake2*](https://www.blake2.net) code in ``src/blake2/`` is copyright (c) samuel neves, 2013-2015, and under [cc0] license.\n\n[cc0]: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n\n",
