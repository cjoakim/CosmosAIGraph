  "description": "formic: apache ant fileset and globs in python\n==============================================\n\n.. |v| image::\n  https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/formic2.svg\n  :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/formic2\n  :alt: last stable version (pypi)\n\n.. [doc] image::\n  https://readthedocs.org/projects/formic/badge/?version=latest\n  :target: https://formic.readthedocs.io/\n  :alt: readthedocs\n\nhistory\n-------\n\nformic is forked from https://bitbucket.org/aviser/formic. the original project only supports python2.7 and has not been maintained for a long time.\n\ni added python3 supports and fixed some issues.\nformic now can work on any python 2.6+ or python 3.4+ system. if not, please `file an issue <https://github.com/wolfhong/formic/issues/new>`_. yet not tested on other python version.\n\nformic has no runtime dependencies outside the python system libraries.\n\ninstall\n--------\n\nformic can be installed from the cheeseshop with easy_install::\n\n   $ easy_install formic2\n\nor pip::\n\n   $ pip install formic2\n\nquickstart\n----------\n\nonce installed, you can use formic either from the command line to find from the current directory::\n\n   $ formic -i \"*.py\" -e \"__init__.py\" \"**/*test*/\" \"test_*\"\n\nthis will search for files all python files under the current directory\nexcluding all `__init__.py` files, any file in directories whose name contains\nthe word 'test', and any files that start `test_`.\n\nyou can also find from the specified directory like below::\n\n   $ formic /specified/directory/can/ignore/ -i \"*.py\" \"**/test/**/*.txt\" \"*.ini\"\n\noutput from formic is formatted like the unix find command, and so can easily be combined with other executables, eg::\n\n    $ formic -i \"**/*.bak\" | xargs rm\n\nwill delete all `.bak` files in or under the current directory (but excluding vcs directories such as `.svn` and `.hg`).\n\nformic can also be integrated right into your python project::\n\n    import formic\n    fileset = formic.fileset(include=\"**.py\",\n                             exclude=[\"**/*test*/**\", \"test_*\"],\n                             directory=\"./\",\n                             symlinks=false, )\n\n    for file_name in fileset:\n        # do something with file_name\n        ...\n\nformic is always case-insensitive on nt, but can be either case-sensitive or case-insensitive on posix.\n\non nt::\n\n    $ formic ./test/ -i \"upp*\" \"upp*/\"\n    /some/where/formic/test/lower/upper.txt\n    /some/where/formic/test/upper/lower.txt\n    /some/where/formic/test/upper/upper.txt\n\non posix with case-insensitive::\n\n    $ formic ./test/ --insensitive -i \"upp*\" \"upp*/\"\n    /some/where/formic/test/lower/upper.txt\n    /some/where/formic/test/upper/lower.txt\n    /some/where/formic/test/upper/upper.txt\n\nwith case-sensitive::\n\n    $ formic ./test/ -i \"upp*\" \"upp*/\"\n    $\n\n\nthat's about it :)\n\nfeatures\n--------\n\nformic is a python implementation of apache ant `fileset and globs\n<http://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns>`_ including the directory wildcard `**`.\n\nfileset provides a terse way of specifying a set of files without having to enumerate individual files. it:\n\n1. **includes** files from one or more ant globs, then\n2. optionally **excludes** files matching further ant globs.\n\nant globs are a superset of ordinary file system globs. the key differences:\n\n* they match whole paths, eg ``/root/myapp/*.py``\n* \\*\\* matches *any* directory or *directories*, eg ``/root/**/*.py`` matches\n  ``/root/one/two/my.py``\n* you can match the topmost directory or directories, eg ``/root/**``, or\n* the parent directory of the file, eg ``**/parent/*.py``, or\n* any parent directory, eg ``**/test/**/*.py``\n\nthis approach is the de-facto standard in several other languages and tools,\nincluding apache ant and maven, ruby (dir) and perforce (...).\n\npython has built-in support for simple globs in `fnmatcher\n<http://docs.python.org/library/fnmatch.html>`_ and `glob\n<http://docs.python.org/library/glob.html>`_, but formic:\n\n* can recursively scan subdirectories\n* matches arbitrary directories *in* the path (eg ``/1/**/2/**/3/**/*.py``).\n* has a high level interface:\n\n  * specify one or more globs to find files\n  * globs can be used to exclude files\n  * ant, and formic, has a set of *default excludes*. these are files and\n    directories that, by default, are automatically excluded from all searches.\n    the majority of these are files and directories related to vcs (eg .svn\n    directories). formic adds ``__pycache__``.\n  * iterate through all matches in the sub-tree\n\n* is more efficient with many common patterns; it runs relatively faster on large directory trees with large numbers of files.\n\nabout\n-----\n\nformic is originally written and maintained by `andrew alcock <mailto:formic@aviser.asia>`_ of `aviser llp <http://www.aviser.asia>`_, singapore.\n\nbut now, i forked it on github and will maintain this project voluntarily for a long time.\n\n* `origin homepage <http://www.aviser.asia/formic>`_\n* `current issue tracker <https://github.com/wolfhong/formic/issues?status=new&status=open>`_\n* `current source <https://github.com/wolfhong/formic>`_ on github\n* `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/formic2>`_\n* `readthedocs <https://formic.readthedocs.io/>`_\n\n\n",
