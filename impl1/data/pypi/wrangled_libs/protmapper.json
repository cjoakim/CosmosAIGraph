  "description": "# protmapper\nthe protmapper maps references to protein sites to the human reference\nsequence based on uniprot, phosphositeplus, and manual curation.\n\n\n## installation\n\n### python package\nthe protmapper is a python package that is available on pypi and can be\ninstalled as:\n\n```\npip install protmapper\n```\n\n### docker container\nalternatively, the protmapper docker container can be run to expose it as\na rest api as:\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 8008:8008 labsyspharm/protmapper:latest\n```\n\n## command line interface\nin addition to supporting usage via a python api and a rest service,\nprotmapper also provides a command line interface that can be used as follows.\n\n```bash\nrun protmapper on a list of proteins with residues and sites provided in a\ntext file.\n\npositional arguments:\n  input                 path to an input file. the input file is a text file\n                        in which each row consists of four comma separated\n                        values, with the first element being a protein id, the\n                        second, the namespace in which that id is valid\n                        (uniprot or hgnc),third, an amino acid represented as\n                        a single capital letter, and fourth, a site position\n                        on the protein.\n  output                path to the output file to be generated. each line of\n                        the output file corresponds to a line in the input\n                        file. each linerepresents a mapped site produced by\n                        protmapper.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --peptide             if given, the third element of each row of the input\n                        file is a peptide (amino acid sequence) rather than a\n                        single amino acid residue. in this case, peptide-\n                        oriented mappings are applied. in this mode the\n                        following boolean arguments are ignored.\n  --no_methionine_offset\n                        if given, will not check for off-by-one errors in site\n                        position (possibly) attributable to site numbering\n                        from mature proteins after cleavage of the initial\n                        methionine.\n  --no_orthology_mapping\n                        if given, will not check sequence positions for known\n                        modification sites in mouse or rat sequences (based on\n                        phosphositeplus data).\n  --no_isoform_mapping  if given, will not check sequence positions for known\n                        modifications in other human isoforms of the protein\n                        (based on phosphositeplus data).\n\n```\n\n## documentation\nfor a detailed documentation of the protmapper, visit http://protmapper.readthedocs.io\n\n## funding\nthe development of protmapper is funded under the darpa automated scientific discovery framework project (aro grant w911nf018-1-0124).\n\n## citation\n\n```bibtex\n@article{bachman2019protmapper,\n  author = {bachman, john a and gyori, benjamin m and sorger, peter k},\n  doi = {10.1101/822668},\n  journal = {biorxiv},\n  publisher = {cold spring harbor laboratory},\n  title = {{assembling a phosphoproteomic knowledge base using protmapper to normalize phosphosite information from databases and text mining}},\n  url = {https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/11/06/822668.1},\n  year = {2019}\n}\n```\n",
