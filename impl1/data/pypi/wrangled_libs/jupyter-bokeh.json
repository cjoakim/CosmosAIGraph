  "description": "# jupyter_bokeh\n\n![github actions status](https://github.com/bokeh/jupyter_bokeh/workflows/build/badge.svg)\n\na jupyter extension for rendering [bokeh](https://bokeh.org) content within jupyter.  see also the separate [ipywidgets_bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/ipywidgets_bokeh) library for support for using jupyter widgets/ipywidgets objects within bokeh applications.\n\n\n## install\n\nfor versions 3.0 and newer of jupyterlab, you have the option to install\njupyter_bokeh with either ``pip`` or ``conda``:\n\n```bash\npip install jupyter_bokeh\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyter_bokeh\n```\n\nfor versions of jupyter lab older than 3.0, you must install the labextension\nseparately:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyter_bokeh\njupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager\njupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh\n```\n\nto install a specific version:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh@x.y.x\n```\n\n## compatibility\n\nthe core [bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) library is generally version independent of\n[jupyterlab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) and this ``jupyter_bokeh`` extension\nfor versions of ``bokeh>=2.0.0``.\n\nour goal is that ``jupyter_bokeh`` minor releases (using the [semver](https://semver.org/) pattern) are\nmade to follow jupyterlab minor release bumps, while micro releases are for new ``jupyter_bokeh`` features\nor bug fix releases. we've been previously inconsistent with having the extension release minor version bumps\ntrack that of jupyterlab, so users seeking to find extension releases that are compatible with their jupyterlab\ninstallation may refer to the below table.\n\n###### compatible jupyterlab and `jupyter_bokeh` versions\n\n| jupyterlab    | `jupyter_bokeh`  |\n| ------------- | ---------------- |\n| 0.34.x        | 0.6.2            |\n| 0.35.x        | 0.6.3            |\n| 1.0.x         | 1.0.0            |\n| 2.0.x         | 2.0.0            |\n| 3.0.x         | 3.0.0            |\n\n## contributing\n\n### development install\n\nnote: you will need nodejs to build the extension package.\n\nthe `jlpm` command is jupyterlab's pinned version of\n[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with jupyterlab. you may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# clone the repo to your local environment\n# change directory to the jupyter_bokeh directory\n# install package in development mode\npip install -e .\n# link your development version of the extension with jupyterlab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n# rebuild extension typescript source after making changes\njlpm run build\n```\n\nyou can watch the source directory and run jupyterlab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm run watch\n# run jupyterlab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nwith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running jupyterlab. refresh jupyterlab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\nby default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. to also generate source maps for the jupyterlab core extensions, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab build --minimize=false\n```\n\n### uninstall\n\n```bash\npip uninstall jupyter_bokeh\n```\n",
