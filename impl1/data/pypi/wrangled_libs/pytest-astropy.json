  "description": "==============\npytest-astropy\n==============\n\n.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/104255122.svg\n   :target: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/104255122\n   :alt: zenodo doi\n\nthis is a meta-package that pulls in the dependencies that are used by\n`astropy`_ and some `affiliated packages`_ for testing. it can also be used for\ntesting packages that are not affiliated with the astropy project.\n\nthis package also provides pytest markers for cpu and memory intensive tests\n(``pytest.mark.slow`` and ``pytest.mark.hugemem``). tests marked with those\nmarkers are not run by default, can be run with the other tests with\n``--run-slow`` and ``--run-hugemem``, and can be run separately with ``-m slow``\nand ``-m hugemem``.\n\nthe package also provides the short option ``-r`` for ``--remote-data``.\n\n.. _astropy: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/\n.. _affiliated packages: https://astropy.org/affiliated\n\ndependencies\n------------\n\nthe following dependencies are installed by this package:\n\n* the `pytest`_ testing framework for python.\n* `pytest-astropy-header`_, a ``pytest`` plugin used for custom test header.\n* `pytest-remotedata`_, a ``pytest`` plugin used for controlling access to data\n  files hosted online.\n* `pytest-doctestplus`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that provides advanced features\n  for testing example code in documentation.\n* `pytest-arraydiff`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that enables the generation and\n  comparison of data arrays produced during unit tests.\n* `pytest-filter-subpackage`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that adds a ``-p`` option to\n  pytest to filter by sub-package.\n* `pytest-mock`_,  a thin-wrapper around the mock package for easier use\n  with ``pytest``.\n* `pytest-cov`_, a ``pytest`` plugin to measure test coverage.\n* `hypothesis`_, a python library for property based testing.\n\n.. _pytest: https://doc.pytest.org\n.. _pytest-astropy-header: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy-header\n.. _pytest-remotedata: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-remotedata\n.. _pytest-doctestplus: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-doctestplus\n.. _pytest-arraydiff: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-arraydiff\n.. _pytest-filter-subpackage: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-filter-subpackage\n.. _pytest-mock: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock\n.. _pytest-cov: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov\n.. _hypothesis: https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nthe ``pytest-astropy`` plugin can be installed using ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install pytest-astropy\n\nit is also possible to install the latest development version from the source\nrepository::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy\n    $ cd pytest-astropy\n    $ python ./setup.py install\n\nin either case, the plugin will automatically be registered for use with\n``pytest``.\n\ndevelopment status\n------------------\n\nquestions, bug reports, and feature requests can be submitted on `github`_.\n\n.. _github: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy\n\nlicense\n-------\nthis package is licensed under a 3-clause bsd style license - see the\n``license.rst`` file.\n",
