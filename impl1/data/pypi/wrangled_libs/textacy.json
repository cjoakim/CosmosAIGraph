  "description": "## textacy: nlp, before and after spacy\n\n`textacy` is a python library for performing a variety of natural language processing (nlp) tasks, built on the high-performance spacy library. with the fundamentals --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. --- delegated to another library, `textacy` focuses primarily on the tasks that come before and follow after.\n\n[![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/chartbeat-labs/textacy/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/chartbeat-labs/textacy)\n[![current release version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/chartbeat-labs/textacy.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy/releases)\n[![pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/textacy.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/textacy)\n[![conda version](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/textacy/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/textacy)\n\n### features\n\n- access and extend spacy's core functionality for working with one or many documents through convenient methods and custom extensions\n- load prepared datasets with both text content and metadata, from congressional speeches to historical literature to reddit comments\n- clean, normalize, and explore raw text before processing it with spacy\n- extract structured information from processed documents, including n-grams, entities, acronyms, keyterms, and svo triples\n- compare strings and sequences using a variety of similarity metrics\n- tokenize and vectorize documents then train, interpret, and visualize topic models\n- compute text readability and lexical diversity statistics, including flesch-kincaid grade level, multilingual flesch reading ease, and type-token ratio\n\n... *and much more!*\n\n### links\n\n- download: https://pypi.org/project/textacy\n- documentation: https://textacy.readthedocs.io\n- source code: https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy\n- bug tracker: https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy/issues\n\n### maintainer\n\nhowdy, y'all. \ud83d\udc4b\n\n- burton dewilde (<burtdewilde@gmail.com>)\n",
