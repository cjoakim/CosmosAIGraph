  "description": "=====================================\nreadme\n=====================================\n\n(c) copyright reportlab europe ltd. 2000-2021.\nsee ``license.txt`` for license details.\n\nthis is a plugin for the reportlab pdf toolkit.\nwhich constructs rich pdf documents, and also creation\nof charts in a variety of bitmap and vector formats.\n\nthis plugin is intended to replace most of the usage of the\nlibart based c extension _renderpm which has been shown to\nhave issues when rendering complex documents.\n\nthis backend can be brought into use by setting \nreportlab.rl_config.renderpmbackend = 'rlpycairo'\nany of the methods detailed in reportlab/rl_config.py\ncan be used to accomplish this.\n\nthe new backend seems able to handle all the same behaviour as\n_renderpm and the only place where it seems inferior is in the\nrendering of scaled images and the speed with which it draws\ntext.\n\nat present the rlpycairo backend only uses the _renderpm extension \nto use its mapping of reportlab font names to extract paths for\nrendering this is no doubt the reason for its slowness when\nrendering text.\n\ncurrently we are not making use of any of the more advanced \nabilities of pycairo such as transparency, patterns etc,\nbut that may change in the future.\n\ncontents of this file:\n\n1. licensing\n\n2. installation\n\n   2.1 general prerequisites\n\n   2.2 source distribution mercurial\n\n\n3. prerequisites / dependencies\n\n4. documentation\n\n5. tests\n\n6. acknowledgements and thanks\n\n\n1. licensing\n============\nbsd license.  see ``license.txt`` for details.\n\n\n2. installation\n===============\n\nin most cases, pip install reportlab`` will do the job.\n\n\n2.1 general prerequisites\n--------------------------\nyou need to have installed python (versions 2.7 or >=3.6) and reportlab\nand ideally pil or pillow with freetype support; more notes on prerequisites\nfollow below.\n\n2.2. where to get the code\n------------------------------------------\nlatest sources are available from reportlab's\nopen source download area::\n\n    https://hg.reportlab.com/hg-pulic/rlpycairo\n\nyou can obtain the latest code from our mercurial repository with::\n\n    hg clone https://hg.reportlab.com/hg-public/rlpycairo\n\nall released packages are available from our pypi at\n\n\thttps://www.reportlab.com/pypi/\n\n\nmain releases are also available from the python package index:\n\n    https://pypi.python.org/\n\na mirror only repository is available for git users at\n\n\thttps://github.com/mrbitbucket/rlpycairo-mirror\n\nplease do not use this for issue reporting etc; use the mail list at\n\n    https://pairlist2.pair.net/mailman/listinfo/reportlab-users\n\n\n3. prerequisites / dependencies\n===============================\nthis works with python versions 2.7 or >=3.6. older versions are available\ngoing back to python 1.5 or thereabouts.\n\nthere are no absolute prerequisites beyond the python\nstandard library; but the python imaging library (pil or pillow)\nis needed to produce images with this package.\n\n4. documentation\n================\nthere is no documentation other than that provided in the reportlab package\nabout the standard renderpm renderer. this package is intended as an\nalternative to the lgpl_libart based backend reportlab.graphics._renderpm.\n\nto enable this backend the reportlab.rl_config.renderpmbackend should be set\nto the string 'rlpycairo'. use any of the methods outlined in\nreportlab/rl_config.py to accomplish this.\n\n5. test suite\n=============\ntests are in the ``reportlab/tests/`` directory.  they can be executed by cd'ing into the\ndirectory and executing ``python runall.py`` with an envinment variable\nset as rl_renderpmbackend=rlpycairo. obviously you need to have rlpycairo\ninstalled.\n\n6. acknowledgements and thanks\n==============================\nclaude paroz for failing examples of the base backend.\n",
