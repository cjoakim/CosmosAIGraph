(alive = visiting. die = decided the website wasn't for them)\n - understanding how frequently a patient may return to a hospital. (alive = visiting. die = maybe the patient moved to a new city, or became deceased.)\n - predicting individuals who have churned from an app using only their usage history. (alive = logins. die = removed the app)\n - predicting repeat purchases from a customer. (alive = actively purchasing. die = became disinterested with your product)\n - predicting the lifetime value of your customers\n\n### specific application: customer lifetime value\n\nas emphasized by p. fader and b. hardie, understanding and acting on customer lifetime value (clv) is the most important part of your business's sales efforts. [and (apparently) everyone is doing it wrong (prof. fader's video lecture)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guj2gveex4s). *lifetimes* is a python library to calculate clv for you.\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\npip install lifetimes\n```\n\n## contributing\n\nplease refer to the [contributing guide](https://github.com/camdavidsonpilon/lifetimes/blob/master/contributing.md) before creating any *pull requests*. it will make life easier for everyone.\n\n## documentation and tutorials\n[official documentation](http://lifetimes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n\n## questions? comments? requests?\n\nplease create an issue in the [lifetimes repository](https://github.com/camdavidsonpilon/lifetimes). \n\n## main articles\n\n1. probably, the seminal article of non-contractual clv is [*counting your customers: who are they and what will they do next?*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631608?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), by david c. schmittlein, donald g. morrison and richard colombo. despite it being paid, it is worth the read. the relevant information will eventually end up in this library's documentation though.\n1. the other (more recent) paper is [*\u201ccounting your customers\u201d the easy way:\nan alternative to the pareto/nbd model*](http://brucehardie.com/papers/018/fader_et_al_mksc_05.pdf), by peter fader, bruce hardie and ka lok lee.\n\n## more information\n\n1. [roberto medri](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/85/case%20study_%20what_s%20a%20customer%20worth_%20presentation.pdf) did a nice presentation on clv at etsy.\n1. [papers](http://mktg.uni-svishtov.bg/ivm/resources/counting_your_customers.pdf), lots of [papers](http://brucehardie.com/notes/009/pareto_nbd_derivations_2005-11-05.pdf).\n1. r implementation is called [btyd](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/btyd/vignettes/btyd-walkthrough.pdf) (*buy 'til you die*).\n1. [bruce hardie's website](http://brucehardie.com/), especially his notes, is full of useful and essential explanations, many of which are featured in this library.\n\n\n",
