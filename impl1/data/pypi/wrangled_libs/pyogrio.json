  "description": "# pyogrio - vectorized spatial vector file format i/o using gdal/ogr\n\npyogrio provides a\n[geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas)-oriented api to ogr vector\ndata sources, such as esri shapefile, geopackage, and geojson. vector data sources\nhave geometries, such as points, lines, or polygons, and associated records\nwith potentially many columns worth of data.\n\npyogrio uses a vectorized approach for reading and writing geodataframes to and\nfrom ogr vector data sources in order to give you faster interoperability. it\nuses pre-compiled bindings for gdal/ogr so that the performance is primarily\nlimited by the underlying i/o speed of data source drivers in gdal/ogr rather\nthan multiple steps of converting to and from python data types within python.\n\nwe have seen \\>5-10x speedups reading files and \\>5-20x speedups writing files\ncompared to using non-vectorized approaches (fiona and current i/o support in\ngeopandas).\n\nyou can read these data sources into\n`geodataframes`, read just the non-geometry columns into pandas `dataframes`,\nor even read non-spatial data sources that exist alongside vector data sources,\nsuch as tables in a esri file geodatabase, or antiquated dbf files.\n\npyogrio also enables you to write `geodataframes` to at least a few different\nogr vector data source formats.\n\nread the documentation for more information:\n[https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nwarning: pyogrio is still at an early version and the api is subject to\nsubstantial change. please see [changes](changes.md).\n\n## requirements\n\nsupports python 3.8 - 3.11 and gdal 3.4.x - 3.7.x.\n\nreading to geodataframes requires `geopandas>=0.12` with `shapely>=2`.\n\nadditionally, installing `pyarrow` in combination with gdal 3.6+ enables\na further speed-up when specifying `use_arrow=true`.\n\n## installation\n\npyogrio is currently available on\n[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyogrio)\nand [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyogrio/)\nfor linux, macos, and windows.\n\nplease read the\n[installation documentation](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)\nfor more information.\n\n## supported vector formats\n\npyogrio supports some of the most common vector data source formats (provided\nthey are also supported by gdal/ogr), including esri shapefile, geopackage,\ngeojson, and flatgeobuf.\n\nplease see the [list of supported formats](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_formats.html)\nfor more information.\n\n## getting started\n\nplease read the [introduction](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_formats.html)\nfor more information and examples to get started using pyogrio.\n\nyou can also check out the the [api documentation](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)\nfor full details on using the api.\n\n## credits\n\nthis project is made possible by the tremendous efforts of the gdal, fiona, and\ngeopandas communities.\n\n-   core i/o methods and supporting functions adapted from [fiona](https://github.com/toblerity/fiona)\n-   inspired by [fiona pr](https://github.com/toblerity/fiona/pull/540/files)\n",
