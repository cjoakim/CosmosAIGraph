(``provideinterface`` is\n  called implicitly when registering components from zcml.) the search\n  and query methods continue to return interfaces registered in base\n  site managers.\n\n  see `issue 10 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.component/issues/51>`_.\n\n4.6.2 (2020-07-03)\n==================\n\n- improve the documentation, both published and in docstrings. see `pr\n  49 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.component/pull/49>`_.\n\n\n4.6.1 (2020-03-23)\n==================\n\n- ensure the resolution order of ``baseglobalcomponents`` is\n  consistent. see `issue 45 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.component/issues/45>`_.\n\n\n4.6.0 (2019-11-12)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.8.\n\n- drop support for python 3.4.\n\n- fix tests on python 2 following changes in zodb 5.5.0.\n\n\n4.5.0 (2018-10-10)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.7.\n\n- always install ``zope.hookable`` as a dependency (the ``hook``\n  extra is now empty). ``zope.hookable`` respects the pure_python\n  environment variable, and has an optional c extension.\n\n- make accessing names that have been moved to ``zope.interface``\n  produce a ``deprecationwarning``.\n\n\n4.4.1 (2017-09-26)\n==================\n\n- remove obsolete call of ``searchinterface`` from\n  ``interfacetoname``. see https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.component/issues/32\n\n\n4.4.0 (2017-07-25)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.6.\n\n- drop support for python 3.3.\n\n- drop support for \"setup.py test\".\n\n- code coverage reports are now `produced and hosted by coveralls.io\n  <https://coveralls.io/github/zopefoundation/zope.component>`_, and\n  prs must keep them at 100%.\n\n- internal test code in ``zope.component.testfiles`` has been adjusted\n  and in some cases removed.\n\n\n4.3.0 (2016-08-26)\n==================\n\n- when testing ``pure_python`` environments under ``tox``, avoid poisoning\n  the user's global wheel cache.\n\n- drop support for python 2.6 and 3.2.\n\n- add support for python 3.5.\n\n\n4.2.2 (2015-06-04)\n==================\n\n- fix test cases for pypy and pypy3.\n\n\n4.2.1 (2014-03-19)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.4.\n\n\n4.2.0 (2014-02-05)\n==================\n\n- update ``boostrap.py`` to version 2.2.\n\n- reset the cached ``adapter_hooks`` at ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanup``\n  time (lp1100501).\n\n- implement ability to specify adapter and utility names in python. use\n  the ``@zope.component.named(name)`` decorator to specify the name.\n\n\n4.1.0 (2013-02-28)\n==================\n\n- change \"zodb3\" depdendency to \"persistent\".\n\n- ``tox`` now runs all tests for python 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n- enable buildout for python 3.\n\n- fix new failing tests.\n\n\n4.0.2 (2012-12-31)\n==================\n\n- flesh out pypi trove classifiers.\n\n\n4.0.1 (2012-11-21)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.3.\n\n\n4.0.0 (2012-07-02)\n==================\n\n- add pypy and python 3.2 support:\n\n  - security support omitted until ``zope.security`` ported.\n\n  - persistent registry support omitted until ``zodb`` ported (or\n    ``persistent`` factored out).\n\n- bring unit test coverage to 100%.\n\n- remove the long-deprecated ``layer`` argument to the\n  ``zope.component.zcml.view`` and ``zope.component.zcml.resource``\n  zcml directives.\n\n- add support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.\n\n- got tests to run using ``setup.py test``.\n\n- add ``sphinx`` documentation.\n\n- add ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs ``sphinx`` and dependencies).\n\n- add ``setup.py dev`` alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs\n  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).\n\n\n3.12.1 (2012-04-02)\n===================\n\n- wrap ``with site(foo)`` in try/finally (lp768151).\n\n\n3.12.0 (2011-11-16)\n===================\n\n- add convenience function zope.component.hooks.site (a contextmanager),\n  so one can write ``with site(foo): ...``.\n\n\n3.11.0 (2011-09-22)\n===================\n\n- move code from ``zope.component.registry`` which implements a basic\n  nonperistent component registry to ``zope.interface.registry``.  this code\n  was moved from ``zope.component`` into ``zope.interface`` to make porting\n  systems (such as pyramid) that rely only on a basic component registry to\n  python 3 possible without needing to port the entirety of the\n  ``zope.component`` package.  backwards compatibility import shims have been\n  left behind in ``zope.component``, so this change will not break any\n  existing code.\n\n- move interfaces from ``zope.component.interfaces`` to\n  ``zope.interface.interfaces``: ``componentlookuperror``, ``invalid``,\n  ``iobjectevent``, ``objectevent``, ``icomponentlookup``, ``iregistration``,\n  ``iutilityregistration``, ``iadapterregistration``,\n  ``isubscriptionadapterregistration``, ``ihandlerregistration``,\n  ``iregistrationevent``, ``registrationevent``, ``iregistered``,\n  ``registered``, ``iunregistered``, ``unregistered``,\n  ``icomponentregistry``, and ``icomponents``.  backwards compatibility shims\n  left in place.\n\n- depend on ``zope.interface`` >= 3.8.0.\n\n\n3.10.0 (2010-09-25)\n===================\n\n- remove the ``docs`` extra and the ``sphinxdoc`` recipe.\n\n- create a ``security`` extra to move security-related dependencies out of the\n  ``test`` extra.\n\n- use the new ``zope.testrunner`` package for tests.\n\n- add a basic test for the ``configure.zcml`` file provided.\n\n\n3.9.5 (2010-07-09)\n==================\n\n- fix test requirements specification.\n\n\n3.9.4 (2010-04-30)\n==================\n\n- prefer the standard library ``doctest`` to the one from ``zope.testing``.\n\n\n3.9.3 (2010-03-08)\n==================\n\n- the zcml directives provided by ``zope.component`` now register the\n  components in the registry returned by ``getsitemanager`` instead of the\n  global registry. this change allows the hooking of the ``getsitemanager``\n  method before the load of a zcml file to register the components in a\n  custom registry.\n\n\n3.9.2 (2010-01-22)\n==================\n\n- fix a bug introduced by recent refactoring, where passing\n  ``checkerpublic`` to ``securityadapterfactory`` wrongly wrapped the factory\n  into a ``locatinguntrustedadapterfactory``.\n\n\n3.9.1 (2010-01-21)\n==================\n\n- modify the tests to avoid allowing the tested testrunner to be influenced\n  by options of the outer testrunner, such a the ``-v`` option.\n\n\n3.9.0 (2010-01-21)\n==================\n\n- add testlayer support. it is now possible to load a zcml file within\n  tests more easily. see ``src/zope/component/testlayer.py`` and\n  ``src/zope/component/testlayer.txt``.\n\n\n3.8.0 (2009-11-16)\n==================\n\n- remove the dependencies on ``zope.proxy`` and ``zope.security`` from the\n  zcml extra: ``zope.component`` no longer has a hard dependency on them;\n  the support for security proxied components zcml registrations is enabled\n  only if ``zope.security`` and ``zope.proxy`` are available.\n\n- move the ``ipossiblesite`` and ``isite`` interfaces here from\n  ``zope.location`` as they are dealing with ``zope.component``'s concept of\n  a site, but not with location.\n\n- move the ``zope.site.hooks`` functionality to ``zope.component.hooks`` as it\n  isn't actually dealing with ``zope.site``'s concept of a site.\n\n\n3.7.1 (2009-07-24)\n==================\n\n- fix a problem, where ``querynextutility`` could fail if the context could\n  not be adapted to a ``icomponentlookup``.\n\n- fix 2 related bugs:\n\n  when a utility is registered and there was previously a utility\n  registered for the same interface and name, then the old utility is\n  unregistered.  the 2 bugs related to this:\n\n  - there was no ``unregistered`` for the implicit unregistration. now\n    there is.\n\n  - the old utility was still held and returned by\n    ``getallutilitiesregisteredfor``.  in other words, it was still\n    considered registered, eeven though it wasn't.  a particularly\n    negative consequence of this is that the utility is held in memory\n    or in the database even though it isn't used.\n\n\n3.7.0 (2009-05-21)\n==================\n\n- ensure that ``hookabletests`` are run by the testrunner.\n\n- add ``zope:view`` and ``zope:resource`` implementations into\n  ``zope.component.zcml`` (dependency loaded with ``zope.component [zcml]``).\n\n\n3.6.0 (2009-03-12)\n==================\n\n- important: the interfaces that were defined in the\n  ``zope.component.bbb.interfaces`` and deprecated for years are\n  now (re)moved. however, some packages, including part of zope\n  framework were still using those interfaces. they will be adapted\n  for this change. if you were using some of those interfaces, you\n  need to adapt your code as well:\n\n   - move ``iview`` and ``idefaultviewname`` to ``zope.publisher.interfaces``.\n\n   - move ``iresource`` to ``zope.app.publisher.interfaces``.\n\n   - remove ``icontextdependent``, ``ipresentation``, ``ipresentationrequest``,\n     ``iresourcefactory``, and ``iviewfactory`` completely.\n\n     if you used ``iviewfactory`` in context of ``zope.app.form``, there's now\n     ``iwidgetfactory`` in the ``zope.app.form.interfaces`` instead.\n\n- move ``getnextutility`` / ``querynextutility`` functions here from\n  ``zope.site`` (they were in ``zope.app.component`` even earlier).\n\n- add a pure-python ``hookable`` implementation, for use when\n  ``zope.hookable`` is not present.\n\n- remove use of ``zope.deferredimport`` by breaking import cycles.\n\n- cleanup package documentation and changelog a bit. add sphinx-based\n  documentation building command to the buildout.\n\n- remove deprecated code.\n\n- change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, because\n  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.\n\n\n3.5.1 (2008-07-25)\n==================\n\n- fix bug introduced in 3.5.0: ``<utility factory=\"...\">`` no longer supported\n  interfaces declared in python and always wanted an explicit\n  ``provides=\"...\"`` attribute. https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/251865\n\n\n3.5.0 (2008-07-25)\n==================\n\n- support registration of utilities via factories through the component\n  registry and return factory information in the registration information.\n  fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/240631\n\n- optimize ``un/registerutility`` by storing an optimized data structure for\n  efficient retrieval of already registered utilities. this avoids looping over\n  all utilities when registering a new one.\n\n\n3.4.0 (2007-09-29)\n==================\n\nno further changes since 3.4.0a1.\n\n\n3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)\n====================\n\ncorresponds to ``zope.component`` from zope 3.4.0a1.\n\n- in the zope 3.3.x series, ``zope.component`` was simplified yet once\n  more.  see http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/localcomponentmanagementsimplification\n  for the proposal describing the changes.\n\n\n3.2.0.2 (2006-04-15)\n====================\n\n- fix packaging bug:  ``package_dir`` must be a *relative* path.\n\n\n3.2.0.1 (2006-04-14)\n====================\n\n- packaging change: suppress inclusion of ``setup.cfg`` in ``sdist`` builds.\n\n\n3.2.0 (2006-01-05)\n==================\n\ncorresponds to the verison of the ``zope.component`` package shipped as part\nof the zope 3.2.0 release.\n\n- deprecated services and related apis. the adapter and utility registries\n  are now available directly via the site manager's 'adapters' and 'utilities'\n  attributes, respectively.  services are accessible, but deprecated, and\n  will be removed in zope 3.3.\n\n- deprecated all presentation-related apis, including all view-related\n  api functions. use the adapter api functions instead.\n  see http://dev.zope.org/zope3/implementviewsasadapters`\n\n- deprecated ``contextdependent`` package:  site managers are now looked up\n  via a thread global, set during url traversal.  the ``context`` argument\n  is now always optional, and should no longer be passed.\n\n\n3.0.0 (2004-11-07)\n==================\n\ncorresponds to the verison of the ``zope.component`` package shipped as part of\nthe zope x3.0.0 release.\n",
