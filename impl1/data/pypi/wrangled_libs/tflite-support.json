  "description": "tflite support is a toolkit that helps users to develop ml and deploy tflite models onto mobile devices.\n\nthis pypi package includes the python bindings for following features:\n\n - task library: a set of powerful and easy-to-use task-specific libraries to\n integrate tflite models onto various platforms. see the [task library\n documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/overview)\n for more information.\n - metadata schemas: wraps tflite model schema and metadata schema in python.\n - metadata writer and displayer: can be used to populate the metadata and\n associated files into the model, as well as converting the populated metadata\n into the json format. see the [metadata\n documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert/metadata) for more\n information.\n - android codegen tool: generates the java model interface used in android for\n a particular model. see the [codegen tool\n documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/codegen)\n for more information.\n",
