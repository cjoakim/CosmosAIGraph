  "description": "the gurobi optimizer is a mathematical optimization software library\nfor solving mixed-integer linear and quadratic optimization problems.\n\nthis package comes with a trial license that allows you to solve\nproblems of limited size.  as a student or staff member of an academic\ninstitution you qualify for a free, full product license. for\nmore information, see:\n\n* https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/\n\nfor a commercial evaluation, you can `request an evaluation license`_.\n\n.. _request an evaluation license:
