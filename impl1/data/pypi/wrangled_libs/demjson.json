  "description": "the \"demjson\" module, and the included \"jsonlint\" script, provide methods\nfor encoding and decoding json formatted data, as well as checking json\ndata for errors and/or portability issues.  the jsonlint command/script\ncan be used from the command line without needing any programming.\n\nalthough the standard python library now includes basic json support\n(which it did not when demjson was first written), this module\nprovides a much more comprehensive implementation with many features\nnot found elsewhere.  it is especially useful for error checking or\nfor parsing javascript data which may not strictly be valid json data.",
