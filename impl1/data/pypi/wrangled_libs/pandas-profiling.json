  "description": "# pandas-profiling\n\n---\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **`pandas-profiling` package naming was changed. to continue profiling data use [`ydata-profiling`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) instead!** \n\nthis repo implements the brownout strategy for deprecating the pandas-profiling package on pypi.\u26a0\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"500\" src=\"https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/assets/logo_header.png\" alt=\"pandas profiling logo\"></p>\n\n### \ud83c\udf8a new year, new face, more functionalities! \n> thank you for using and following ``pandas-profiling`` developments. yet, we have a new exciting feature - we are now thrilled to announce\n> that <u>spark</u> is now part of the data profiling family from version 4.0.0 onwards\n> \n> with its introduction, there was also the need for a new naming, one that will allow to decouple the concept of profiling from the pandas dataframes - `ydata-profiling`! \n> \n> but fear not, `pip install pandas-profiling` will still be a valid for a while, and we will keep investing in growing the best open-source for data profiling, so you can use it for even more use cases.\n# how to fix the error for the main use cases\n\n- use `pip install ydata-profiling` rather than `pip install pandas-profiling`\n- replace `pandas-profiling` by `ydata-profiling` in your pip requirements files (requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg, pipfile, etc ...)\n- if the `pandas-profiling` package is used by one of your dependencies it would be great if you take some time to track which package uses `pandas_profiling` instead of `ydata_profiling` for the imports\n\n## schedule for deprecation\n- `ydata-profiling` was launched in february 1st. \n- `pip install pandas-profiling` will still be supported until **april 1st**, but a warning will be thrown. `from pandas_profiling import profilereport` will be supported until april 1st.\n- after april 1st, an error will be thrown if `pip install pandas-profiling` is used. use `pip install ydata-profiling` instead.\n- after april 1st, an error will be thrown if `from pandas_profiling import profilereport` is used. use `from ydata_profiling import profilereport` instead.\n\n\n### about pandas-profiling\n`pandas-profiling` primary goal is to provide a one-line exploratory data analysis (eda) experience in a consistent and fast solution. like pandas `df.describe()` function, that is so handy, pandas-profiling delivers an extended analysis of a dataframe while alllowing the data analysis to be exported in different formats such as **html** and **json**.\n\nthe package outputs a simple and digested analysis of a dataset, including **time-series** and **text**. \n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/\">documentation</a>\n  |\n  <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/mw7xjj7b7s\">discord</a>\n  | \n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas-profiling\">stack overflow</a>\n  |\n  <a href=\"https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/pages/reference/changelog.html#changelog\">latest changelog</a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  do you like this project? show us your love and <a href=\"https://engage.ydata.ai\">give feedback!</a>\n</p>\n\n\n",
