  "description": "rtsp library for asyncio\n========================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.com/marss/aiortsp.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.com/marss/aiortsp\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/marss/aiortsp/badge.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/github/marss/aiortsp?branch=master\n\nthis is a very simple asyncio library for interacting with an\nrtsp server, with basic rtp/rtcp support.\n\nthe intended use case is to provide a pretty low level control\nof what happens at rtsp connection level, all in python/asyncio.\n\nthis library does not provide any decoding capability,\nit is up to the client to decide what to do with received rtp packets.\n\none could easily decode using `opencv <https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/>`_\nor `pyav <https://pypi.org/project/av/>`_, or not at all depending on the intended\nuse.\n\nsee ``examples`` for how to use the lib internals, butfor quick usage:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    import asyncio\n    from aiortsp.rtsp.reader import rtspreader\n\n    async def main():\n        # open a reader (which means rtsp connection, then media session)\n        async with rtspreader('rtsp://cam/video.sdp') as reader:\n            # iterate on rtp packets\n            async for pkt in reader.iter_packets():\n                print('pkt', pkt.seq, pkt.pt, len(pkt))\n\n    asyncio.run(main())\n",
