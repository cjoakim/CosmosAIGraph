  "description": "# replicate python client\n\nthis is a python client for [replicate](https://replicate.com). it lets you run models from your python code or jupyter notebook, and do various other things on replicate.\n\n> **\ud83d\udc4b** check out an interactive version of this tutorial on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k91q4p-ohl96fhbavlsv9flwfdu6pn3c).\n>\n> [![open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k91q4p-ohl96fhbavlsv9flwfdu6pn3c)\n\n## requirements\n\n- python 3.8+\n\n## install\n\n```sh\npip install replicate\n```\n\n## authenticate\n\nbefore running any python scripts that use the api, you need to set your replicate api token in your environment.\n\ngrab your token from [replicate.com/account](https://replicate.com/account) and set it as an environment variable:\n\n```\nexport replicate_api_token=<your token>\n```\n\nwe recommend not adding the token directly to your source code, because you don't want to put your credentials in source control. if anyone used your api key, their usage would be charged to your account.\n\n## run a model\n\ncreate a new python file and add the following code:\n\n```python\n>>> import replicate\n>>> replicate.run(\n        \"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:27b93a2413e7f36cd83da926f3656280b2931564ff050bf9575f1fdf9bcd7478\",\n        input={\"prompt\": \"a 19th century portrait of a wombat gentleman\"}\n    )\n\n['https://replicate.com/api/models/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/files/50fcac81-865d-499e-81ac-49de0cb79264/out-0.png']\n```\n\nsome models, like [methexis-inc/img2prompt](https://replicate.com/methexis-inc/img2prompt), receive images as inputs. to pass a file as an input, use a file handle or url:\n\n```python\n>>> output = replicate.run(\n        \"salesforce/blip:2e1dddc8621f72155f24cf2e0adbde548458d3cab9f00c0139eea840d0ac4746\",\n        input={\"image\": open(\"path/to/mystery.jpg\", \"rb\")},\n    )\n\n\"an astronaut riding a horse\"\n```\n\n> [!note]\n> you can also use the replicate client asynchronously by prepending `async_` to the method name. \n> \n> here's an example of how to run several predictions concurrently and wait for them all to complete:\n>\n> ```python\n> import asyncio\n> import replicate\n> \n> # https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl\n> model_version = \"stability-ai/sdxl:39ed52f2a78e934b3ba6e2a89f5b1c712de7dfea535525255b1aa35c5565e08b\"\n> prompts = [\n>     f\"a chariot pulled by a team of {count} rainbow unicorns\"\n>     for count in [\"two\", \"four\", \"six\", \"eight\"]\n> ]\n>\n> async with asyncio.taskgroup() as tg:\n>     tasks = [\n>         tg.create_task(replicate.async_run(model_version, input={\"prompt\": prompt}))\n>         for prompt in prompts\n>     ]\n>\n> results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n> print(results)\n> ```\n\n## run a model and stream its output\n\nreplicate\u2019s api supports server-sent event streams (sses) for language models. \nuse the `stream` method to consume tokens as they're produced by the model.\n\n```python\nimport replicate\n\n# https://replicate.com/meta/llama-2-70b-chat\nmodel_version = \"meta/llama-2-70b-chat:02e509c789964a7ea8736978a43525956ef40397be9033abf9fd2badfe68c9e3\"\n\nfor event in replicate.stream(\n    model_version,\n    input={\n        \"prompt\": \"please write a haiku about llamas.\",\n    },\n):\n    print(str(event), end=\"\")\n```\n\nfor more information, see\n[\"streaming output\"](https://replicate.com/docs/streaming) in replicate's docs.\n\n\n## run a model in the background\n\nyou can start a model and run it in the background:\n\n```python\n>>> model = replicate.models.get(\"kvfrans/clipdraw\")\n>>> version = model.versions.get(\"5797a99edc939ea0e9242d5e8c9cb3bc7d125b1eac21bda852e5cb79ede2cd9b\")\n>>> prediction = replicate.predictions.create(\n    version=version,\n    input={\"prompt\":\"watercolor painting of an underwater submarine\"})\n\n>>> prediction\nprediction(...)\n\n>>> prediction.status\n'starting'\n\n>>> dict(prediction)\n{\"id\": \"...\", \"status\": \"starting\", ...}\n\n>>> prediction.reload()\n>>> prediction.status\n'processing'\n\n>>> print(prediction.logs)\niteration: 0, render:loss: -0.6171875\niteration: 10, render:loss: -0.92236328125\niteration: 20, render:loss: -1.197265625\niteration: 30, render:loss: -1.3994140625\n\n>>> prediction.wait()\n\n>>> prediction.status\n'succeeded'\n\n>>> prediction.output\n'https://.../output.png'\n```\n\n## run a model in the background and get a webhook\n\nyou can run a model and get a webhook when it completes, instead of waiting for it to finish:\n\n```python\nmodel = replicate.models.get(\"ai-forever/kandinsky-2.2\")\nversion = model.versions.get(\"ea1addaab376f4dc227f5368bbd8eff901820fd1cc14ed8cad63b29249e9d463\")\nprediction = replicate.predictions.create(\n    version=version,\n    input={\"prompt\":\"watercolor painting of an underwater submarine\"},\n    webhook=\"https://example.com/your-webhook\",\n    webhook_events_filter=[\"completed\"]\n)\n```\n\nfor details on receiving webhooks, see [replicate.com/docs/webhooks](https://replicate.com/docs/webhooks).\n\n## compose models into a pipeline\n\nyou can run a model and feed the output into another model:\n\n```python\nlaionide = replicate.models.get(\"afiaka87/laionide-v4\").versions.get(\"b21cbe271e65c1718f2999b038c18b45e21e4fba961181fbfae9342fc53b9e05\")\nswinir = replicate.models.get(\"jingyunliang/swinir\").versions.get(\"660d922d33153019e8c263a3bba265de882e7f4f70396546b6c9c8f9d47a021a\")\nimage = laionide.predict(prompt=\"avocado armchair\")\nupscaled_image = swinir.predict(image=image)\n```\n\n## get output from a running model\n\nrun a model and get its output while it's running:\n\n```python\niterator = replicate.run(\n    \"pixray/text2image:5c347a4bfa1d4523a58ae614c2194e15f2ae682b57e3797a5bb468920aa70ebf\",\n    input={\"prompts\": \"san francisco sunset\"}\n)\n\nfor image in iterator:\n    display(image)\n```\n\n## cancel a prediction\n\nyou can cancel a running prediction:\n\n```python\n>>> model = replicate.models.get(\"kvfrans/clipdraw\")\n>>> version = model.versions.get(\"5797a99edc939ea0e9242d5e8c9cb3bc7d125b1eac21bda852e5cb79ede2cd9b\")\n>>> prediction = replicate.predictions.create(\n        version=version,\n        input={\"prompt\":\"watercolor painting of an underwater submarine\"}\n    )\n\n>>> prediction.status\n'starting'\n\n>>> prediction.cancel()\n\n>>> prediction.reload()\n>>> prediction.status\n'canceled'\n```\n\n## list predictions\n\nyou can list all the predictions you've run:\n\n```python\nreplicate.predictions.list()\n# [<prediction: 8b0ba5ab4d85>, <prediction: 494900564e8c>]\n```\n\nlists of predictions are paginated. you can get the next page of predictions by passing the `next` property as an argument to the `list` method:\n\n```python\npage1 = replicate.predictions.list()\n\nif page1.next:\n    page2 = replicate.predictions.list(page1.next)\n```\n\n## load output files\n\noutput files are returned as https urls. you can load an output file as a buffer:\n\n```python\nimport replicate\nfrom urllib.request import urlretrieve\n\nmodel = replicate.models.get(\"stability-ai/stable-diffusion\")\nversion = model.versions.get(\"27b93a2413e7f36cd83da926f3656280b2931564ff050bf9575f1fdf9bcd7478\")\nout = version.predict(prompt=\"wavy colorful abstract patterns, cgsociety\")\nurlretrieve(out[0], \"/tmp/out.png\")\nbackground = image.open(\"/tmp/out.png\")\n```\n\n## list models\n\nyou can the models you've created:\n\n```python\nreplicate.models.list()\n```\n\nlists of models are paginated. you can get the next page of models by passing the `next` property as an argument to the `list` method, or you can use the `paginate` method to fetch pages automatically.\n\n```python\n# automatic pagination using `replicate.paginate` (recommended)\nmodels = []\nfor page in replicate.paginate(replicate.models.list):\n    models.extend(page.results)\n    if len(models) > 100:\n        break\n\n# manual pagination using `next` cursors\npage = replicate.models.list()\nwhile page:\n    models.extend(page.results)\n    if len(models) > 100:\n          break\n    page = replicate.models.list(page.next) if page.next else none\n```\n\nyou can also find collections of featured models on replicate:\n\n```python\n>>> collections = [collection for page in replicate.paginate(replicate.collections.list) for collection in page]\n>>> collections[0].slug\n\"vision-models\"\n>>> collections[0].description\n\"multimodal large language models with vision capabilities like object detection and optical character recognition (ocr)\"\n\n>>> replicate.collections.get(\"text-to-image\").models\n[<model: stability-ai/sdxl>, ...]\n```\n\n## create a model\n\nyou can create a model for a user or organization\nwith a given name, visibility, and hardware sku:\n\n```python\nimport replicate\n\nmodel = replicate.models.create(\n    owner=\"your-username\",\n    name=\"my-model\",\n    visibility=\"public\",\n    hardware=\"gpu-a40-large\"\n)\n```\n\nhere's how to list of all the available hardware for running models on replicate:\n\n```python\n>>> [hw.sku for hw in replicate.hardware.list()]\n['cpu', 'gpu-t4', 'gpu-a40-small', 'gpu-a40-large']\n```\n\n## development\n\nsee [contributing.md](contributing.md)\n",
