  "description": "# honeycomb beeline for python\n\n[![oss lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/osslifecycle/honeycombio/beeline-python?color=success)](https://github.com/honeycombio/home/blob/main/honeycomb-oss-lifecycle-and-practices.md)\n[![build status](https://circleci.com/gh/honeycombio/beeline-python.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/honeycombio/beeline-python)\n\n**note**: honeycomb embraces opentelemetry as the effective way to instrument applications. for any new observability efforts, we recommend [instrumenting with opentelemetry](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/python-distro/).\n\nthis package makes it easy to instrument your python web application to send useful events to [honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io), a service for debugging your software in production.\n\n- [usage and examples](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/beelines/beeline-python/)\n- [api reference](https://honeycombio.github.io/beeline-python/)\n\n## compatible with\n\ncurrently, supports django (>3.2), flask, bottle, and tornado.\n\ncompatible with python >3.7.\n\n## updating to 3.3.0\n\nversion 3.3.0 added support for environment & services, which changes sending behavior based on api key.\n\nif you are using the [filetransmission](https://github.com/honeycombio/libhoney-py/blob/main/libhoney/transmission.py#l448) method and setting a false api key - and still working in classic mode - you must update the key to be 32 characters in length to keep the same behavior.\n\n## contributions\n\nfeatures, bug fixes and other changes to `beeline-python` are gladly accepted.\n\nif you add a new test module, be sure and update `beeline.test_suite` to pick up the new tests.\n\nall contributions will be released under the apache license 2.0.\n",
