for ``flake8`` finding likely bugs and design problems in your\nprogram.  contains warnings that don't belong in ``pyflakes`` and\n``pycodestyle``::\n\n    bug\u00b7bear  (b\u016dg\u2032b\u00e2r\u2032)\n    n.\n    1. a cause of fear, anxiety, or irritation: *overcrowding is often\n       a bugbear for train commuters.*\n    2. a difficult or persistent problem: *\"one of the major bugbears of\n       traditional ai is the difficulty of programming computers to\n       recognize that different but similar objects are instances of the\n       same type of thing\" (jack copeland).*\n    3. a fearsome imaginary creature, especially one evoked to frighten\n       children.\n\nit is felt that these lints don't belong in the main python tools as they\nare very opinionated and do not have a pep or standard behind them. due to\n``flake8`` being designed to be extensible, the original creators of these lints\nbelieved that a plugin was the best route. this has resulted in better development\nvelocity for contributors and adaptive deployment for ``flake8`` users.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\ninstall from ``pip`` with:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n     pip install flake8-bugbear\n\nit will then automatically be run as part of ``flake8``; you can check it has\nbeen picked up with:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    $ flake8 --version\n    3.5.0 (assertive: 1.0.1, flake8-bugbear: 18.2.0, flake8-comprehensions: 1.4.1, mccabe: 0.6.1, pycodestyle: 2.3.1, pyflakes: 1.6.0) cpython 3.7.0 on darwin\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n\nif you'd like to do a pr we have development instructions `here <https://github.com/pycqa/flake8-bugbear/blob/master/development.md>`_.\n\nlist of warnings\n----------------\n\n**b001**: do not use bare ``except:``, it also catches unexpected events\nlike memory errors, interrupts, system exit, and so on.  prefer ``except\nexception:``.  if you're sure what you're doing, be explicit and write\n``except baseexception:``.  disable ``e722`` to avoid duplicate warnings.\n\n**b002**: python does not support the unary prefix increment. writing\n``++n`` is equivalent to ``+(+(n))``, which equals ``n``. you meant ``n\n+= 1``.\n\n**b003**: assigning to ``os.environ`` doesn't clear the\nenvironment.  subprocesses are going to see outdated\nvariables, in disagreement with the current process.  use\n``os.environ.clear()`` or the ``env=``  argument to popen.\n\n**b004**: using ``hasattr(x, '__call__')`` to test if ``x`` is callable\nis unreliable.  if ``x`` implements custom ``__getattr__`` or its\n``__call__`` is itself not callable, you might get misleading\nresults.  use ``callable(x)`` for consistent results.\n\n**b005**: using ``.strip()`` with multi-character strings is misleading\nthe reader. it looks like stripping a substring. move your\ncharacter set to a constant if this is deliberate. use\n``.replace()``, ``.removeprefix()``, ``.removesuffix()`` or regular\nexpressions to remove string fragments.\n\n**b006**: do not use mutable data structures for argument defaults.  they\nare created during function definition time. all calls to the function\nreuse this one instance of that data structure, persisting changes\nbetween them.\n\n**b007**: loop control variable not used within the loop body.  if this is\nintended, start the name with an underscore.\n\n**b008**: do not perform function calls in argument defaults.  the call is\nperformed only once at function definition time. all calls to your\nfunction will reuse the result of that definition-time function call.  if\nthis is intended, assign the function call to a module-level variable and\nuse that variable as a default value.\n\n**b009**: do not call ``getattr(x, 'attr')``, instead use normal\nproperty access: ``x.attr``. missing a default to ``getattr`` will cause\nan ``attributeerror`` to be raised for non-existent properties. there is\nno additional safety in using ``getattr`` if you know the attribute name\nahead of time.\n\n**b010**: do not call ``setattr(x, 'attr', val)``, instead use normal\nproperty access: ``x.attr = val``. there is no additional safety in\nusing ``setattr`` if you know the attribute name ahead of time.\n\n**b011**: do not call ``assert false`` since ``python -o`` removes these calls.\ninstead callers should ``raise assertionerror()``.\n\n**b012**: use of ``break``, ``continue`` or ``return`` inside ``finally`` blocks will\nsilence exceptions or override return values from the ``try`` or ``except`` blocks.\nto silence an exception, do it explicitly in the ``except`` block. to properly use\na ``break``, ``continue`` or ``return`` refactor your code so these statements are not\nin the ``finally`` block.\n\n**b013**: a length-one tuple literal is redundant.  write ``except someerror:``\ninstead of ``except (someerror,):``.\n\n**b014**: redundant exception types in ``except (exception, typeerror):``.\nwrite ``except exception:``, which catches exactly the same exceptions.\n\n**b015**: pointless comparison. this comparison does nothing but\nwaste cpu instructions. either prepend ``assert`` or remove it.\n\n**b016**: cannot raise a literal. did you intend to return it or raise\nan exception?\n\n**b017**: ``assertraises(exception)`` and ``pytest.raises(exception)`` should\nbe considered evil. they can lead to your test passing even if the\ncode being tested is never executed due to a typo. assert for a more\nspecific exception (builtin or custom), or use ``assertraisesregex``\n(if using ``assertraises``), or add the ``match`` keyword argument (if\nusing ``pytest.raises``), or use the context manager form with a target\n(e.g. ``with self.assertraises(exception) as ex:``).\n\n**b018**: found useless expression. either assign it to a variable or remove it.\nnote that dangling commas will cause things to be interpreted as useless tuples.\nfor example, in the statement ``print(\"..\"),`` is the same as ``(print(\"..\"),)``\nwhich is an unassigned tuple. simply remove the comma to clear the error.\n\n**b019**: use of ``functools.lru_cache`` or ``functools.cache`` on methods\ncan lead to memory leaks. the cache may retain instance references, preventing\ngarbage collection.\n\n**b020**: loop control variable overrides iterable it iterates\n\n**b021**: f-string used as docstring. this will be interpreted by python\nas a joined string rather than a docstring.\n\n**b022**: no arguments passed to `contextlib.suppress`.\nno exceptions will be suppressed and therefore this context manager is redundant.\nn.b. this rule currently does not flag `suppress` calls to avoid potential false\npositives due to similarly named user-defined functions.\n\n**b023**: functions defined inside a loop must not use variables redefined in\nthe loop, because `late-binding closures are a classic gotcha\n<https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#late-binding-closures>`__.\n\n**b024**: abstract base class has methods, but none of them are abstract. this\nis not necessarily an error, but you might have forgotten to add the @abstractmethod\ndecorator, potentially in conjunction with @classmethod, @property and/or @staticmethod.\n\n**b025**: ``try-except`` block with duplicate exceptions found.\nthis check identifies exception types that are specified in multiple ``except``\nclauses. the first specification is the only one ever considered, so all others can be removed.\n\n**b026**: star-arg unpacking after a keyword argument is strongly discouraged, because\nit only works when the keyword parameter is declared after all parameters supplied by\nthe unpacked sequence, and this change of ordering can surprise and mislead readers.\nthere was `cpython discussion of disallowing this syntax\n<https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82741>`_, but legacy usage and parser\nlimitations make it difficult.\n\n**b027**: empty method in abstract base class, but has no abstract decorator. consider adding @abstractmethod.\n\n**b028**: no explicit stacklevel argument found. the warn method from the warnings module uses a\nstacklevel of 1 by default. this will only show a stack trace for the line on which the warn method is called.\nit is therefore recommended to use a stacklevel of 2 or greater to provide more information to the user.\n\n**b029**: using ``except ():`` with an empty tuple does not handle/catch anything. add exceptions to handle.\n\n**b030**: except handlers should only be exception classes or tuples of exception classes.\n\n**b031**: using the generator returned from `itertools.groupby()` more than once will do nothing on the\nsecond usage. save the result to a list if the result is needed multiple times.\n\n**b032**: possible unintentional type annotation (using ``:``). did you mean to assign (using ``=``)?\n\n**b033**: sets should not contain duplicate items. duplicate items will be replaced with a single item at runtime.\n\n**b034**: calls to `re.sub`, `re.subn` or `re.split` should pass `flags` or `count`/`maxsplit` as keyword arguments. it is commonly assumed that `flags` is the third positional parameter, forgetting about `count`/`maxsplit`, since many other `re` module functions are of the form `f(pattern, string, flags)`.\n\n**b035**: found dict comprehension with a static key - either a constant value or variable not from the comprehension expression. this will result in a dict with a single key that was repeatedly overwritten.\n\nopinionated warnings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nthe following warnings are disabled by default because they are\ncontroversial.  they may or may not apply to you, enable them explicitly\nin your configuration if you find them useful.  read below on how to\nenable.\n\n**b901**: using ``return x`` in a generator function used to be\nsyntactically invalid in python 2. in python 3 ``return x`` can be used\nin a generator as a return value in conjunction with ``yield from``.\nusers coming from python 2 may expect the old behavior which might lead\nto bugs.  use native ``async def`` coroutines or mark intentional\n``return x`` usage with ``# noqa`` on the same line.\n\n**b902**: invalid first argument used for method. use ``self`` for\ninstance methods, and ``cls`` for class methods (which includes ``__new__``\nand ``__init_subclass__``) or instance methods of metaclasses (detected as\nclasses directly inheriting from ``type``).\n\n**b903**: use ``collections.namedtuple`` (or ``typing.namedtuple``) for\ndata classes that only set attributes in an ``__init__`` method, and do\nnothing else. if the attributes should be mutable, define the attributes\nin ``__slots__`` to save per-instance memory and to prevent accidentally\ncreating additional attributes on instances.\n\n**b904**: within an ``except`` clause, raise exceptions with ``raise ... from err``\nor ``raise ... from none`` to distinguish them from errors in exception handling.\nsee `the exception chaining tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#exception-chaining>`_\nfor details.\n\n**b905**: ``zip()`` without an explicit `strict=` parameter set. ``strict=true`` causes the resulting iterator\nto raise a ``valueerror`` if the arguments are exhausted at differing lengths.\n\nexclusions are `itertools.count <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.count>`_, `itertools.cycle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle>`_ and `itertools.repeat <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat>`_ (with times=none) since they are infinite iterators.\n\nthe ``strict=`` argument was added in python 3.10, so don't enable this flag for code that should work on <3.10.\nfor more information: https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/\n\n**b906**: ``visit_`` function with no further call to a ``visit`` function. this is often an error, and will stop the visitor from recursing into the subnodes of a visited node. consider adding a call ``self.generic_visit(node)`` at the end of the function.\nwill only trigger on function names where the part after ``visit_`` is a valid ``ast`` type with a non-empty ``_fields`` attribute.\nthis is meant to be enabled by developers writing visitors using the ``ast`` module, such as flake8 plugin writers.\n\n**b907**: consider replacing ``f\"'{foo}'\"`` with ``f\"{foo!r}\"`` which is both easier to read and will escape quotes inside ``foo`` if that would appear. the check tries to filter out any format specs that are invalid together with ``!r``. if you're using other conversion flags then e.g. ``f\"'{foo!a}'\"`` can be replaced with ``f\"{ascii(foo)!r}\"``. not currently implemented for python<3.8 or ``str.format()`` calls.\n\n**b908**: contexts with exceptions assertions like ``with self.assertraises`` or ``with pytest.raises`` should not have multiple top-level statements. each statement should be in its own context. that way, the test ensures that the exception is raised only in the exact statement where you expect it.\n\n**b950**: line too long. this is a pragmatic equivalent of\n``pycodestyle``'s ``e501``: it considers \"max-line-length\" but only triggers\nwhen the value has been exceeded by **more than 10%**. ``noqa`` and ``type: ignore`` comments are ignored. you will no\nlonger be forced to reformat code due to the closing parenthesis being\none character too far to satisfy the linter. at the same time, if you do\nsignificantly violate the line length, you will receive a message that\nstates what the actual limit is. this is inspired by raymond hettinger's\n`\"beyond pep 8\" talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-bqajzb8m>`_ and\nhighway patrol not stopping you if you drive < 5mph too fast. disable\n``e501`` to avoid duplicate warnings. like ``e501``, this error ignores long shebangs\non the first line and urls or paths that are on their own line::\n\n  #! long shebang ignored\n\n  # https://some-super-long-domain-name.com/with/some/very/long/paths\n  url = (\n      \"https://some-super-long-domain-name.com/with/some/very/long/paths\"\n  )\n\n\nhow to enable opinionated warnings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nto enable bugbear's opinionated checks (``b9xx``), specify an ``--extend-select``\ncommand-line option or ``extend-select=`` option in your config file\n(requires ``flake8 >=4.0``)::\n\n  [flake8]\n  max-line-length = 80\n  max-complexity = 12\n  ...\n  extend-ignore = e501\n  extend-select = b950\n\nsome of bugbear's checks require other ``flake8`` checks disabled - e.g. ``e501`` must\nbe disabled when enabling ``b950``.\n\nif you'd like all optional warnings to be enabled for you (future proof your config!),\nsay ``b9`` instead of ``b950``. you will need ``flake8 >=3.2`` for this feature.\n\nfor ``flake8 <=4.0``, you will need to use the ``--select`` command-line option or\n``select=`` option in your config file. for ``flake8 >=3.0``, this option is a whitelist\n(checks not listed are implicitly disabled), so you have to explicitly specify all\nchecks you want enabled (e.g. ``select = c,e,f,w,b,b950``).\n\nthe ``--extend-ignore`` command-line option and ``extend-ignore=`` config file option\nrequire ``flake8 >=3.6``. for older ``flake8`` versions, the ``--ignore`` and\n``ignore=`` options can be used. using ``ignore`` will override all codes that are\ndisabled by default from all installed linters, so you will need to specify these codes\nin your configuration to silence them. i think this behavior is surprising so bugbear's\nopinionated warnings require explicit selection.\n\n**note:** bugbear's enforcement of explicit opinionated warning selection is deprecated\nand will be removed in a future release. it is recommended to use ``extend-ignore`` and\n``extend-select`` in your ``flake8`` configuration to avoid implicitly altering selected\nand/or ignored codes.\n\nconfiguration\n-------------\n\nthe plugin currently has the following settings:\n\n``extend-immutable-calls``: specify a list of additional immutable calls.\nthis could be useful, when using other libraries that provide more immutable calls,\nbeside those already handled by ``flake8-bugbear``. calls to these method will no longer\nraise a ``b008`` warning.\n\n``classmethod-decorators``: specify a list of decorators to additionally mark a method as a ``classmethod`` as used by b902. default values are ``classmethod, validator, root_validator``, and when an ``@obj.name`` decorator is specified it will match against either ``name`` or ``obj.name``.\nthis functions similarly to how `pep8-naming <https://github.com/pycqa/pep8-naming>` handles it, but with different defaults, and they don't support specifying attributes such that a decorator will never match against a specified value ``obj.name`` even if decorated with ``@obj.name``.\n\nfor example::\n\n  [flake8]\n  max-line-length = 80\n  max-complexity = 12\n  ...\n  extend-immutable-calls = pathlib.path, path\n  classmethod-decorators = myclassmethod, mylibrary.otherclassmethod\n\ntests / lints\n---------------\n\njust run::\n\n    coverage run tests/test_bugbear.py\n\n\nfor linting::\n\n    pre-commit run
