  "description": "# sql server plugin for mlflow\n\nthis repository provides a mlflow plugin that allows users to use sql server as the artifact store for mlflow.\n\n\n## implementation overview\nthis repository contains one python package:\n\n`dbstoreplugin`: this package includes the `dbartifactrepository` class that is used to read and write artifacts from sql databases. this class sets the attribute `is_plugin = true` in order to indicate that the class is an mlflow artifact repository plugin. this package also includes the sqlalchemy database models referenced by `dbartifactrepository`. the package's `setup.py` file defines entrypoints that tell mlflow to automatically associate the `mssql` uris with the `dbartifactrepository` implementation when the `dbstoreplugin` library is installed. the entrypoints are configured as follows:\n\n```\nentry_points={\n    \"mlflow.artifact_repository\": [\n      \"mssql=sqlplugin.store:dbartifactrepository\"\n    ]\n},\n```\n\n## user experience\n\nthe proposed plugin structure and development workflow provide the following experience to the end user:\n\nusers can simply install mlflow with the sql server plugin via `pip install mlflow[sqlserver]` and then use mlflow as normal. the sql server artifact support will be provided automatically using the previously-described setup entrypoints mechanism.\n\n\n",
