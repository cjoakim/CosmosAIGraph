  "description": "# pyoxigraph (oxigraph for python)\n\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyoxigraph)](https://pypi.org/project/pyoxigraph/)\n[![conda](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/pyoxigraph)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyoxigraph)\n![pypi - implementation](https://img.shields.io/pypi/implementation/pyoxigraph)\n![pypi - python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyoxigraph)\n[![actions status](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/actions)\n[![gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/oxigraph/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/oxigraph/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n\npyoxigraph is a graph database library implementing the [sparql](https://www.w3.org/tr/sparql11-overview/) standard.\nit is a python library written on top of [oxigraph](https://crates.io/crates/oxigraph).\n\npyoxigraph offers two stores with [sparql 1.1](https://www.w3.org/tr/sparql11-overview/) capabilities.\none of the store is in-memory, and the other one is disk based.\n\nit also provides a set of utility functions for reading, writing and processing rdf files in\n[turtle](https://www.w3.org/tr/turtle/),\n[trig](https://www.w3.org/tr/trig/),\n[n-triples](https://www.w3.org/tr/n-triples/),\n[n-quads](https://www.w3.org/tr/n-quads/) and\n[rdf/xml](https://www.w3.org/tr/rdf-syntax-grammar/).\n\npyoxigraph is distributed [on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyoxigraph/) and [on conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyoxigraph).\nrun `pip install pyoxigraph` to install it.\n\nthere exists also a small library providing [rdflib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io) stores using pyoxigraph: [oxrdflib](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxrdflib).\n\npyoxigraph documentation is [available on the oxigraph website](https://pyoxigraph.readthedocs.io/).\n\n## build the development version\n\nto build and install the development version of pyoxigraph you need to clone this git repository including submodules (`git clone --recursive https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph.git`)\nand to run `pip install .` in the `python` directory (the one this readme is in).\n\n## help\n\nfeel free to use [github discussions](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/discussions) or [the gitter chat](https://gitter.im/oxigraph/community) to ask questions or talk about oxigraph.\n[bug reports](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/issues) are also very welcome.\n\nif you need advanced support or are willing to pay to get some extra features, feel free to reach out to [tpt](https://github.com/tpt).\n\n## how to contribute\n\npyoxigraph is written in rust using [pyo3](https://github.com/pyo3/pyo3).\n\npyoxigraph is built using [maturin](https://github.com/pyo3/maturin).\nmaturin could be installed using the `pip install 'maturin>=0.9,<0.10'`.\nto install a development version of oxigraph just run `maturin develop` in this readme directory.\n\n### tests\n\nthe python bindings tests are written in python.\nto run them use `python -m unittest` in the `tests` directory.\n\n### docs\n\nthe sphinx documentation can be generated and viewed in the browser using the following command:\n\n```\nsphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html\n```\n\nnote that you will need to have [sphinx-autobuild](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/) installed.\n\nalternatively, you can use `sphinx-build` with python's `http.server` to achieve the same thing.\n\n## license\n\nthis project is licensed under either of\n\n- apache license, version 2.0, ([license-apache](../license-apache) or\n  http://www.apache.org/licenses/license-2.0)\n- mit license ([license-mit](../license-mit) or\n  http://opensource.org/licenses/mit)\n\nat your option.\n\n### contribution\n\nunless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in oxigraph by you, as defined in the apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\n",
