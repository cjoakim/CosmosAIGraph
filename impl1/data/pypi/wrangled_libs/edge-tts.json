  "description": "# edge-tts\n\n`edge-tts` is a python module that allows you to use microsoft edge's online text-to-speech service from within your python code or using the provided `edge-tts` or `edge-playback` command.\n\n## installation\n\nto install it, run the following command:\n\n    $ pip install edge-tts\n\nif you only want to use the `edge-tts` and `edge-playback` commands, it would be better to use pipx:\n\n    $ pipx install edge-tts\n\n## usage\n\n### basic usage\n\nif you want to use the `edge-tts` command, you can simply run it with the following command:\n\n    $ edge-tts --text \"hello, world!\" --write-media hello.mp3 --write-subtitles hello.vtt\n\nif you wish to play it back immediately with subtitles, you could use the `edge-playback` command:\n\n    $ edge-playback --text \"hello, world!\"\n\nnote the above requires the installation of the `mpv` command line player.\n\nall `edge-tts` commands work in `edge-playback` as well.\n\n### changing the voice\n\nif you want to change the language of the speech or more generally, the voice. \n\nyou must first check the available voices with the `--list-voices` option:\n\n    $ edge-tts --list-voices\n    name: microsoft server speech text to speech voice (af-za, adrineural)\n    shortname: af-za-adrineural\n    gender: female\n    locale: af-za\n\n    name: microsoft server speech text to speech voice (am-et, mekdesneural)\n    shortname: am-et-mekdesneural\n    gender: female\n    locale: am-et\n\n    name: microsoft server speech text to speech voice (ar-eg, salmaneural)\n    shortname: ar-eg-salmaneural\n    gender: female\n    locale: ar-eg\n\n    name: microsoft server speech text to speech voice (ar-sa, zariyahneural)\n    shortname: ar-sa-zariyahneural\n    gender: female\n    locale: ar-sa\n\n    ...\n\n    $ edge-tts --voice ar-eg-salmaneural --text \"\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0628\u0627 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0643\u061f\" --write-media hello_in_arabic.mp3 --write-subtitles hello_in_arabic.vtt\n\n### custom ssml\n\nsupport for custom ssml has been removed since 5.0.0 because microsoft has taken the initiative to prevent it from working. you cannot use custom ssml anymore.\n\n### changing rate, volume and pitch\n\nit is possible to make minor changes to the generated speech.\n\n    $ edge-tts --rate=-50% --text \"hello, world!\" --write-media hello_with_rate_halved.mp3 --write-subtitles hello_with_rate_halved.vtt\n    $ edge-tts --volume=-50% --text \"hello, world!\" --write-media hello_with_volume_halved.mp3 --write-subtitles hello_with_volume_halved.vtt\n    $ edge-tts --pitch=-50hz --text \"hello, world!\" --write-media hello_with_pitch_halved.mp3 --write-subtitles hello_with_pitch_halved.vtt\n\nin addition, it is required to use `--rate=-50%` instead of `--rate -50%` (note the lack of an equal sign) otherwise the `-50%` would be interpreted as just another argument.\n\n### note on the `edge-playback` command\n\n`edge-playback` is just a wrapper around `edge-tts` that plays back the generated speech. it takes the same arguments as the `edge-tts` option.\n\n## python module\n\nit is possible to use the `edge-tts` module directly from python. for a list of example applications:\n\n* https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts/blob/master/examples/basic_generation.py\n* https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts/blob/master/examples/dynamic_voice_selection.py\n* https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts/blob/master/examples/basic_audio_streaming.py\n* https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts/blob/master/examples/streaming_with_subtitles.py\n* https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts/blob/master/src/edge_tts/util.py\n* https://github.com/hasscc/hass-edge-tts/blob/main/custom_components/edge_tts/tts.py\n",
