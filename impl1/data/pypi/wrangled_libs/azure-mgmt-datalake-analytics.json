  "description": "microsoft azure sdk for python\n==============================\n\nthis is the microsoft azure data lake analytics management client library.\n\nazure resource manager (arm) is the next generation of management apis that\nreplace the old azure service management (asm).\n\nthis package has been tested with python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.\n\nfor the older azure service management (asm) libraries, see\n`azure-servicemanagement-legacy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy>`__ library.\n\nfor a more complete set of azure libraries, see the `azure <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure>`__ bundle package.\n\n\ncompatibility\n=============\n\n**important**: if you have an earlier version of the azure package\n(version < 1.0), you should uninstall it before installing this package.\n\nyou can check the version using pip:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    pip freeze\n\nif you see azure==0.11.0 (or any version below 1.0), uninstall it first:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    pip uninstall azure\n\n\nusage\n=====\n\nfor code examples, see `data lake analytics management\n<https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/data-lake-analytics>`__\non docs.microsoft.com.\n\n\nprovide feedback\n================\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the\n`issues <https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues>`__\nsection of the project.\n\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nrelease history\n===============\n\n0.6.0 (2018-06-15)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**features**\n\n- catalog_listtablefragments\n- catalog_previewtable\n- catalog_previewtablepartition\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthe general breaking changes described in 0.5.0 for account now applies to job and catalog as well.\n\n0.5.0 (2018-06-14)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**features**\n\n- client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying http session open for performance\n\n**general breaking changes (account only)**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.\n\n- model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. all positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.\n  to keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for python 2 and python 3. python 3 uses the \"*\" syntax for keyword-only arguments.\n- enum types now use the \"str\" mixin (class azureenum(str, enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.\n  while this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:\n  https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others\n  at a glance:\n\n  - \"is\" should not be used at all.\n  - \"format\" will return the string value, where \"%s\" string formatting will return `nameofenum.stringvalue`. format syntax should be prefered.\n\n- new long running operation:\n\n  - return type changes from `msrestazure.azure_operation.azureoperationpoller` to `msrest.polling.lropoller`. external api is the same.\n  - return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.lropoller`, regardless of the optional parameters used.\n  - the behavior has changed when using `raw=true`. instead of returning the initial call result as `clientrawresponse`,\n    without polling, now this returns an lropoller. after polling, the final resource will be returned as a `clientrawresponse`.\n  - new `polling` parameter. the default behavior is `polling=true` which will poll using arm algorithm. when `polling=false`,\n    the response of the initial call will be returned without polling.\n  - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of `msrest.polling.pollingmethod`.\n  - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right away.\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n- compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0\n\n0.4.0 (2018-02-12)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n- the account operations object has been changed from \"account\" to \"accounts\"\n    - e.g., account.get(...) to accounts.get(...)\n- when creating or updating resources (accounts, compute policies, etc.), explicit parameter objects are now required:\n    - account creation:\n        - \"datalakeanalyticsaccount\" to \"createdatalakeanalyticsaccountparameters\"\n            - list of \"datalakestoreinfo\" to \"adddatalakestorewithaccountparameters\"\n            - list of \"storageaccountinfo\" to \"addstorageaccountwithaccountparameters\"\n            - list of \"firewallrule\" to \"createfirewallrulewithaccountparameters\"\n            - list of \"computepolicy\" to \"createcomputepolicywithaccountparameters\"\n    - account update:\n        - \"datalakeanalyticsupdateparameters\" to \"updatedatalakeanalyticsparameters\"\n            - list of \"datalakestoreinfo\" to \"updatedatalakestorewithaccountparameters\"\n            - list of \"storageaccountinfo\" to \"updatestorageaccountwithaccountparameters\"\n            - list of \"firewallrule\" to \"updatefirewallrulewithaccountparameters\"\n            - list of \"computepolicy\" to \"updatecomputepolicywithaccountparameters\"\n    - data lake store account addition:\n        - \"datalakestoreaccountinfo\" to \"adddatalakestoreparameters\"\n    - storage account addition and update:\n        - \"storageaccountinfo\" to \"addstorageaccountparameters\"\n        - \"storageaccountinfo\" to \"updatestorageaccountparameters\"\n    - compute policy creation and update:\n        - \"computepolicy\" to \"createorupdatecomputepolicyparameters\"\n        - \"computepolicy\" to \"updatecomputepolicyparameters\"\n    - firewall rule creation and update:\n        - \"firewallrule\" to \"createorupdatefirewallruleparameters\"\n        - \"firewallrule\" to \"updatefirewallruleparameters\"\n- when retrieving resources, all the properties are now read-only and the following object names have been changed:\n    - changed \"datalakestoreaccountinfo\" to \"datalakestoreaccountinformation\"\n    - changed \"storageaccountinfo\" to \"storageaccountinformation\"\n- added paging extension for the returned list for these apis:\n    - catalog_listaclsbydatabase\n    - catalog_listacls\n\n0.3.0 (2018-01-09)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n* changed the odataquery parameter type from jobinformation to jobinformationbasic for the job_list api\n* changed the odataquery parameter type from datalakeanalyticsaccount to datalakeanalyticsaccountbasic for these apis:\n\n  * account_list\n  * account_listbyresourcegroup\n\n* for usqljobproperties, fixed the property name of totalpausetime to totalpausedtime\n\n**notes**\n\n* added more properties to jobstatisticsvertexstage\n* added two more states to datalakeanalyticsaccountstatus enum: undeleting and canceled\n* added new account apis:\n\n  * account_checknameavailability\n  * location_getcapability\n  * operation_list\n\n* added new catalog apis:\n\n  * catalog_listaclsbydatabase\n  * catalog_listacls\n  * catalog_grantacltodatabase\n  * catalog_revokeaclfromdatabase\n  * catalog_grantacl\n  * catalog_revokeacl\n\n0.2.0 (2017-08-17)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n* revised the inheritance structure for objects dealing with job creation, building, and retrieving.\n\n  * note: only u-sql is supported in this change; therefore, hive is not supported.\n  * when submitting jobs, change jobinformation objects to createjobparameters.\n\n    * when setting the properties for the createjobparameters object, be sure to change the usqljobproperties object to a createusqljobproperties object.\n\n  * when building jobs, change jobinformation objects to buildjobparameters objects.\n\n    * when setting the properties for the buildjobparameters object, be sure to change the usqljobproperties object to a createusqljobproperties object.\n    * note: the following fields are not a part of the buildjobparameters object:\n\n      * degreeofparallelism\n      * priority\n      * related\n\n  * when getting a list of jobs, the object type that is returned is jobinformationbasic and not jobinformation (more information on the difference is below in the notes section)\n\n* when getting a list of accounts, the object type that is returned is datalakeanalyticsaccountbasic and not datalakeanalyticsaccount (more information on the difference is below in the notes section)\n\n**notes**\n\n* when getting a list of jobs, the job information for each job now includes a strict subset of the job information that is returned when getting a single job\n\n  * the following fields are included in the job information when getting a single job but are not included in the job information when getting a list of jobs:\n\n    * errormessage\n    * stateauditrecords\n    * properties\n\n      * runtimeversion\n      * script\n      * type\n\n* when getting a list of accounts, the account information for each account now includes a strict subset of the account information that is returned when getting a single account\n\n  * there are two ways to get a list of accounts: list and listbyresource methods\n  * the following fields are included in the account information when getting a list of accounts, which is less than the account information retrieved for a single account:\n\n    * provisioningstate\n    * state\n    * creationtime\n    * lastmodifiedtime\n    * endpoint\n\n* when retrieving account information, an account id field called \"accountid\" is now included.\n\n  * accountid's description: the unique identifier associated with this data lake analytics account.\n\n0.1.6 (2017-06-19)\n++++++++++++++++++\n* fixing a regression discovered in 0.1.5. please update to 0.1.6 to avoid any issues caused by that regression.\n\n0.1.5 (2017-06-07)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**new features**\n\n  * support for compute policies on accounts. these will limit specific user and groups to certain job parallelism and priority.\n  * support for job relationship properties. these can be populated in the `related` property when submitting a job and can be retrieved with the `pipeline` and `recurrence` operation methods.\n  * suport for a basic option when listing catalog tables. when set to true, will only return the table name, schema name, database name and version for each table in the list, instead of all table metadata, improving performance when all information is not required.\n\n0.1.4 (2017-04-20)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**new features**\n\n  * catalog item get and list support for packages\n  * update to allow listing certain catalog items from within a database (no schema required to list):\n\n    * list_tables_by_database\n    * list_table_valued_functions_by_database\n    * list_views_by_database\n    * list_table_statistics_by_database\n    * list_table_statistics_by_database_and_schema\n\n**notes**\n\n* this wheel package is now built with the azure wheel extension\n\n0.1.3 (2017-02-13)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**new features**\n\n* add support for firewall rules\n\n  * add, update, get, list and delete operations\n  * enable/disable the firewall\n  *\tallow/block azure ips\n\n*\tremove minimum value requirement from degreeofparallelism. if a value <= 0 is passed in, it will be defaulted automatically to 1.\n*\tremove unused errordetails object\n\n0.1.2 (2017-01-09)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**new features**\n\n* added the ability to create and update accounts with usage commitment levels for data lake store and data lake analytics\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n* fixed a bug where three job diagnostic severity types were missing: severewarning, userwarning and deprecated\n* fixed a bug where updatesecret, which is deprecated, was incorrectly indicating that it had a return type. it now properly does not have a return value.\n\n0.1.1 (2016-12-12)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**new features**\n\n* add cascade query parameter to deletecredential, which allows the user to indicate if they want to delete all resources dependent on the credential as well as the credential\n* parameters are now optional when adding adls accounts to an adla account\n* fixed a bug in adla where the caller could not create an adla account with wasb storage accounts.\n* remove invalid return type from secret creation in adla\n\n**breaking change**\n\n* \"account_name\" parameter is now \"name\" in account operation\n\n\n0.1.0 (2016-11-14)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n* initial release\n\n\n",
