  "description": "base62\n======\n\n|build status| |coveralls| |pypi|\n\na python module for ``base62`` encoding. ported from php code that i wrote\nin mid-2000, which can be found\n`here <http://philosophical.one/posts/base62>`__.\n\n.. |build status| image:: https://github.com/suminb/base62/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/suminb/base62/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3adevelop\n.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pybase62.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybase62\n.. |coveralls| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/suminb/base62/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/suminb/base62?branch=develop\n\n\nrationale\n---------\n\nwhen writing a web application, often times we would like to keep the urls\nshort.\n\n::\n\n    http://localhost/posts/v1biicwt\n\nthis certainly gives a more concise look than the following.\n\n::\n\n    http://localhost/posts/109237591284123\n\nthis was the original motivation to write this module, but there shall be much\nmore broader potential use cases of this module. the main advantage of\n``base62`` is that it is url-safe (as opposed to ``base64``) due to the lack of\nspecial characters such as '``/``' or '``=``'. another key aspect is that the\nalphabetical orders of the original (unencoded) data is preserved when encoded.\nin other words, encoded data can be sorted without being decoded at all.\n\ninstallation\n============\n\n``base62`` can be installed via ``pypi``. unfortunately, the package name\n``base62`` on ``pypi`` had already been occupied by someone else, so we had to\ngo by ``pybase62``.\n\n::\n\n    pip install pybase62\n\nalternatively, you may clone the code to manually install it.\n\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/suminb/base62\n    cd base62 && python setup.py install\n\nusage\n=====\n\nthe following section describes a basic usage of ``base62``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> import base62\n\n    >>> base62.encode(34441886726)\n    'base62'\n\n    >>> base62.decode('base62')\n    34441886726\n\nfrom version ``0.2.0``, ``base62`` supports ``bytes`` array encoding as well.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> base62.encodebytes(b'\\0')\n    0\n\n    >>> base62.encodebytes(b'\\xff\\xff')\n    h31\n\n    >>> base62.decodebytes('0')\n    b''\n\n    >>> base62.decodebytes('1')\n    b'\\x01'\n\nsome may be inclined to assume that they both take ``bytes`` types as input\ndue to their namings. however, ``encodebytes()`` takes ``bytes`` types\nwhereas ``decodebytes()`` takes ``str`` types as an input. they are intended\nto be commutative, so that a *roundtrip* between both functions yields the\noriginal value.\n\nformally speaking, we say function *f* and *g* commute if *f\u2218g* = *g\u2218f* where\n*f(g(x))* = *(f\u2218g)(x)*.\n\ntherefore, we may expect the following relationships:\n\n* ``value == encodebytes(decodebytes(value))``\n* ``value == decodebytes(encodebytes(value))``\n\ntests\n=====\n\nyou may run some test cases to ensure all functionalities are operational.\n\n::\n\n    pytest -v\n\nif ``pytest`` is not installed, you may want to run the following command:\n\n::\n\n    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt\n\n\ndeployment\n==========\n\ndeploy a source package (to `pypi <https://pypi.org>`_) as follows:\n\n::\n\n    python setup.py sdist upload\n",
