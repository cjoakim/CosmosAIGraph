2021-03-05\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* add more useful attributes to log messages, in a key=value format that is easier to extract, and reduce\n  duplicate exception logs.\n* update private.txt file path in developer docs\n\n[3.7.4] - 2021-03-03\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* show \"approved in other course\" status for learner who has a valid verified onboarding attempt in another course,\n  on the instructor's student onboarding status panel\n\n[3.7.3] - 2021-03-02\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* change use of get_active_enrollments_by_course method of the lms enrollments service to\n  get_enrollments_can_take_proctored_exams, which is more performant. this shifts the responsibility\n  of checking learners' ability to access proctored exams to the lms, allowing the lms to construst a\n  bulk query for all learners in a course with active enrollments instead of needing to execute multiple\n  queries on a per learner basis.\n\n[3.7.2] - 2021-03-02\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* refactor the proctoring api function to get all verified onboarding attempts of a group of learners.\n\n[3.7.1] - 2021-03-02\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* update table on instructors dashboard to add accordian for multiple attempts\n\n[3.7.0] -

2021-02-23\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* add a script to generate obscure_user_ids for proctoring vendors to use.\n* update the logic for the instructor dashboard onboarding view to match the learners' view,\n  so that multiple onboarding exams for the same course can be considered.\n\n[3.6.2] -

2021-02-19\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* do not override exam view for a learner taking a practice exam when the learner does\n  not have access to proctoring. this allows the learner to see the exam content and does\n  not allow the learner access to the proctoring software.\n\n[3.5.1] -

2021-02-11\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* add learner onboarding view to instructor dashboard.\n\n[3.2.1] - 2021-02-11\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* bugfix to 500 errors from proctored exam attempt status endpoint used by the lms to drive timer functionality\n\n[3.2.0] -

2021-02-04\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* bug fix for onboarding info panel showing for all proctoring backends, independent of support for onboarding exams\n\n[2.6.6] - 2021-02-01\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* bug fix for issue that prevented exam resets\n\n[2.6.5] -

2021-01-26\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* update the learner onboarding status panel on \"submitted\" state so learner knows they need to wait\n* added npm-shrinkwrap.json to pin the graceful-fs to version 4.2.2 to solve \"primordials\" exception during gulp test\n\n[2.6.2] - 2021-01-25\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* update endpoint that returns onboarding exam status to account for\n  users enrollment mode.\n\n[2.6.1] - 2021-01-25\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* add a dropdown component.\n* if the \"data-enable-exam-resume-proctoring-improvements\" data attribute on the element of the proctoredexamattemptview\n  backbone is true,\n\n  * use the dropdown menu component on the instructor dashboard proctored exam attempt panel for proctored exam attempts in the error state, providing the following options:\n\n    * resume, which transitions the exam attempt into the ready_to_resume state.\n    * reset, which behaves the same as the previous reset functionality, originally exposed via the [x] link.\n  * change the [x] link to reset for exam attempts in other states.\n\n* if the \"data-enable-exam-resume-proctoring-improvements\" data attribute on the element of the proctoredexamattemptview backbone is\n  false there is no change.\n\n[2.6.0] - 2021-01-21\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* replace travis ci with github actions.\n* if a course has a proctoring escalation email set, emails that are sent when an\n  exam attempt is verified or rejected will contain that email address rather than a\n  link to support.\n\n[2.5.13] - 2021-01-20\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* allow staff users to modify another user's exam attempt status via the\n  the studentproctoredexamattempt view's put handler only when the action is\n  \"mark_ready_to_resume\" and the user id is passed in via the request data.\n\n[2.5.12] - 2021-01-20\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* allow blank fields in django admin for `external_id`, `due_date`, and `backend`\n  in proctored exams.\n\n[2.5.11] - 2021-01-19\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* added proctoredexam to django admin\n\n[2.5.10] -

2021-01-08\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* allow the creation of multiple exam attempts for a single user in a single exam, as long\n  as the most recent attempt is `ready_to_resume` or `resumed`. when an exam is resumed, the\n  time remaining is saved to the new attempt and is used to calculate the expiration time.\n\n[2.5.6] - 2021-01-06\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* updated the studentproctoredexamattempt view's put handler to allow for a\n  new action \"mark_ready_to_resume\", which transitions exam attempts in the \"error\" state\n  to a \"ready_to_resume\" state.\n\n[2.5.5] -
