  "description": "# ara records ansible\n\nara records ansible and makes it easier to understand and troubleshoot.\n\n![logo](doc/source/_static/ara-with-icon.png)\n\nit's another recursive acronym and features simplicity as a core principle.\n\n## about ara\n\nara provides ansible reporting by recording ``ansible`` and ``ansible-playbook`` commands wherever and however they are run:\n\n- from a terminal, by hand or from a script\n- from a laptop, desktop, server, vm or container\n- for development, ci or production\n- from most linux distributions and even on mac os (as long as ``python >= 3.8`` is available)\n- from tools that run playbooks such as awx & automation controller (tower), ansible-(pull|test|runner|navigator) and molecule\n- from ci/cd platforms such as jenkins, github actions, gitlab ci, rundeck and zuul\n\n![getting-started](doc/source/_static/getting-started.gif)\n\nin addition to the built-in cli, the data is made available through an included reporting interface as well as a rest api.\n\n![ui-web-demo](doc/source/_static/ui-web-demo.gif)\n\n*note: open the above gifs in a new tab (or window) if the resolution is too small*\n\n## how it works\n\nara records results to sqlite, mysql and postgresql databases with a standard [ansible callback plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/callback.html).\n\nthe callback plugin leverages built-in python api clients to send data to a rest api server:\n\n![recording-workflow](doc/source/_static/graphs/recording-workflow.png)\n\n## requirements\n\n- any recent linux distribution or mac os with python >=3.8 available\n- the ara package (containing the ansible plugins) must be installed for the same python interpreter as ansible itself\n\n## getting started\n\nrunning an api server is not required to get started and it is designed to be simple to record data to a local sqlite database.\n\nfor production use, it is strongly encouraged to:\n\n- [enable authentication for the web interface and api](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-security.html#authentication) to avoid unintentionally leaking passwords, tokens, secrets or otherwise sensitive information that ara might come across and record\n- [configure the callback plugin to ignore sensitive files, host facts and cli arguments (such as extra vars)](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible-plugins-and-use-cases.html#ansible-plugins)\n- learn about the [best practices to improve playbook recording performance](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#improving-playbook-recording-performance)\n\n### recording playbooks without an api server\n\n```bash\n# install ansible (or ansible-core) with ara (including api server dependencies)\npython3 -m pip install --user ansible \"ara[server]\"\n\n# configure ansible to use the ara callback plugin\nexport ansible_callback_plugins=\"$(python3 -m ara.setup.callback_plugins)\"\n\n# run an ansible playbook as usual\nansible-playbook hello-world.yml\n\n# use the cli to see recorded playbooks\nara playbook list\n\n# start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000\n# to query the api or browse recorded results\nara-manage runserver\n```\n\n### recording playbooks with an api server\n\nit is possible to get started with the [ara_api role](https://github.com/ansible-community/ara-collection/blob/master/roles/ara_api/readme.md)\nor with the [container images](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/container-images.html) published by the project on\n[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/recordsansible/ara-api) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/recordsansible/ara-api):\n\n```bash\n# create a directory for a volume to store settings and a sqlite database\nmkdir -p ~/.ara/server\n\n# start an api server with docker from the image on dockerhub:\ndocker run --name api-server --detach --tty \\\n  --volume ~/.ara/server:/opt/ara -p 8000:8000 \\\n  docker.io/recordsansible/ara-api:latest\n\n# or with podman from the image on quay.io:\npodman run --name api-server --detach --tty \\\n  --volume ~/.ara/server:/opt/ara -p 8000:8000 \\\n  quay.io/recordsansible/ara-api:latest\n```\n\nonce the server is running, ara's ansible callback plugin must be installed and configured to send data to it:\n\n```bash\n# install ansible (or ansible-core) with ara (excluding api server dependencies)\npython3 -m pip install --user ansible ara\n\n# configure ansible to use the ara callback plugin\nexport ansible_callback_plugins=\"$(python3 -m ara.setup.callback_plugins)\"\n\n# set up the ara callback to know where the api server is located\nexport ara_api_client=\"http\"\nexport ara_api_server=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000\"\n\n# run an ansible playbook as usual\nansible-playbook playbook.yaml\n\n# use the cli to see recorded playbooks\nara playbook list\n\n# browse http://127.0.0.1:8000 (running from the container)\n# to view the reporting interface\n```\n\ndata will be available on the api server in real time as the playbook progresses and completes.\n\n## live demo\n\na live demo is deployed with the ara ansible collection from [ansible galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/recordsansible/ara).\n\nit is available at https://demo.recordsansible.org.\n\n## documentation and changelog\n\ndocumentation for installing, configuring, running and using ara is available on [ara.readthedocs.io](https://ara.readthedocs.io).\n\ncommon issues may be resolved by reading the [troubleshooting guide](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html).\n\nchangelog and release notes are available within the repository's [git tags](https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/tags) as well as the [documentation](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog-release-notes.html).\n\n## community and getting help\n\n- bugs, issues and enhancements:
