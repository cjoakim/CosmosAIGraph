  "description": "\na high performance, concurrent http client library for python using gevent.\n\ngevent.httplib support was removed in gevent 1.0, geventhttpclient now\nprovides that missing functionality.\n\ngeventhttpclient uses a fast http parser, written in c, originating from\nnginx, extracted and modified by joyent.\n\ngeventhttpclient has been specifically designed for high concurrency,\nstreaming and support http 1.1 persistent connections. more generally it is\ndesigned for efficiently pulling from rest apis and streaming apis\nlike twitter's.\n\nsafe ssl support is provided by default. geventhttpclient depends on\nthe certifi ca bundle. this is the same ca bundle which ships with the\nrequests codebase, and is derived from mozilla firefox's canonical set.\n\nas of 1.5, only python 3.6+ is fully supported (with prebuilt wheels), \nbut python 2.7 and 3.5 *should* work too.\n\nuse of ssl/tls with python 2.7.9 is not recommended and may be broken.\n",
