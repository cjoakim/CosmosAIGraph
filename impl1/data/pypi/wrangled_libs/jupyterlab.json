extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the\njupyter notebook and architecture.\n\n[jupyterlab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-generation user interface for [project jupyter](https://jupyter.org) offering\nall the familiar building blocks of the classic jupyter notebook (notebook,\nterminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and\npowerful user interface.\n\njupyterlab can be extended using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages\nthat use our public apis. the _prebuilt_ extensions can be distributed\nvia [pypi](https://pypi.org/search/?q=jupyterlab&o=-created&c=framework+%3a%3a+jupyter),\nconda, and other package managers. the _source_ extensions can be installed\ndirectly from npm (search for [jupyterlab-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension)) but require an additional build step.\nyou can also find jupyterlab extensions exploring github topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension).\nto learn more about extensions, see the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html).\n\nread the current jupyterlab documentation on [readthedocs](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\n---\n\n## getting started\n\n### installation\n\nif you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html), you can install jupyterlab with one of the following commands.\n\n- if you use conda:\n  ```shell\n  conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\n  ```\n- if you use mamba:\n  ```shell\n  mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\n  ```\n- if you use pip:\n  ```shell\n  pip install jupyterlab\n  ```\n  if installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin` directory to your `path` environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`. if you are using a unix derivative (e.g., freebsd, gnu/linux, macos), you can do this by running `export path=\"$home/.local/bin:$path\"`. if you are using a macos version that comes with python 2, run `pip3` instead of `pip`.\n\nfor more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html). project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the [contributor documentation](contributing.md).\n\n#### installing with previous versions of jupyter notebook\n\nwhen using a version of jupyter notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run after installing jupyterlab to enable the jupyterlab server extension:\n\n```bash\njupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix\n```\n\n### running\n\nstart up jupyterlab using:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab\n```\n\njupyterlab will open automatically in the browser. see the [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) for additional details.\n\nif you encounter an error like \"command 'jupyter' not found\", please make sure `path` environment variable is set correctly. alternatively, you can start up jupyterlab using `~/.local/bin/jupyter lab` without changing the `path` environment variable.\n\n### prerequisites and supported browsers\n\nthe latest versions of the following browsers are currently _known to work_:\n\n- firefox\n- chrome\n- safari\n\nsee our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for additional details.\n\n---\n\n## getting help\n\nwe encourage you to ask questions on the [discourse forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterlab). a question answered there can become a useful resource for others.\n\n### bug report\n\nto report a bug please read the [guidelines](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/issue.html) and then open a [github issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?labels=bug%2c+status%3aneeds+triage&template=bug_report.md). to keep resolved issues self-contained, the [lock bot](https://github.com/apps/lock) will lock closed issues as resolved after a period of inactivity. if a related discussion is still needed after an issue is locked, please open a new issue and reference the old issue.\n\n### feature request\n\nwe also welcome suggestions for new features as they help make the project more useful for everyone. to request a feature please use the [feature request template](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?labels=enhancement%2c+status%3aneeds+triage&template=feature_request.md).\n\n---\n\n## development\n\n### extending jupyterlab\n\nto start developing an extension for jupyterlab, see the [developer documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extension/extension_dev.html) and the [api docs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/).\n\n### contributing\n\nto contribute code or documentation to jupyterlab itself, please read the [contributor documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/contributing.html).\n\njupyterlab follows the jupyter [community guides](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).\n\n### license\n\njupyterlab uses a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the\ncopyright
