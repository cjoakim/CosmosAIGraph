  "description": "## clickhouse connect\n\na high performance core database driver for connecting clickhouse to python, pandas, and superset\n* pandas dataframes\n* numpy arrays\n* pyarrow tables\n* superset connector\n* sqlalchemy 1.3 and 1.4 (limited feature set)\n\nclickhouse connect currently uses the clickhouse http interface for maximum compatibility.  \n\n\n### installation\n\n```\npip install clickhouse-connect\n```\n\nclickhouse connect requires python 3.7 or higher. \n\n\n### superset connectivity\nclickhouse connect is fully integrated with apache superset.  previous versions of clickhouse connect utilized a\ndynamically loaded superset engine spec, but as of superset v2.1.0 the engine spec was incorporated into the main\napache superset project and removed from clickhouse-connect in v0.6.0.  if you have issues connecting to earlier\nversions of superset, please use clickhouse-connect v0.5.25.\n\nwhen creating a superset data source, either use the provided connection dialog, or a sqlalchemy dsn in the form\n`clickhousedb://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}`.\n\n\n### sqlalchemy implementation\nclickhouse connect incorporates a minimal sqlalchemy implementation (without any orm features) for compatibility with\nsuperset.  it has only been tested against sqlalchemy versions 1.3.x and 1.4.x, and is unlikely to work with more\ncomplex sqlalchemy applications.\n\n\n### complete documentation\nthe documentation for clickhouse connect has moved to\n[clickhouse docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/language-clients/python/intro) \n\n\n \n",
