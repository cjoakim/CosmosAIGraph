  "description": "tensorflow-gpu has been removed. please install tensorflow instead.\nthe tensorflow package supports gpu accelerated operations via nvidia cuda.\n\n## removal information\n\ntensorflow and tensorflow-gpu have been the same package since tensorflow\n2.1, released in september 2019. although the checksums differ due to metadata,\nthey were built in the same way and both provide gpu support via nvidia cuda.\nas of december 2022, tensorflow-gpu has been removed and has been replaced with\nthis new, empty package that generates an error upon installation.\n\nall existing versions of tensorflow-gpu are still available, but the\ntensorflow team has stopped releasing any new tensorflow-gpu packages, and\nwill not release any patches for existing tensorflow-gpu versions.\n\n## about this package\n\nthis simple package raises a warning if setup.py is executed as part of a\npackage installation. this intentionally prevents users from installing\nthe package.\n\nto build and upload this package's source distribution (sdist) to testpypi:\n\n```\n$ vim setup.cfg  # update the version number and package name\n$ python3 -m pip install --user twine\n$ python3 setup.py sdist\n$ twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*\n$ pip3 install the_name_of_your_test_package -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple\n```\n",
