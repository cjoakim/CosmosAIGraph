  "description": "pyxlsb2\n=======\n\n``pyxlsb2`` (a variant of pyxlsb - https://github.com/wwwiiilll/pyxlsb) is an excel 2007+ binary workbook (xlsb) parser written in python.\n\n``pyxslb2`` offers the following improvements/changes in comparison to pyxlsb:\n\n1. by default, keeps all data in memory instead of creating temporary files. this is mainly to speed up the processing and also not changing the local filesystem during the processing.\n2. relies on both \"xl\\\\workbook.bin\" and \"xl\\\\_rels\\\\workbook.bin.rels\" to load locate boundsheets. as a result, it can load all worksheets as well as all macrosheets.\n3. extracts macro formulas:\n\n * accurately shows the formulas\n * supports a1 addressing\n * supports external addressing (partially implemented))\n\n4. extracts defined names such as auto_open\n\n\n\ninstall\n-------\n\n1. installing the whl file\n\n download \\.whl file from the release section\n\n     pip install -u [path to whl file]\n\n2. installing the latest development\n \n using pip\n \n     pip install -u https://github.com/dissectmalware/pyxlsb2/archive/master.zip\n\n or download the latest version\n\n     wget https://github.com/dissectmalware/pyxlsb2/archive/master.zip\n\n extract the zip file and go to the extracted directory\n\n     python setup.py install --user\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nthe module exposes an ``open_workbook(name)`` method (similar to xlrd and\nopenpyxl) for opening xlsb files. the workbook object representing the file is\nreturned.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   from pyxlsb2 import open_workbook\n   with open_workbook('book1.xlsb') as wb:\n       # do stuff with wb\n\nthe workbook object exposes a ``get_sheet_by_index(idx)`` and\n``get_sheet_by_name(name)`` method to retrieve worksheet instances.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   # using the sheet index (0-based, unlike vba)\n   with wb.get_sheet_by_index(0) as sheet:\n       # do stuff with sheet\n\n   # using the sheet name\n   with wb.get_sheet_by_name('sheet1') as sheet:\n       # do stuff with sheet\n\na ``sheets`` property containing the sheet names is available on the workbook\ninstance.\n\nthe ``rows()`` method will hand out an iterator to read the worksheet rows. the\nworksheet object is also directly iterable and is equivalent to calling\n``rows()``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   # you can use .rows(sparse=false) to include empty rows\n   for row in sheet.rows():\n       print(row)\n   # [cell(r=0, c=0, v='text'), cell(r=0, c=1, v=42.1337)]\n\n*note*: iterating the same worksheet instance multiple times in parallel (nested\n``for`` for instance) will yield unexpected results, retrieve more instances\ninstead.\n\nnote that dates will appear as floats. you must use the ``convert_date(date)``\nmethod from the corresponding workbook instance to turn them into ``datetime``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   print(wb.convert_date(41235.45578))\n   # datetime.datetime(2012, 11, 22, 10, 56, 19)\n\n\nexample\n-------\n\nconverting a workbook to csv:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   import csv\n   from pyxlsb2 import open_workbook\n\n   with open_workbook('book1.xlsb') as wb:\n       for name in wb.sheets:\n           with wb.get_sheet_by_name(name) as sheet:\n               with open(name + '.csv', 'w') as f:\n                   writer = csv.writer(f)\n                   for row in sheet.rows():\n                       writer.writerow([c.v for c in row])\n\nlimitations\n-----------\n\nnon exhaustive list of things that are currently not supported:\n\n-  style and formatting *wip*\n-  rich text cells (formatting is lost, but getting the text works)\n-  encrypted (password protected) workbooks\n-  comments and other annotations\n-  writing (out of scope)\n\n\n\n\n",
