![voila](docs/source/voila-logo.svg)\n\n[![documentation](http://readthedocs.org/projects/voila/badge/?version=latest)](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n[![binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/voila-dashboards/voila/stable?urlpath=voila%2ftree%2fnotebooks)\n[![join the gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/join%20chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/quantstack/lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nrendering of live jupyter notebooks with interactive widgets.\n\n## introduction\n\nvoil\u00e0 turns jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications.\n\nunlike the usual html-converted notebooks, each user connecting to the voil\u00e0\ntornado application gets a dedicated jupyter kernel which can execute the\ncallbacks to changes in jupyter interactive widgets.\n\n- by default, voil\u00e0 disallows execute requests from the front-end, preventing\n  execution of arbitrary code.\n- by default, voil\u00e0 runs with the `strip_sources` option, which strips out the\n  input cells from the rendered notebook.\n\n## installation\n\nvoil\u00e0 can be installed with the mamba (or conda) package manager from conda-forge\n\n```\nmamba install -c conda-forge voila\n```\n\nor from pypi\n\n```\npip install voila\n```\n\n### jupyterlab preview extension\n\nvoil\u00e0 provides a jupyterlab extension that displays a voil\u00e0 preview of your notebook in a side-pane.\n\nstarting with jupyterlab 3.0, the extension is **automatically installed** after installing `voila`\nwith `pip install voila`.\n\nif you would like to install the extension from source, run the following command.\n\n```\njupyter labextension install @voila-dashboards/jupyterlab-preview\n```\n\n## usage\n\n### as a standalone tornado application\n\nto render the `bqplot` example notebook as a standalone app, run\n`voila bqplot.ipynb`.\nto serve a directory of jupyter notebooks, run `voila` with no argument.\n\nfor example, to render the example notebook `bqplot.ipynb` from this repository with voil\u00e0, you can first update your current environment with the requirements of this notebook (in this case in a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) and render the notebook with\n\n```\nmamba env update -f .binder/environment.yml\ncd notebooks/\nvoila bqplot.ipynb\n```\n\nfor more command line options (e.g., to specify an alternate port number),\nrun `voila --help`.\n\n### as a server extension to `notebook` or `jupyter_server`\n\nvoil\u00e0 can also be used as a jupyter server extension, both with the\n[notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) server or with\n[jupyter_server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server).\n\nto install the jupyter server extension, run\n\n```\njupyter serverextension enable voila\njupyter server extension enable voila\n```\n\nwhen running the jupyter server, the voil\u00e0 app is accessible from the base url\nsuffixed with `voila`.\n\n## documentation\n\nto get started with using voil\u00e0, check out the full documentation:\n\nhttps://voila.readthedocs.io/\n\n## examples\n\nthe following two examples show how a standalone jupyter notebook can be turned into a separate app, from the command-line integration.\n\n### rendering a notebook including interactive widgets and rich mime-type rendering\n\n![voil\u00e0 basics](voila-basics.gif)\n\n### rendering a notebook making use of a custom widget library ([bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot))\n\n![voil\u00e0 bqplot](voila-bqplot.gif)\n\n### showing the source code for a voil\u00e0 notebook\n\nthe sources of the jupyter notebook can be displayed in a voil\u00e0 app if option `strip_sources` is set to `false`.\n\n![voil\u00e0 sources](voila-sources.gif)\n\n### voil\u00e0 dashboards with other language kernels\\*\\*\n\nvoil\u00e0 is built upon jupyter standard formats and protocols, and is agnostic to the programming language of the notebook. in this example, we present an example of a voil\u00e0 application powered by the c++ jupyter kernel [xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling), and the [xleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xleaflet) project.\n\n![voil\u00e0 cling](voila-cling.gif)\n\n## the voil\u00e0 gallery\n\nthe [voil\u00e0 gallery](https://voila-gallery.org) is a collection of live dashboards and applications built with voil\u00e0 and jupyter widgets.\n\nmost of the examples rely on widget libraries such as ipywidgets, ipyleaflet, ipyvolume, bqplot and ipympl, and showcase how to build complex web applications entirely based on notebooks.\n\nnew examples can be added to the gallery by following the steps listed in the [voila-gallery/gallery](https://github.com/voila-gallery/gallery) repository.\n\n## development\n\nsee [contributing.md](./contributing.md) to know how to contribute and set up a development environment.\n\n## related projects\n\nvoil\u00e0 depends on [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) and\n[jupyter_server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/).\n\n## license\n\nwe use a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the\ncopyright on their
