install:\n---------------------\n\nthe recommended way to download and install/update the **latest stable\nrelease** of oletools is to use\n`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__:\n\n-  on linux/mac: ``sudo -h pip install -u oletools[full]``\n-  on windows: ``pip install -u oletools[full]``\n\nthis should automatically create command-line scripts to run each tool\nfrom any directory: ``olevba``, ``mraptor``, ``rtfobj``, etc.\n\nthe keyword ``[full]`` means that all optional dependencies will be\ninstalled, such as xlmmacrodeobfuscator. if you prefer a lighter version\nwithout optional dependencies, just remove ``[full]`` from the command\nline.\n\nto get the **latest development version** instead:\n\n-  on linux/mac:\n   ``sudo -h pip install -u https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip``\n-  on windows:\n   ``pip install -u https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip``\n\nsee the\n`documentation <https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/install>`__\nfor other installation options.\n\ndocumentation:\n--------------\n\nthe latest version of the documentation can be found\n`online <https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki>`__, otherwise a\ncopy is provided in the doc subfolder of the package.\n\nhow to suggest improvements, report issues or contribute:\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nthis is a personal open-source project, developed on my spare time. any\ncontribution, suggestion, feedback or bug report is welcome.\n\nto suggest improvements, report a bug or any issue, please use the\n`issue reporting page <https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/issues>`__,\nproviding all the information and files to reproduce the problem.\n\nyou may also `contact the author <http://decalage.info/contact>`__\ndirectly to provide feedback.\n\nthe code is available in `a github\nrepository <https://github.com/decalage2/oletools>`__. you may use it to\nsubmit enhancements using forks and pull requests.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nthis license applies to the python-oletools package, apart from
