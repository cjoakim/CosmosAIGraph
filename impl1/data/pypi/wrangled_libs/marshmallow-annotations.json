  "description": "=======================\nmarshmallow-annotations\n=======================\n\nmarshmallow-annotations allows you to create marshmallow schema from classes\nwith annotations on them\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from marshmallow_annotations import annotationschema\n    from .music import album, artist\n\n    class albumscheme(annotationschema):\n        class meta:\n            target = album\n            register_as_scheme = true\n\n\n    class artistscheme(annotationschema):\n        class meta:\n            target = artist\n            register_as_scheme = true\n\n\n    scheme = artistscheme()\n    scheme.dump(\n        artist(\n            id=1, name=\"abominable putridity\",\n            albums=[\n                album(\n                    id=1,\n                    name=\"the anomalies of artificial origin\"\n                )\n            ]\n        )\n    )\n\n    # {\n    #     \"albums\": [\n    #         {\n    #             \"id\": 1,\n    #             \"name\": \"the anomalies of artificial origin\"\n    #         }\n    #     ],\n    #     \"id\": 1,\n    #     \"name\": \"abominable putridity\"\n    # }\n\n************\ninstallation\n************\n\n\nmarshmallow-annotations is available on `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/marshmallow-annotations/>`_\nand installable with::\n\n    pip install marshmallow-annotations\n\nmarshmallow-annotations supports python 3.6+ and marshmallow 2.x.x\n\n\n.. note::\n\n    if you are install ``marshmallow-annotations`` outside of a virtual\n    environment, consider installing with\n    ``pip install --user marshmallow-annotations`` rather than using sudo or\n    adminstrator privileges to avoid installing it into your system python.\n\n\nwhy?\n====\n\nkeeping up with entity definitions, orm mappings and schema shapes can be a huge\npain the butt. if you change one thing, you need to change three things.\n\ninstead, marshmallow-annotations wants to drive schema shapes from your\nentity defintions (with a little help from you of course).\n\n\nmore information\n----------------\n\n- for more information, `please visit the documentation <http://marshmallow-annotations.readthedocs.io>`_.\n- found a bug, have a question, or want to request a feature? here is our `issue tracker <https://github.com/justanr/marshmallow-annotations/issues>`_.\n- need the source code? here is the `repository <https://github.com/justanr/marshmallow-annotations>`_\n\n\n",
