(convert it to html first and let firefox's tag-soup parser sort out the invalidity, or use serializedomasscript.)\n\n\n### command line syntax\n\n    pip install lithium-reducer\n    python -m lithium [options] interestingness-test.py [arguments for interestingness test]\n\n\n### command line options\n\n<dl>\n\n<dt>--testcase=filename</dt>\n<dd>tells lithium which file to reduce.  by default, it will assume the last argument to the interestingness test is the file to reduce.</dd>\n\n<dt>--char (-c)<dt>\n<dd>by default, lithium treats lines as atomic units.  this is great if each line is a javascript statement, but sometimes you want to go further.  use this option to tell lithium to treat the file as a sequence of characters instead of a sequence of lines.</dd>\n\n<dt>--strategy=[check-only,minimize,minimize-balanced,replace-properties-by-globals,replace-arguments-by-globals,minimize-around]</dt>\n<dd>\"minimize\" is the default, the algorithm described above. \"check-only\" tries to run lithium to determine interestingness, without reduction. for the other strategies, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/mozillasecurity/lithium/pull/2\">this github pr</a>.</dd>\n\n<dt>--repeat=[always, last, never].</dt>\n<dd>by default, lithium only repeats at the same chunk size if it just finished the last round (e.g. chunk size 1).  you can use --repeat=always to tell it to repeat any chunk size if something was removed during the round, which can be useful for non-deterministic testcases or non-monotonic situations.  you can use --repeat=never to tell it to exit immediately after a single round at the last chunk size, which can save a little time at the risk of leaving a little bit extra in the file.</dd>\n\n<dt>--max=n. default: about half of the file.</dt>\n<dt>--min=n. default: 1.</dt>\n<dd>what chunk sizes to test.  must be powers of two.  --max is useful if you're restarting lithium after it has already gone through a few rounds.  --min is useful if you're reducing html and want to do the final by hand.</dd>\n\n<dt>--chunk-size=n</dt>\n<dd>shortcut for \"repeat=never, min=n, max=n\".  --chunk-size=1 is a quick way to determine whether a file is 1-minimal, for example after making a change that you think might make some lines unnecessary.</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n\n### hints\n\nif you find a non-deterministic bug, don't despair.  lithium will do fine as long as you make the bug happen at least 70% of the time.  you can repeat the test either within the application, by adding a loop or reload in the testcase (outside of the ddbegin/ddend markers!), or outside of the application, by adding a loop to the \"interestingness test\" script.\n\n\n### requirements\n\nlithium is written in [python](https://www.python.org/) and requires python 3.5+.\n\n### credits\n\n- [lithium's testcase reduction algorithm](src/lithium/docs/algorithm.md) is a modified version of the \"ddmin\" algorithm in andreas zeller's paper, [simplifying and isolating failure-inducing input](https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/papers/tse2002/).\n- the idea of using an external \"interestingness test\" program came from [delta](http://delta.tigris.org/), a similar tool that's [used in clever ways by the gcc project](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/a_guide_to_testcase_reduction).\n- [timed_run](src/lithium/interestingness/timed_run.py), used by many of the \"interestingness test\" scripts that come with lithium, is based on [timed_run.py](https://web.archive.org/web/20071107032840/http://bclary.com/log/2007/03/07/timed_run), which was written by [chris cooper](http://coop.deadsquid.com/) and [bob clary](https://bclary.com/).\n- the code was significantly cleaned up and modernized by jesse schwartzentruber and gary kwong in mid-2017.\n",
