[read blogpost here](https://s12d.com/5aa6u0o7).\n\n* **speed up development with sam accelerate** - quickly test your changes in the cloud. [read docs here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/accelerate.html).\n\n* **aws serverless developer experience workshop: a day in a life of a developer** - [this advanced workshop](https://s12d.com/aws-sde-workshop) provides you with an immersive experience as a serverless developer, with hands-on experience building a serverless solution using aws sam and sam cli.\n\n* **the complete sam workshop**- [this workshop](https://s12d.com/jko46elk) is a great way to experience the power of sam and sam cli.\n\n* **getting started with ci/cd? sam pipelines can help you get started** - [this workshop](https://s12d.com/_jq48d5t) walks you through the basics.\n\n* **get started with serverless application development using sam cli** - [this workshop](https://s12d.com/tq9ze-br) walks you through the basics.\n\n## get started\n\nto get started with building sam-based applications, use the sam cli. sam cli provides a lambda-like execution\nenvironment that lets you locally build, test, debug, and deploy [aws serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) applications.\n\n* [install sam cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)\n* [build & deploy a \"hello world\" web app](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-quick-start.html)\n* [install aws toolkit](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/#ide_and_ide_toolkits) to use sam with your favorite ides\n* [tutorials and workshops](https://serverlessland.com/learn)\n* **powertools for aws lambda** is a developer toolkit to implement serverless best practices and increase developer velocity. available for [python](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python), [java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-java), [typescript](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript) and [.net](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-dotnet).\n\n**next steps:** learn to build a more complex serverless application.\n\n* [extract text from images and store it in a database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-example-s3.html) using amazon s3 and amazon rekognition services.\n* [detect when records are added to a database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-example-ddb.html) using amazon dynamodb database and asynchronous stream processing.\n* [explore popular patterns](https://serverlessland.com/patterns)\n\n## what is this github repository? \ud83d\udcbb\n\nthis github repository contains source code for sam cli. here is the development team talking about this code:\n\n> sam cli code is written in python. source code is well documented, very modular, with 95% unit test coverage.\nit uses this awesome python library called click to manage the command line interaction and uses docker to run lambda functions locally.\nwe think you'll like the code base. clone it and run `make pr` or `./make -pr` on windows!\n\n## related repositories and resources\n\n* **sam transform** [open source template specification](https://github.com/aws/serverless-application-model/) that provides shorthand syntax for cloudformation\n* **sam cli application templates** get started quickly with [predefined application templates](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli-app-templates/blob/master/readme.md) for all supported runtimes and languages, used by `sam init`\n* **lambda builders** [lambda builder tools](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-builders) for supported runtimes and custom build workflows, used by `sam build`\n* **build and local emulation images for ci/cd tools** [build container images](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sam/) to use with ci/cd tasks\n\n## contribute to sam\n\nwe love our contributors \u2764\ufe0f we have over 100 contributors who have built various parts of the product.\nread this [testimonial from @ndobryanskyy](https://www.lohika.com/aws-sam-my-exciting-first-open-source-experience/) to learn\nmore about what it was like contributing to sam.\n\ndepending on your interest and skill, you can help build the different parts of the sam project;\n\n**enhance the sam specification**\n\nmake pull requests, report bugs, and share ideas to improve the full sam template specification.\nsource code is located on github at [aws/serverless-application-model](https://github.com/aws/serverless-application-model).\nread the [sam specification contributing guide](https://github.com/aws/serverless-application-model/blob/master/contributing.md)\nto get started.\n\n**strengthen sam cli**\n\nadd new commands, enhance existing ones, report bugs, or request new features for the sam cli.\nsource code is located on github at [aws/aws-sam-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli). read the [sam cli contributing guide](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/blob/develop/contributing.md) to\nget started.\n\n**update sam developer guide**\n\n[sam developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/index.html) provides a comprehensive getting started guide and reference documentation.\nsource code is located on github at [awsdocs/aws-sam-developer-guide](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-sam-developer-guide).\nread the [sam documentation contribution guide](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-sam-developer-guide/blob/master/contributing.md) to get\nstarted.\n\n### join the sam community on slack\n\n[join the sam developers channel (#samdev)](https://join.slack.com/t/awsdevelopers/shared_invite/zt-yryddays-c9fkwrmgudv0h2eedzcqvw) on slack to collaborate with fellow community members and the aws sam team.\n",
