  "description": "pytest-black\n============\n\n[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/shopkeep/pytest-black.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shopkeep/pytest-black)\n\na pytest plugin to enable format checking with [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).\n\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\n* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)\n* [black](https://github.com/ambv/black)\n\nthere is a minimum requirement of black 19.3b0 or later.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\n```\n$ pip install pytest-black\n```\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nto run pytest with formatting checks provided by black:\n\n```\n$ pytest --black\n```\n\nthe plugin will output a diff of suggested formatting changes (if any exist). changes will _not_ be applied automatically.\n\n\nconfiguration\n-------------\n\nyou can override default black configuration options by placing a `pyproject.toml` file in your project directory. see example configuration [here](https://github.com/ambv/black/blob/master/pyproject.toml).\n\n\npython package management\n-------------------------\nfor *poetry* to work correctly, include this in your pyproject.toml configuration file:\n\n```\n[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]\n...\nblack = { version = \"*\", allow-prereleases = true }\n...\n```\n\nthis is necessary because at the time of writing all the *black* releases in pypi have been tagged as pre-releases (beta code), which breaks *poetry*'s dependency resolution.\n\n\ntesting\n-------\n\nto run the tests against a selection of python interpreters:\n\n```\n$ tox\n```\n\nto run against a specific interpreter (e.g. python 3.6):\n\n```\n$ tox -e py36\n```\n\nthe `tox.ini` file in the root of this repository is used to configure the test environment.\n\n\nlicense\n-------\n\ndistributed under the terms of the `mit` license, `pytest-black` is free and open source software\n\n\nissues\n------\n\nif you encounter any problems, please [file an issue](https://github.com/shopkeep/pytest-black/issues) along with a detailed description.",
