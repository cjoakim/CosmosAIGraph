  "description": "# google api client\n\n[![pypi version](https://badge.fury.io/py/google-api-python-client.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/google-api-python-client)\n\nthis is the [google api python client library](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained#google_api_client_libraries)\nfor google's discovery based apis. to get started, please see the\n[docs folder](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/docs/readme.md).\n\nthis library is considered complete and is in maintenance mode. this means\nthat we will address critical bugs and security issues but will not add any\nnew features.\n\nthis library is officially supported by google.  however, the maintainers of\nthis repository recommend using [cloud client libraries for python](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python),\nwhere possible, for new code development. for more information, please visit\n[client libraries explained](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained).\n\n## version 2.0 release\nthe 2.0 release of `google-api-python-client` includes a substantial reliability \nimprovement, compared with 1.x, as discovery documents are now cached in the library \nrather than fetched dynamically. it is highly recommended to upgrade from v1.x to v2.x.\n\nonly python 3.7 and newer is supported. if you are not able to upgrade python, then\nplease continue to use version 1.x as we will continue supporting python 2.7+ in\n[v1](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/tree/v1).\n\ndiscovery documents will no longer be retrieved dynamically when\nyou call `discovery.build()`. the discovery documents will instead be retrieved\nfrom the client library directly. new versions of this library are released weekly.\nas a result of caching the discovery documents, the size of this package is at least \n50 mb larger compared to the previous version. \n\nplease see the [migration guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/upgrading.md)\nfor more information.\n\n## documentation\n\nsee the [docs folder](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/docs/readme.md) for more detailed instructions and additional documentation.\n\n## other google api libraries\n\nthe maintainers of this repository recommend using\n[cloud client libraries for python](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python),\nwhere possible, for new code development due to the following reasons:\n\nwith [cloud client libraries for python](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python):\n- there is a separate client library for each api, so you can choose\nwhich client libraries to download. whereas, `google-api-python-client` is a\nsingle client library for all apis. as a result, the total package size for\n`google-api-python-client` exceeds 50mb.\n- there are stricter controls for breaking changes to the underlying apis\nas each client library is focused on a specific api.\n- there are more features in these cloud client libraries as each library is\nfocused on a specific api, and in some cases, the libraries are owned by team\nwho specialized in that api.\n- developers will benefit from intellisense.\n\nfor more information, please visit\n[client libraries explained](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained).\n\nalthough there are many benefits to moving to\n[cloud client libraries for python](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python),\nthe maintainers want to emphasize that `google-api-python-client` will continue\nto be supported.\n\nfor google ads api, we recommend using [google ads api client library for python](https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-python/).\n\nfor google firebase admin api, we recommend using [firebase admin python sdk](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python).\n\n## installation\n\ninstall this library in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) using pip. virtualenv is a tool to\ncreate isolated python environments. the basic problem it addresses is one of\ndependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.\n\nwith virtualenv, it's possible to install this library without needing system\ninstall permissions, and without clashing with the installed system\ndependencies.\n\n### mac/linux\n\n```\npip3 install virtualenv\nvirtualenv <your-env>\nsource <your-env>/bin/activate\n<your-env>/bin/pip install google-api-python-client\n```\n\n### windows\n\n```\npip install virtualenv\nvirtualenv <your-env>\n<your-env>\\scripts\\activate\n<your-env>\\scripts\\pip.exe install google-api-python-client\n```\n\n## supported python versions\n\npython 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 are fully supported and tested. this library may work on later versions of 3, but we do not currently run tests against those versions.\n\n## unsupported python versions\n\npython < 3.7\n\n## third party libraries and dependencies\n\nthe following libraries will be installed when you install the client library:\n* [httplib2](https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2)\n* [uritemplate](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/uritemplate)\n\nfor development you will also need the following libraries:\n* [webtest](https://pypi.org/project/webtest/)\n* [pyopenssl](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyopenssl)\n\n## contributing\n\nplease see our [contribution guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/contributing.rst).\nin particular, we love pull requests - but please make sure to sign\nthe contributor license agreement.\n",
