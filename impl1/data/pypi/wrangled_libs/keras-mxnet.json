  "description": "\nkeras is a high-level neural networks api,\nwritten in python. keras-mxnet is capable of running on top of\nhigh performance, scalable apache mxnet deep learning engine.\n\nuse keras-mxnet if you need a deep learning library that:\n\n- allows for easy and fast prototyping\n  (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).\n- supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks,\n  as well as combinations of the two.\n- runs seamlessly on cpu, one gpu and multi-gpu.\n\nread the keras documentation at: https://keras.io/\n\nread the keras-mxnet documentation at:\nhttps://github.com/awslabs/keras-apache-mxnet/tree/master/docs/mxnet_backend\n\nfor a detailed overview of what makes keras special, see:\nhttps://keras.io/why-use-keras/\nkeras is compatible with python 2.7-3.6\nand is distributed under the mit liense.\n\n\n",
