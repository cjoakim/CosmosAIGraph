  "description": "py-bcrypt is an implementation the openbsd blowfish password hashing\nalgorithm, as described in \"a future-adaptable password scheme\" by \nniels provos and david mazieres and related bcrypt-based key derivation\nfunction implemented in openbsd libutil.\n\nthis system hashes passwords using a version of bruce schneier's\nblowfish block cipher with modifications designed to raise the cost\nof off-line password cracking. the computation cost of the algorithm \nis parametised, so it can be increased as computers get faster.\n\ntwo interfaces are supported: a classic password hashing interface and\na key derivation function (kdf) intended for generating cryptographic\nkeys.",
