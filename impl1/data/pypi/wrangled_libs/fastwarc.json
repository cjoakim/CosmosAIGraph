  "description": "# fastwarc\n\nfastwarc is a high-performance warc parsing library for python written in c++/cython. the api is inspired in large parts by [warcio](https://github.com/webrecorder/warcio), but does not aim at being a drop-in replacement.  fastwarc supports compressed and uncompressed warc/1.0 and warc/1.1 streams. supported compression algorithms are gzip and lz4.\n\nfastwarc belongs to the [chatnoir resiliparse toolkit](https://github.com/chatnoir-eu/chatnoir-resiliparse/) for fast and robust web data processing.\n\n## installing fastwarc\npre-built fastwarc binaries for most linux platforms can be installed from pypi:\n```bash\npip install fastwarc\n```\n**however:** the linux binaries are provided *solely for your convenience*. since they are built on the very old `manylinux` base system for better compatibility, their performance isn't optimal (though still better than warcio). for best performance, see the next section on how to build fastwarc yourself.\n\n## building fastwarc from source\nyou can compile fastwarc either from the pypi source package or directly from this repository, though in any case, you need to install all required build-time dependencies first. on ubuntu, this is done as follows:\n```bash\nsudo apt install build-essential python3-dev zlib1g-dev liblz4-dev\n```\nto build and install fastwarc from pypi, run\n```bash\npip install --no-binary fastwarc fastwarc\n```\nthat's it. if you prefer to build and install directly from this repository instead, run:\n```bash\npip install -e fastwarc\n```\nto build the wheels without installing them, run:\n```bash\npip wheel -e fastwarc\n\n# or:\npip install build && python -m build --wheel fastwarc\n```\n\n## usage instructions\nfor detailed usage instructions, please consult the [fastwarc user manual](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/man/fastwarc.html).\n\n## cite us\nif you use fastwarc, please consider citing our [ossym 2021 abstract paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03103):\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{bevendorff:2021,\n  author =                {janek bevendorff and martin potthast and benno stein},\n  booktitle =             {3rd international symposium on open search technology (ossym 2021)},\n  editor =                {andreas wagner and christian guetl and michael granitzer and stefan voigt},\n  month =                 oct,\n  publisher =             {international open search symposium},\n  site =                  {cern, geneva, switzerland},\n  title =                 {{fastwarc: optimizing large-scale web archive analytics}},\n  year =                  2021\n}\n```\n",
