  "description": "a https client implementation for \n * ``httplib`` (python 2), ``http.client`` (python 3) and \n * ``urllib2`` (python 2) and ``urllib`` (python 3)\n\n... based on pyopenssl.  pyopenssl provides a more fully featured ssl implementation \nover the default provided with python and importantly enables full verification \nof the ssl peer using ``pyasn1``.\n\nreleases\n========\n0.5.1\n-----\n * clean up handling for description file - pull in content from this file into setup()\n * allows the nightly build to fail\n * add trove version classifiers to make it explicit what is supported\n * add python_requires to help pip\n * drop support for eol python 2.6 and 3.3  \n  \nthanks to @hugovk for contributions\n\n0.5.0\n-----\n * fix to subject alternative name handling to allow for certificates with\n   more than 64 names (max now 1024).  thanks to matt pegler\n * fix to subjectaltname string to use byte type for correct matching \n * updated ssl context objects to default to tls 1.2\n\n0.4.4\n-----\n * updated test certificates\n\n0.4.3\n-----\n * fix to ``ndg`` namespace package warning issue (https://github.com/cedadev/ndg_httpsclient/issues/3).  \n   ``__init__.py`` file now included in ``ndg`` directory so that there are no longer warnings with imports\n   when using python 2.x.  thanks to max mauntner for fix.\n * minor fix for installation: set minimum release for ``pyasn1`` to avoid conflicts with ubuntu\n   install - see https://github.com/cedadev/ndg_httpsclient/issues/5 and\n   https://github.com/cedadev/ndg_httpsclient/pull/10.  ``pyasn1`` also becomes mandatory rather\n   than optional package for install.  - it required by ``cryptography`` anyway which is a \n   dependency for ``pyopenssl`` from version 0.14.\n\n0.4.2\n-----\n * fix to bug in ``ndg.httpsclient.utils.open_url`` - duplicate open call.  \n   nb. this bug and the fix do not affect the ``httplib``and ``urllib2`` \n   interfaces that this package provides.\n \n0.4.1\n-----\n * added explicit ref to python 3 in classifier text for python 3 checking tools.\n * moved license file into package\n\n0.4.0\n-----\n * made dual compatible with python 2 / 3.\n \n0.3.3\n-----\n * fix to add in anothername for ``subjectaltnames`` field - added for support for cacert issued\n   certs (thanks to gu1).\n * fix to http basic auth option for ``ndg.httpsclient.utils.main``\n * fix to ``serversslcertverification`` so that it can pass a function-based callback instead of using ``__call__``. in newer versions of openssl (>= 0.14) the latter failed because of a request for ``__name__`` attribute.\n\n0.3.2\n-----\n * fix to subjectaltnames support check - should only be enabled if pyasn1 is \n   installed.\n * fix to open_url: http request object was being created inside if headers is \n   none block - now corrected to create regardless.\n * added http basic auth support to script. (thanks to willem van engen)\n \n0.3.1\n-----\n * extended utils functions to support keyword for passing additional ``urllib2``\n   handlers.\n\n0.3.0\n-----\n * added ``ndg.httpsclient.utils.fetch_stream_from_url`` function and added\n   parameter for data to post in ``open_url`` and ``fetch_*`` methods.\n * fix to ndg.httpsclient.utils module _should_use_proxy and open_url functions\n\n0.2.0\n-----\n * added support for ssl verification with subjectaltnames using pyasn1\n * fixed minor bug - ssl cert dn prefix matching\n\n0.1.0\n-----\ninitial release\n\nprerequisites\n=============\nthis has been developed and tested for python 2.7 with pyopenssl 0.13 \nand 0.14.  version 0.4.0 tested with ``pyopenssl`` 0.15.1 and python 2.7 and \n3.4. \n``pyasn1`` is required for correct ssl verification with ``subjectaltnames``.\n\ninstallation\n============\ninstallation can be performed using ``easy_install`` or ``pip``.\n\nrunning ndg_httpclient\n======================\na simple script for fetching data using http or https get from a specified url.\n\nparameter:\n\n``url``\n  the url of the resource to be fetched\n\noptions:\n\n``-h, --help``\n  show help message and exit.\n\n``-c file, --certificate=file``\n  certificate file - defaults to ``$home/credentials.pem``\n\n``-k file, --private-key=file``\n  private key file - defaults to the certificate file\n\n``-t dir, --ca-certificate-dir=dir``\n  trusted ca certificate file directory.\n\n``-d, --debug``\n  print debug information - this may be useful in solving problems with http or \n  https access to a server.\n    \n``-p file, --post-data-file=file``\n  post data file\n    \n``-f file, --fetch=file``\n  output file\n    \n``-n, --no-verify-peer``\n  skip verification of peer certificate.\n  \n",
