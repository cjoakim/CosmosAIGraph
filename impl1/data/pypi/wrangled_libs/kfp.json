  "description": "kubeflow pipelines is a platform for building and deploying portable, scalable machine learning workflows based on docker containers within the [kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) project.\n\nuse kubeflow pipelines to compose a multi-step workflow ([pipeline](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/pipeline/)) as a [graph](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/graph/) of containerized [tasks](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/step/) using python code and/or yaml. then, [run](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/run/) your pipeline with specified pipeline arguments, rerun your pipeline with new arguments or data, [schedule](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/run-trigger/) your pipeline to run on a recurring basis, organize your runs into [experiments](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/experiment/), save machine learning artifacts to compliant [artifact registries](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/metadata/), and visualize it all through the [kubeflow dashboard](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/overview/).\n\n## installation\n\nto install `kfp`, run:\n\n```sh\npip install kfp\n```\n\n## getting started\n\nthe following is an example of a simple pipeline that uses the `kfp` v2 syntax:\n\n```python\nfrom kfp import dsl\nimport kfp\n\n\n@dsl.component\ndef add(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    '''calculates sum of two arguments'''\n    return a + b\n\n\n@dsl.pipeline(\n    name='addition pipeline',\n    description='an example pipeline that performs addition calculations.')\ndef add_pipeline(\n    a: float = 1.0,\n    b: float = 7.0,\n):\n    first_add_task = add(a=a, b=4.0)\n    second_add_task = add(a=first_add_task.output, b=b)\n\n\nclient = kfp.client(host='<my-host-url>')\nclient.create_run_from_pipeline_func(\n    add_pipeline, arguments={\n        'a': 7.0,\n        'b': 8.0\n    })\n\n```",
