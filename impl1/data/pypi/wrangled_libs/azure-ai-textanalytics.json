  "description": "# azure text analytics client library for python\n\nthe azure cognitive service for language is a cloud-based service that provides natural language processing (nlp) features for understanding and analyzing text, and includes the following main features:\n\n- sentiment analysis\n- named entity recognition\n- language detection\n- key phrase extraction\n- entity linking\n- multiple analysis\n- personally identifiable information (pii) detection\n- text analytics for health\n- custom named entity recognition\n- custom text classification\n- extractive text summarization\n- abstractive text summarization\n\n[source code][source_code]\n| [package (pypi)][ta_pypi]\n| [package (conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-ai-textanalytics/)\n| [api reference documentation][ta_ref_docs]\n| [product documentation][language_product_documentation]\n| [samples][ta_samples]\n\n## getting started\n\n### prerequisites\n\n- python 3.7 later is required to use this package.\n- you must have an [azure subscription][azure_subscription] and a\n  [cognitive services or language service resource][ta_or_cs_resource] to use this package.\n\n#### create a cognitive services or language service resource\n\nthe language service supports both [multi-service and single-service access][multi_and_single_service].\ncreate a cognitive services resource if you plan to access multiple cognitive services under a single endpoint/key. for language service access only, create a language service resource.\nyou can create the resource using the [azure portal][azure_portal_create_ta_resource] or [azure cli][azure_cli] following the steps in [this document][azure_cli_create_ta_resource].\n\ninteraction with the service using the client library begins with a [client](#textanalyticsclient \"textanalyticsclient\").\nto create a client object, you will need the cognitive services or language service `endpoint` to\nyour resource and a `credential` that allows you access:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.core.credentials import azurekeycredential\nfrom azure.ai.textanalytics import textanalyticsclient\n\ncredential = azurekeycredential(\"<api_key>\")\ntext_analytics_client = textanalyticsclient(endpoint=\"https://<resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/\", credential=credential)\n```\n\nnote that for some cognitive services resources the endpoint might look different from the above code snippet.\nfor example, `https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/`.\n\n### install the package\n\ninstall the azure text analytics client library for python with [pip][pip]:\n\n```bash\npip install azure-ai-textanalytics\n```\n\n<!-- snippet:sample_authentication.create_ta_client_with_key -->\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.core.credentials import azurekeycredential\nfrom azure.ai.textanalytics import textanalyticsclient\nendpoint = os.environ[\"azure_language_endpoint\"]\nkey = os.environ[\"azure_language_key\"]\n\ntext_analytics_client = textanalyticsclient(endpoint, azurekeycredential(key))\n```\n\n<!-- end snippet -->\n\n> note that `5.2.x` and newer targets the azure cognitive service for language apis. these apis include the text analysis and natural language processing features found in the previous versions of the text analytics client library.\nin addition, the service api has changed from semantic to date-based versioning. this version of the client library defaults to the latest supported api version, which currently is `2023-04-01`.\n\nthis table shows the relationship between sdk versions and supported api versions of the service\n\n| sdk version  | supported api version of service  |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------- |\n| 5.3.x - latest stable release | 3.0, 3.1, 2022-05-01, 2023-04-01 (default) |\n| 5.2.x  | 3.0, 3.1, 2022-05-01 (default) |\n| 5.1.0  | 3.0, 3.1 (default) |\n| 5.0.0  | 3.0 |\n\napi version can be selected by passing the [api_version][text_analytics_client] keyword argument into the client.\nfor the latest language service features, consider selecting the most recent beta api version. for production scenarios, the latest stable version is recommended. setting to an older version may result in reduced feature compatibility.\n\n### authenticate the client\n\n#### get the endpoint\n\nyou can find the endpoint for your language service resource using the\n[azure portal][azure_portal_get_endpoint]\nor [azure cli][azure_cli_endpoint_lookup]:\n\n```bash\n# get the endpoint for the language service resource\naz cognitiveservices account show --name \"resource-name\" --resource-group \"resource-group-name\" --query \"properties.endpoint\"\n```\n\n#### get the api key\n\nyou can get the [api key][cognitive_authentication_api_key] from the cognitive services or language service resource in the [azure portal][azure_portal_get_endpoint].\nalternatively, you can use [azure cli][azure_cli_endpoint_lookup] snippet below to get the api key of your resource.\n\n`az cognitiveservices account keys list --name \"resource-name\" --resource-group \"resource-group-name\"`\n\n#### create a textanalyticsclient with an api key credential\n\nonce you have the value for the api key, you can pass it as a string into an instance of [azurekeycredential][azure-key-credential]. use the key as the credential parameter\nto authenticate the client:\n\n<!-- snippet:sample_authentication.create_ta_client_with_key -->\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.core.credentials import azurekeycredential\nfrom azure.ai.textanalytics import textanalyticsclient\nendpoint = os.environ[\"azure_language_endpoint\"]\nkey = os.environ[\"azure_language_key\"]\n\ntext_analytics_client = textanalyticsclient(endpoint, azurekeycredential(key))\n```\n\n<!-- end snippet -->\n\n#### create a textanalyticsclient with an azure active directory credential\n\nto use an [azure active directory (aad) token credential][cognitive_authentication_aad],\nprovide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the\n[azure-identity][azure_identity_credentials] library.\nnote that regional endpoints do not support aad authentication. create a [custom subdomain][custom_subdomain]\nname for your resource in order to use this type of authentication.\n\nauthentication with aad requires some initial setup:\n\n- [install azure-identity][install_azure_identity]\n- [register a new aad application][register_aad_app]\n- [grant access][grant_role_access] to the language service by assigning the `\"cognitive services language reader\"` role to your service principal.\n\nafter setup, you can choose which type of [credential][azure_identity_credentials] from azure.identity to use.\nas an example, [defaultazurecredential][default_azure_credential]\ncan be used to authenticate the client:\n\nset the values of the client id, tenant id, and client secret of the aad application as environment variables:\nazure_client_id, azure_tenant_id, azure_client_secret\n\nuse the returned token credential to authenticate the client:\n\n<!-- snippet:sample_authentication.create_ta_client_with_aad -->\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.ai.textanalytics import textanalyticsclient\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\n\nendpoint = os.environ[\"azure_language_endpoint\"]\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\n\ntext_analytics_client = textanalyticsclient(endpoint, credential=credential)\n```\n\n<!-- end snippet -->\n\n## key concepts\n\n### textanalyticsclient\n\nthe text analytics client library provides a [textanalyticsclient][text_analytics_client] to do analysis on [batches of documents](#examples \"examples\").\nit provides both synchronous and asynchronous operations to access a specific use of text analysis, such as language detection or key phrase extraction.\n\n### input\n\na **document** is a single unit to be analyzed by the predictive models in the language service.\nthe input for each operation is passed as a **list** of documents.\n\neach document can be passed as a string in the list, e.g.\n\n```python\ndocuments = [\"i hated the movie. it was so slow!\", \"the movie made it into my top ten favorites. what a great movie!\"]\n```\n\nor, if you wish to pass in a per-item document `id` or `language`/`country_hint`, they can be passed as a list of\n[detectlanguageinput][detect_language_input] or\n[textdocumentinput][text_document_input]\nor a dict-like representation of the object:\n\n```python\ndocuments = [\n    {\"id\": \"1\", \"language\": \"en\", \"text\": \"i hated the movie. it was so slow!\"},\n    {\"id\": \"2\", \"language\": \"en\", \"text\": \"the movie made it into my top ten favorites. what a great movie!\"},\n]\n```\n\nsee [service limitations][service_limits] for the input, including document length limits, maximum batch size, and supported text encoding.\n\n### return value\n\nthe return value for a single document can be a result or error object.\na heterogeneous list containing a collection of result and error objects is returned from each operation.\nthese results/errors are index-matched with the order of the provided documents.\n\na **result**, such as [analyzesentimentresult][analyze_sentiment_result],\nis the result of a text analysis operation and contains a prediction or predictions about a document input.\n\nthe **error** object, [documenterror][document_error], indicates that the service had trouble processing the document and contains\nthe reason it was unsuccessful.\n\n### document error handling\n\nyou can filter for a result or error object in the list by using the `is_error` attribute. for a result object this is always `false` and for a\n[documenterror][document_error] this is `true`.\n\nfor example, to filter out all documenterrors you might use list comprehension:\n\n```python\nresponse = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(documents)\nsuccessful_responses = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]\n```\n\nyou can also use the `kind` attribute to filter between result types:\n\n```python\npoller = text_analytics_client.begin_analyze_actions(documents, actions)\nresponse = poller.result()\nfor result in response:\n    if result.kind == \"sentimentanalysis\":\n        print(f\"sentiment is {result.sentiment}\")\n    elif result.kind == \"keyphraseextraction\":\n        print(f\"key phrases: {result.key_phrases}\")\n    elif result.is_error is true:\n        print(f\"document error: {result.code}, {result.message}\")\n```\n\n### long-running operations\n\nlong-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request sent to the service to start an operation,\nfollowed by polling the service at intervals to determine whether the operation has completed or failed, and if it has\nsucceeded, to get the result.\n\nmethods that support healthcare analysis, custom text analysis, or multiple analyses are modeled as long-running operations.\nthe client exposes a `begin_<method-name>` method that returns a poller object. callers should wait\nfor the operation to complete by calling `result()` on the poller object returned from the `begin_<method-name>` method.\nsample code snippets are provided to illustrate using long-running operations [below](#examples \"examples\").\n\n## examples\n\nthe following section provides several code snippets covering some of the most common language service tasks, including:\n\n- [analyze sentiment](#analyze-sentiment \"analyze sentiment\")\n- [recognize entities](#recognize-entities \"recognize entities\")\n- [recognize linked entities](#recognize-linked-entities \"recognize linked entities\")\n- [recognize pii entities](#recognize-pii-entities \"recognize pii entities\")\n- [extract key phrases](#extract-key-phrases \"extract key phrases\")\n- [detect language](#detect-language \"detect language\")\n- [healthcare entities analysis](#healthcare-entities-analysis \"healthcare entities analysis\")\n- [multiple analysis](#multiple-analysis \"multiple analysis\")\n- [custom entity recognition][recognize_custom_entities_sample]\n- [custom single label classification][single_label_classify_sample]\n- [custom multi label classification][multi_label_classify_sample]\n- [extractive summarization][extract_summary_sample]\n- [abstractive summarization][abstract_summary_sample]\n\n### analyze sentiment\n\n[analyze_sentiment][analyze_sentiment] looks at its input text and determines whether its sentiment is positive, negative, neutral or mixed. it's response includes per-sentence sentiment analysis and confidence scores.\n\n<!-- snippet:sample_analyze_sentiment.analyze_sentiment -->\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom

documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-for-health?tabs=ner#request-access-to-the-public-preview).\n- at time of this sdk release, the service is not respecting the value passed through `model_version` to `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`, it only uses the latest model.\n\n## 5.1.0b5 (2021-02-10)\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n- rename `begin_analyze` to `begin_analyze_batch_actions`.\n- now instead of separate parameters for all of the different types of actions you can pass to `begin_analyze_batch_actions`, we accept one parameter `actions`,\nwhich is a list of actions you would like performed. the results of the actions are returned in the same order as when inputted.\n- the response object from `begin_analyze_batch_actions` has also changed. now, after the completion of your long running operation, we return a paged iterable\nof action results, in the same order they've been inputted. the actual document results for each action are included under property `document_results` of\neach action result.\n\n**new features**\n- renamed `begin_analyze_healthcare` to `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`.\n- renamed

exposed analyze healthcare entities operation metadata on the poller object returned from `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`.\n- no longer need to specify `api_version=textanalyticsapiversion.v3_1_preview_3` when calling `begin_analyze` and `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`. `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities` is still in gated preview though.\n- added a new parameter `string_index_type` to the service client methods `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`, `analyze_sentiment`, `recognize_entities`, `recognize_pii_entities`, and `recognize_linked_entities` which tells the service how to interpret string offsets.\n- added property `length` to `categorizedentity`, `sentencesentiment`, `linkedentitymatch`, `aspectsentiment`,

information, and key phrase extraction. to use, you must specify `api_version=textanalyticsapiversion.v3_1_preview_3` when creating your client.\n- we have added method `begin_analyze_healthcare`, which supports the service's health api. since the health api is currently only available in a gated preview, you need to have your subscription on the service's allow list, and you must specify `api_version=textanalyticsapiversion.v3_1_preview_3` when creating your client. note that since this is a gated preview, aad is not supported. more information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-for-health?tabs=ner#request-access-to-the-public-preview).\n\n\n## 5.1.0b2 (2020-10-06)\n\n**breaking changes**\n- removed property `length` from `categorizedentity`, `sentencesentiment`, `linkedentitymatch`, `aspectsentiment`, `opinionsentiment`, and `piientity`.\nto get the length of the text in these models, just call `len()` on the `text` property.\n- when a parameter or endpoint is not compatible with the api version you specify, we will now return a `valueerror` instead of a `notimplementederror`.\n- client side validation of input is now disabled by default. this means there will be no `validationerror`s thrown by the client sdk in the case of malformed input. the error will now be thrown by the service through an `httpresponseerror`.\n\n## 5.1.0b1 (2020-09-17)\n\n**new features**\n- we are now targeting the service's v3.1-preview api as the default. if you would like to still use version v3.0 of the service,\npass in `v3.0` to the kwarg `api_version` when creating your textanalyticsclient\n- we have added an api `recognize_pii_entities` which returns entities containing personally identifiable information for a batch of documents. only available for api version v3.1-preview and up.\n- added `offset` and `length` properties for `categorizedentity`, `sentencesentiment`, and `linkedentitymatch`. these properties are only available for api versions v3.1-preview and up.\n  - `length` is the number of characters in the text of these models\n  - `offset` is the offset of the text from the start of the document\n- we now have added support for opinion mining. to use this feature, you need to make sure you are using the service's\nv3.1-preview api. to get this support pass `show_opinion_mining` as true when calling the `analyze_sentiment` endpoint\n- add property `bing_entity_search_api_id` to the `linkedentity` class. this property is only available for v3.1-preview and up, and it is to be\nused in conjunction with the bing entity search api to fetch additional relevant information about the returned entity.\n\n## 5.0.0

`azure-core` library.\n- client and pipeline configuration is now available via keyword arguments at both the client level, and per-operation. see readme for a full list of optional configuration arguments.\n- authentication using `azure-identity` credentials\n  - see the\n  [azure identity documentation](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/readme.md)\n  for more information\n- new error hierarchy:\n    - all service errors will now use the base type: `azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror`\n    - there is one exception type derived from this base type for authentication errors:\n        - `clientauthenticationerror`: authentication failed.\n\n## 0.2.0 (2019-03-12)\n\n**features**\n\n- client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying http session open for performance\n- new method \"entities\"\n- model keyphrasebatchresultitem has a new parameter statistics\n- model keyphrasebatchresult has a new parameter statistics\n- model languagebatchresult has a new parameter statistics\n- model languagebatchresultitem has a new parameter statistics\n- model sentimentbatchresult has a new parameter statistics\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n- textanalyticsapi main client has been renamed textanalyticsclient\n- textanalyticsclient parameter is no longer a region but a complete endpoint\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.\n\n- model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. all positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.\n  to keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for python 2 and python 3. python 3 uses the \"*\" syntax for keyword-only arguments.\n- enum types now use the \"str\" mixin (class azureenum(str, enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.\n  while this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:\n  https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others\n  at a glance:\n\n  - \"is\" should not be used at all.\n  - \"format\" will return the string value, where \"%s\" string formatting will return `nameofenum.stringvalue`. format syntax should be preferred.\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n- compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0\n\n\n## 0.1.0 (2018-01-12)\n\n* initial release\n",
