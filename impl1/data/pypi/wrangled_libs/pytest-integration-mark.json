  "description": "[![formatter](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n[![pypi version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pytest-integration-mark.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-integration-mark/)\n[![pypi - python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pytest-integration-mark)](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-integration-mark/)\n\n\n# description\nprovides a pytest marker `integration` for integration tests. \nthis marker automatically applies to all tests in a specified integration test folder.\nintegration tests will not run by default, which is useful for cases where an external dependency\nneeds to be set up first (such as a database service).\n\n# installation\n\nthis is a pure python package, so it can be installed with `pip install pytest-integration-mark` \nor any other dependency manager.\n\n# usage\n\nafter installation:\n\nrunning `pytest` as usual:\n- tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` will be skipped\n- tests in `./tests/integration/...` will be skipped\n\nrunning `pytest --with-integration`:\n- tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` will run\n- tests in `./tests/integration/...` will run\n\nrunning `pytest --with-integration --integration-tests-folder integration`:\n- tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` will run\n- tests in `./integration/...` will run\n\n# development\n\nthis library uses the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager, which has to be installed before installing\nother dependencies. afterwards, run `poetry install` to create a virtualenv and install all dependencies.\nto then activate that environment, use `poetry shell`. to run a command in the environment without activating it,\nuse `poetry run <command>`.\n\n[black](https://github.com/psf/black) is used (and enforced via workflows) to format all code. poetry will install it\nautomatically, but running it is up to the user. to format the entire project, run `black .` inside the virtualenv.\n\n# contributing\n\nthis project uses the apache 2.0 license and is maintained by the data science team @ barbora. all contribution are \nwelcome in the form of prs or raised issues.\n",
