  "description": "pytest-pythonpath\n=================\n\n**note:**  this plugin is obsolete as of pytest 7.0.0.  thanks to [this pr](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/9134) from [brian okken](https://github.com/okken), you can now modify the pythonpath using the `pythonpath` configuration option.  see documentation here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/reference/reference.html#confval-pythonpath\n\nthis is a py.test plugin for adding to the pythonpath from the pytests.ini file before tests run.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\ninstall with pip::\n\n    pip install pytest-pythonpath\n\nuninstall with pip::\n\n    pip uninstall pytest-pythonpath\n\nusage\n-----\n\nadd a line in your pytest.ini file with a key of `python_paths` and provide a space seperated list of paths\nyou want inserted to the beginning of the pythonpath before any tests run:\n\n    [pytest]\n    python_paths = your/path/apps your/path/libs\n\nif you'd like to have `.pth` files be processed too, use `site_dirs` instead:\n\n    [pytest]\n    site_dirs = your/path/apps your/path/libs\n\nthis will cause the `addsitedir` function to be called on each path instead of a simple `sys.path.insert(0, path)`.\nnote that using the `site_dirs` will not place your specified paths in front of existing paths.\n\nonce this is added to your pytest.ini, you can use the py.test command as you normally would.\n\n\n",
