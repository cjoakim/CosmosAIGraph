  "description": "# pyproject-flake8 (`pflake8`)\n\na monkey patching wrapper to connect flake8 with `pyproject.toml` configuration.\n\n## update concerning versioning:\n\npyproject-flake8 so far came without explicit pinning of a flake8 version. since a [recent update](https://github.com/csachs/pyproject-flake8/issues/13) broke compatibility \u2013 not unexpectedly \u2013 the issue arose, how to handle incompatible versions of flake8 and pyproject-flake8.\nsince there are good reasons for and against version pinning, this project now tries to follow a mix of both:\nrelease versions will follow and pin identical flake8 versions, alpha versions (specific to pyproject-flake8) will pin to the similar non-alpha version of flake8, *or later*.\nthat way, users of pyproject-flake8 can decide, whether they want a fixed version known to work, or a minimum version, getting later versions, at the risk of future breakage.\n\nversions 0.0.1x are pyproject-flake8 internal versions and do not correspond to flake8. furthermore, flake8 3.8.0 was chosen as the first flake8 version to mirror this way.\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n```bash\n# e.g., suggested installation / dependency ... depending on flake8==5.0.4\n\n# for python 3.8+\npip install pyproject-flake8==5.0.4\n\n# for python 3.6+\npip install pyproject-flake8==5.0.4.post1\n```\n\n## rationale\n\n[`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) is one of the most popular python linters, `pyproject.toml` has become the [standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) for python project metadata.\n\nmore and more tools are able to utilize a shared `pyproject.toml`, alleviating the need for many individual configuration files cluttering a project repository.\n\nsince excellent `flake8` is not aimed to support `pyproject.toml`, this wrapper script tries to fix the situation.\n\n## installation\n\n### from github \n\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\n### from pypi\n\n```bash\npip install pyproject-flake8\n```\n\n### building packages\n\nuse your favorite [pep517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) compliant builder, e.g.:\n```bash\n# install first via: pip install build\npython -m build\n# packages will reside in dist/\n```\n\n## usage\n\ncall `pflake8` instead of `flake8`.\n\nconfiguration goes into the `tool.flake8` section of `pyproject.toml`: \n\n```toml\n[tool.flake8]\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore = [\"e203\"]\nmax-complexity = 10\n```\n\n## see also\n\ntwo other projects aim to address the same problem:\n\n- [flake9](https://gitlab.com/retnikt/flake9)\n- [flakehell](https://github.com/life4/flakehell)\n\nboth seem to try to do a lot more than just getting `pyproject.toml` support. `pyproject-flake8` tries to stay minimal while solving its task. \n\n[`flake8-pyproject`](https://github.com/john-hen/flake8-pyproject) adds only `pyproject.toml` support, and does this as a flake8 plugin, allowing\nthe original `flake8` command to work (rather than using `pflake8`).\n\n## caveat\n\nthis script monkey-patches flake8 and the configparser library of python, therefore loading it as a module may have unforeseen consequences.\nalpha quality. use at your own risk. it will likely break if either python or flake8 restructure their code significantly. no guarantees for stability between versions.\n\n## license\n\nunlicense\n\n",
