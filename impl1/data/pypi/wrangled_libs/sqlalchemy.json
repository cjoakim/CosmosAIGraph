object collections behave less and less like\n  tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter.\n  sqlalchemy aims to accommodate both of these\n  principles.\n* an orm doesn't need to hide the \"r\".   a relational\n  database provides rich, set-based functionality\n  that should be fully exposed.   sqlalchemy's\n  orm provides an open-ended set of patterns\n  that allow a developer to construct a custom\n  mediation layer between a domain model and\n  a relational schema, turning the so-called\n  \"object relational impedance\" issue into\n  a distant memory.\n* the developer, in all cases, makes all decisions\n  regarding the design, structure, and naming conventions\n  of both the object model as well as the relational\n  schema.   sqlalchemy only provides the means\n  to automate the execution of these decisions.\n* with sqlalchemy, there's no such thing as\n  \"the orm generated a bad query\" - you\n  retain full control over the structure of\n  queries, including how joins are organized,\n  how subqueries and correlation is used, what\n  columns are requested.  everything sqlalchemy\n  does is ultimately the result of a developer-initiated \n  decision.\n* don't use an orm if the problem doesn't need one.\n  sqlalchemy consists of a core and separate orm\n  component.   the core offers a full sql expression\n  language that allows pythonic construction\n  of sql constructs that render directly to sql\n  strings for a target database, returning\n  result sets that are essentially enhanced dbapi\n  cursors.\n* transactions should be the norm.  with sqlalchemy's\n  orm, nothing goes to permanent storage until\n  commit() is called.  sqlalchemy encourages applications\n  to create a consistent means of delineating\n  the start and end of a series of operations.\n* never render a literal value in a sql statement.\n  bound parameters are used to the greatest degree\n  possible, allowing query optimizers to cache\n  query plans effectively and making sql injection\n  attacks a non-issue.\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nlatest documentation is at:\n\nhttps://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/\n\ninstallation / requirements\n---------------------------\n\nfull documentation for installation is at\n`installation <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/intro.html#installation>`_.\n\ngetting help / development / bug reporting\n------------------------------------------\n\nplease refer to the `sqlalchemy community guide <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/support.html>`_.\n\ncode of conduct\n---------------\n\nabove all, sqlalchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, and\nconstructive communication between users and developers.\nplease see our current code of conduct at\n`code of conduct <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html>`_.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nsqlalchemy is distributed under the `mit license\n<https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.\n\n",
