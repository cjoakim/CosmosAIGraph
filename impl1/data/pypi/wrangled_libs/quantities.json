  "description": "==========\nquantities\n==========\n\nquantities is designed to handle arithmetic and\nconversions of physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality\nspecified by various units, and possibly an uncertainty. see the tutorial_\nfor examples. quantities builds on the popular numpy library and is\ndesigned to work with numpy ufuncs, many of which are already\nsupported. quantities is actively developed, and while the current features\nand api are stable, test coverage is incomplete so the package is not\nsuggested for mission-critical applications.\n\n|pypi version|_ |build status|_\n\n.. |pypi version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/quantities.png\n.. _`pypi version`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantities\n.. |build status| image:: https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master\n.. _`build status`: https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities/actions/workflows/test.yml\n.. _tutorial: http://python-quantities.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/tutorial.html\n\n\na python package for handling physical quantities. the source code and issue\ntracker are hosted on github:\n\nhttps://www.github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities\n\ndownload\n--------\nget the latest version of quantities from\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantities/\n\nto get the git version do::\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities.git\n\n\ndocumentation and usage\n-----------------------\nyou can find the official documentation at:\n\nhttp://python-quantities.readthedocs.io/\n\nhere is a simple example:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   >>> import quantities as pq\n   >>> distance = 42*pq.metre\n   >>> time = 17*pq.second\n   >>> velocity = distance / time\n   >>> \"%.3f %s\" % (velocity.magnitude, velocity.dimensionality)\n   '2.471 m/s'\n   >>> velocity + 3\n   traceback (most recent call last):\n     ...\n   valueerror: unable to convert between units of \"dimensionless\" and \"m/s\"\n\ninstallation\n------------\nquantities has a hard dependency on the `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ library.\nyou should install it first, please refer to the numpy installation guide:\n\nhttp://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html\n\nto install quantities itself, then simply run::\n\n    $ pip install quantities\n\n\ntests\n-----\nto execute all tests, install pytest::\n\n    $ python -m pip install pytest\n\nand run::\n\n    $ pytest\n\nin the current directory. the master branch is automatically tested by\ngithub actions.\n\nauthor\n------\nquantities was originally written by darren dale, and has received contributions from `many people`_.\n\n.. _`many people`: https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities/graphs/contributors\n\nlicense\n-------\nquantities only uses bsd compatible code.  see the open source\ninitiative `licenses page <http://www.opensource.org/licenses>`_\nfor details on individual licenses.\n\nsee `doc/user/license.rst <doc/user/license.rst>`_ for further details on the license of quantities\n",
