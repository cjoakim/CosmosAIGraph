status](https://github.com/ansible-community/pytest-ansible/actions/workflows/tox.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ansible-community/pytest-ansible/actions/workflows/tox.yml)\n[![version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pytest-ansible.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-ansible/)\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pytest-ansible.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-ansible/)\n[![supported python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pytest-ansible.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-ansible/)\n\nthe `pytest-ansible` plugin is designed to provide seamless integration between `pytest` and `ansible`, allowing you to efficiently run and test ansible-related tasks and scenarios within your pytest test suite. this plugin enhances the testing workflow by offering three distinct pieces of functionality:\n\n1. **unit testing for ansible collections**:\n   this feature aids in running unit tests for `ansible collections` using `pytest`. it allows you to validate the behavior of your ansible `modules` and `roles` in isolation, ensuring that each component functions as expected.\n\n2. **molecule scenario integration**:\n   the plugin assists in running molecule `scenarios` using `pytest`. this integration streamlines the testing of ansible roles and playbooks across different environments, making it easier to identify and fix issues across diverse setups.\n\n3. **ansible integration for pytest tests**:\n   with this functionality, you can seamlessly use `ansible` from within your `pytest` tests. this opens up possibilities to interact with ansible components and perform tasks like provisioning resources, testing configurations, and more, all while leveraging the power and flexibility of pytest.\n\n## installation\n\ninstall this plugin using `pip`:\n\n```\npip install pytest-ansible\n```\n\n## getting started\n\n### unit testing for ansible collections\n\nthe `pytest-ansible-units` plugin allows ansible collection's unit tests to be run with only `pytest`. it offers a focused approach to testing individual ansible modules. with this plugin, you can write and execute unit tests specifically for ansible modules, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your module code. this is particularly useful for verifying the correctness of module behavior in isolation.\n\nto use `pytest-ansible-units`, follow these steps:\n\n1. install the plugin using pip:\n\n```\npip install pytest-ansible\n```\n\n2. ensure you have python 3.8 or greater, ansible-core, and pyyaml installed.\n\n3. depending on your preferred directory structure, you can clone collections into the appropriate paths.\n\n   - **collection tree approach**: the preferred approach is to clone the collections being developed into it's proper collection tree path. this eliminates the need for any\n     symlinks and other collections being developed can be cloned into the same tree structure.\n\n     ```\n     git clone <repo> collections/ansible_collections/<namespace>/<name>\n     ```\n\n     note: run `pytest` in the root of the collection directory, adjacent to the collection's `galaxy.yml` file.\n\n   - **shallow tree approach**:\n\n     ```\n     git clone <repo>\n     ```\n\n     notes:\n\n     - run `pytest` in the root of the collection directory, adjacent to the collection's `galaxy.yml` file.\n     - a collections directory will be created in the repository directory, and collection content will be linked into it.\n\n4. execute the unit tests using pytest: `pytest tests`\n\n### help\n\nthe following may be added to the collections' `pyproject.toml` file to limit warnings and set the default path for the collection's tests\n\n```\n[tool.pytest.ini_options]\ntestpaths = [\n    \"tests\",\n]\nfilterwarnings = [\n    'ignore:ansiblecollectionfinder has already been configured',\n]\n```\n\ninformation from the `galaxy.yml` file is used to build the `collections` directory structure and link the contents. the `galaxy.yml` file should reflect the correct collection namespace and name.\n\none way to detect issues without running the tests is to run:\n\n```\npytest --collect-only\n```\n\nthe follow errors may be seen:\n\n```\ne   modulenotfounderror: no module named 'ansible_collections'\n```\n\n- check the `galaxy.yml` file for an accurate namespace and name\n- ensure `pytest` is being run from the collection's root directory, adjacent to the `galaxy.yml`\n\n```\nhint: remove __pycache__ / .pyc files and/or use a unique basename for your test file modules\n```\n\n## molecule scenario integration\n\nthis functionality assists in running molecule `scenarios` using `pytest`. it enables pytest discovery of all `molecule.yml` files inside the codebase and runs them as pytest tests. it allows you to include molecule scenarios as part of your pytest test suite, allowing you to thoroughly test your ansible roles and playbooks across different scenarios and environments.\n\n## running molecule scenarios using pytest\n\nmolecule scenarios can be tested using 2 different methods if molecule is installed.\n\n**recommended:**\n\nadd a `test_integration.py` file to the `tests/integration` directory of the ansible collection:\n\n```\n\"\"\"tests for molecule scenarios.\"\"\"\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function\n\nfrom pytest_ansible.molecule import moleculescenario\n\n\ndef test_integration(molecule_scenario: moleculescenario) -> none:\n    \"\"\"run molecule for each scenario.\n\n    :param molecule_scenario: the molecule scenario object\n    \"\"\"\n    proc = molecule_scenario.test()\n    assert proc.returncode == 0\n```\n\nthe `molecule_scenario` fixture provides parameterized molecule scenarios discovered in the collection's `extensions/molecule` directory, as well as other directories within the collection.\n\n`molecule test -s <scenario>` will be run for each scenario and a completed subprocess returned from the `test()` call.\n\n**legacy:**\n\nrun molecule with the `--molecule` command line parameter to inject each molecule directory found in the current working directory. each scenario will be injected as an external test in the the tests available for pytest. due to the nature of this approach, the molecule scenarios are not represented as python tests and may not show in the ide's pytest test tree.\n\nto run molecule scenarios using pytest, follow these steps:\n\n1. install the `pytest-ansible` plugin using pip:\n\n```\npip install pytest-ansible\n```\n\n2. execute pytest to run molecule scenarios: `pytest`\n\n## ansible integration for pytest tests\n\nthe `ansible_module`, `ansible_adhoc`, `localhost`, and `ansible_facts` fixtures are provided to help you integrate ansible functionalities into your pytest tests. these fixtures allow you to interact with ansible modules, run commands on localhost, fetch ansible facts, and more.\n\n## fixtures and helpers for use in tests\n\nhere's a quick overview of the available fixtures:\n\n- `ansible_module`: allows you to call ansible modules directly within your test functions.\n- `ansible_adhoc`: provides a function to initialize a `hostmanager` object to work with ansible inventory.\n- `localhost`: a convenience fixture for running ansible modules that typically run on the local machine.\n- `ansible_facts`: returns a json structure representing system facts for the associated inventory.\n\n### usage\n\nonce installed, the following `pytest` command-line parameters are available:\n\n```bash\npytest \\\n    [--inventory <path_to_inventory>] \\\n    [--extra-inventory <path_to_extra_inventory>] \\\n    [--host-pattern <host-pattern>] \\\n    [--connection <plugin>] \\\n    [--module-path <path_to_modules] \\\n    [--user <username>] \\\n    [--become] \\\n    [--become-user <username>] \\\n    [--become-method <method>] \\\n    [--ask-become-pass] \\\n    [--limit <limit>] \\\n    [--ansible-unit-inject-only] \\\n    [--molecule] \\\n    [--molecule-unavailable-driver] \\\n    [--skip-no-git-change] \\\n    [--check]\n```\n\n### inventory\n\nusing ansible first starts with defining your inventory. this can be done in\nseveral ways, but to start, we'll use the `ansible_adhoc` fixture.\n\n```python\ndef test_my_inventory(ansible_adhoc):\n    hosts = ansible_adhoc()\n```\n\nin the example above, the `hosts` variable is an instance of the `hostmanager`\nclass and describes your ansible inventory. for this to work, you'll need to\ntell `ansible` where to find your inventory. inventory can be anything\nsupported by ansible, which includes an [ini\nfile](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html) or an\nexecutable script that returns [properly formatted\njson](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html).\nfor example,\n\n```bash\npytest --inventory my_inventory.ini --host-pattern all\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\npytest --inventory path/to/my/script.py --host-pattern webservers\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\npytest --inventory one.example.com,two.example.com --host-pattern all\n```\n\nin the above examples, the inventory provided at runtime will be used in all\ntests that use the `ansible_adhoc` fixture. a more realistic scenario may\ninvolve using different inventory files (or host patterns) with different\ntests. to accomplish this, the fixture `ansible_adhoc` allows you to customize\nthe inventory parameters. read on for more detail on using the `ansible_adhoc`\nfixture.\n\n### extra inventory\n\nusing ansible first starts with defining your extra inventory. this feature was added in version 2.3.0, and is intended\nto allow the user to work with two different inventories. this can be done in several ways, but to start,\nwe'll use the `ansible_adhoc` fixture.\n\nfor example,\n\n```bash\npytest --inventory my_inventory.ini --extra-inventory my_second_inventory.ini --host-pattern host_in_second_inventory\n```\n\n#### fixture `ansible_adhoc`\n\nthe `ansible_adhoc` fixture returns a function used to initialize\na `hostmanager` object. the `ansible_adhoc` fixture will default to parameters\nsupplied to the `pytest` command-line, but also allows one to provide keyword\narguments used to initialize the inventory.\n\nthe example below demonstrates basic usage with options supplied at run-time to\n`pytest`.\n\n```python\ndef test_all_the_pings(ansible_adhoc):\n    ansible_adhoc().all.ping()\n```\n\nthe following example demonstrates available keyword arguments when creating\na `hostmanager` object.\n\n```python\ndef test_uptime(ansible_adhoc):\n    # take down the database\n    ansible_adhoc(inventory='db1.example.com,', user='ec2-user',\n        become=true, become_user='root').all.command('reboot')\n```\n\nthe `hostmanager` object returned by the `ansible_adhoc()` function provides\nnumerous ways of calling ansible modules against some, or all, of the\ninventory. the following demonstrates sample usage.\n\n```python\ndef test_host_manager(ansible_adhoc):\n    hosts = ansible_adhoc()\n\n    # __getitem__\n    hosts['all'].ping()\n    hosts['localhost'].ping()\n\n    # __getattr__\n    hosts.all.ping()\n    hosts.localhost.ping()\n\n    # supports [ansible host patterns](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_patterns.html)\n    hosts['webservers:!phoenix'].ping()  # all webservers that are not in phoenix\n    hosts[0].ping()\n    hosts[0:2].ping()\n\n    assert 'one.example.com' in hosts\n\n    assert hasattr(hosts, 'two.example.com')\n\n    for a_host in hosts:\n        a_host.ping()\n```\n\n#### fixture `localhost`\n\nthe `localhost` fixture is a convenience fixture that surfaces\na `moduledispatcher` instance for ansible host running `pytest`. this is\nconvenient when using ansible modules that typically run on the local machine,\nsuch as cloud modules (ec2, gce etc...).\n\n```python\ndef test_do_something_cloudy(localhost, ansible_adhoc):\n    \"\"\"deploy an ec2 instance using multiple fixtures.\"\"\"\n    params = dict(\n        key_name='some_key',\n        instance_type='t2.micro',\n        image='ami-123456',\n        wait=true,\n        group='webservers',\n        count=1,\n        vpc_subnet_id='subnet-29e63245',\n        assign_public_ip=true,\n    )\n\n    # deploy an ec2 instance from localhost using the `ansible_adhoc` fixture\n    ansible_adhoc(inventory='localhost,', connection='local').localhost.ec2(**params)\n\n    # deploy an ec2 instance from localhost using the `localhost` fixture\n    localhost.ec2(**params)\n```\n\n#### fixture `ansible_module`\n\nthe `ansible_module` fixture allows tests and fixtures to call [ansible\nmodules](http://docs.ansible.com/modules.html). unlike the `ansible_adhoc`\nfixture, this fixture only uses the options supplied to `pytest` at run time.\n\na very basic example demonstrating the ansible [`ping` module](http://docs.ansible.com/ping_module.html):\n\n```python\ndef test_ping(ansible_module):\n    ansible_module.ping()\n```\n\na more involved example of updating the sshd configuration, and restarting the\nservice.\n\n```python\ndef test_sshd_config(ansible_module):\n\n    # update sshd maxsessions\n    contacted = ansible_module.lineinfile(\n        dest=\"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\",\n        regexp=\"^#?maxsessions .*\",\n        line=\"maxsessions 150\")\n    )\n\n    # assert desired outcome\n    for (host, result) in contacted.items():\n        assert 'failed' not in result, result['msg']\n        assert 'changed' in result\n\n    # restart sshd\n    contacted = ansible_module.service(\n        name=\"sshd\",\n        state=\"restarted\"\n    )\n\n    # assert successful restart\n    for (host, result) in contacted.items():\n        assert 'changed' in result and result['changed']\n        assert result['name'] == 'sshd'\n\n    # do other stuff ...\n```\n\n#### fixture `ansible_facts`\n\nthe `ansible_facts` fixture returns a json structure representing the system\nfacts for the associated inventory. sample fact data is available in the\n[ansible\ndocumentation](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_variables.html#information-discovered-from-systems-facts).\n\nnote, this fixture is provided for convenience and could easily be called using\n`ansible_module.setup()`.\n\na systems facts can be useful when deciding whether to skip a test ...\n\n```python\ndef test_something_with_amazon_ec2(ansible_facts):\n    for facts in ansible_facts:\n        if 'ec2.internal' != facts['ansible_domain']:\n            pytest.skip(\"this test only applies to ec2 instances\")\n\n```\n\nadditionally, since facts are just ansible modules, you could inspect the\ncontents of the `ec2_facts` module for greater granularity ...\n\n```python\n\ndef test_terminate_us_east_1_instances(ansible_adhoc):\n\n    for facts in ansible_adhoc().all.ec2_facts():\n        if facts['ansible_ec2_placement_region'].startswith('us-east'):\n            '''do some testing'''\n```\n\n#### parameterize with `pytest.mark.ansible`\n\nperhaps the `--ansible-inventory=<inventory>` includes many systems, but you\nonly wish to interact with a subset. the `pytest.mark.ansible` marker can be\nused to modify the `pytest-ansible` command-line parameters for a single\ntest. please note, the fixture `ansible_adhoc` is the prefer mechanism for\ninteracting with ansible inventory within tests.\n\nfor example, to interact with the local system, you would adjust the\n`host_pattern` and `connection` parameters.\n\n```python\n@pytest.mark.ansible(host_pattern='local,', connection='local')\ndef test_copy_local(ansible_module):\n\n    # create a file with random data\n    contacted = ansible_module.copy(\n        dest='/etc/motd',\n        content='pytest is amazing!',\n        owner='root',\n        group='root',\n        mode='0644',\n    )\n\n    # assert only a single host was contacted\n    assert len(contacted) == 1, \\\n        \"unexpected number of hosts contacted (%d != %d)\" % \\\n        (1, len(contacted))\n\n    assert 'local' in contacted\n\n    # assert the copy module reported changes\n    assert 'changed' in contacted['local']\n    assert contacted['local']['changed']\n```\n\nnote, the parameters provided by `pytest.mark.ansible` will apply to all\nclass methods.\n\n```python\n@pytest.mark.ansible(host_pattern='local,', connection='local')\nclass test_local(object):\n    def test_install(self, ansible_module):\n        '''do some testing'''\n    def test_template(self, ansible_module):\n        '''do some testing'''\n    def test_service(self, ansible_module):\n        '''do some testing'''\n```\n\n#### inspecting results\n\nwhen using the `ansible_adhoc`, `localhost` or `ansible_module` fixtures, the\nobject returned will be an instance of class `adhocresult`. the\n`adhocresult` class can be inspected as follows:\n\n```python\n\ndef test_adhoc_result(ansible_adhoc):\n    contacted = ansible_adhoc(inventory=my_inventory).command(\"date\")\n\n    # as a dictionary\n    for (host, result) in contacted.items():\n        assert result.is_successful, \"failed on host %s\" % host\n    for result in contacted.values():\n        assert result.is_successful\n    for host in contacted.keys():\n        assert host in ['localhost', 'one.example.com']\n\n    assert contacted.localhost.is_successful\n\n    # as a list\n    assert len(contacted) > 0\n    assert 'localhost' in contacted\n\n    # as an iterator\n    for result in contacted:\n        assert result.is_successful\n\n    # with __getattr__\n    assert contacted.localhost.is_successful\n\n    # or __getitem__\n    assert contacted['localhost'].is_successful\n```\n\nusing the `adhocresult` object provides ways to conveniently access results\nfor different hosts involved in the ansible adhoc command. once the specific\nhost result is found, you may inspect the result of the ansible adhoc command\non that use by way of the `moduleresult` interface. the `moduleresult`\nclass represents the dictionary returned by the ansible module for a particular\nhost. the contents of the dictionary depend on the module called.\n\nthe `moduleresult` interface provides some convenient properties to\ndetermine the success of the module call. examples are included below.\n\n```python\n\ndef test_module_result(localhost):\n    contacted = localhost.command(\"find /tmp\")\n\n    assert contacted.localhost.is_successful\n    assert contacted.localhost.is_ok\n    assert contacted.localhost.is_changed\n    assert not contacted.localhost.is_failed\n\n    contacted = localhost.shell(\"exit 1\")\n    assert contacted.localhost.is_failed\n    assert not contacted.localhost.is_successful\n```\n\nthe contents of the json returned by an ansible module differs from module to\nmodule. for guidance, consult the documentation and examples for the specific\n[ansible module](http://docs.ansible.com/modules_by_category.html).\n\n#### exception handling\n\nif `ansible` is unable to connect to any inventory, an exception will be raised.\n\n```python\n@pytest.mark.ansible(inventory='unreachable.example.com,')\ndef test_shutdown(ansible_module):\n\n    # attempt to ping a host that is down (or doesn't exist)\n    pytest.raises(pytest_ansible.ansiblehostunreachable):\n        ansible_module.ping()\n```\n\nsometimes, only a single host is unreachable, and others will have properly\nreturned data. the following demonstrates how to catch the exception, and\ninspect the results.\n\n```python\n@pytest.mark.ansible(inventory='good:bad')\ndef test_inventory_unreachable(ansible_module):\n    exc_info = pytest.raises(pytest_ansible.ansiblehostunreachable, ansible_module.ping)\n    (contacted, dark) = exc_info.value.results\n\n    # inspect the json result...\n    for (host, result) in contacted.items():\n        assert result['ping'] == 'pong'\n\n    for (host, result) in dark.items():\n        assert result['failed'] == true\n```\n\n## contributing\n\ncontributions are very
