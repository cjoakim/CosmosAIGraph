  "description": "seasonal\n========\nrobustly estimate and remove trend and periodicity in a timeseries.\n\n`seasonal` can recover sharp trend and period estimates from noisy\ntimeseries data with only a few periods.  it is intended for\nestimating season, trend, and level when initializing structural\ntimeseries models like holt-winters. input samples are\nassumed evenly-spaced from a continuous real-valued signal with noise but\nno anomalies.\n\nthe seasonal estimate will be a list of period-over-period averages at\neach seasonal offset. you may specify a period length, or have it\nestimated from the data. the latter is an interesting capability of\nthis package.\n\ntrend removal in this package is in service of isolating and\nestimating the periodic (non-trend) variation. a lowpass smoothing of\nthe data is removed from the original series, preserving original\nseasonal variation.  detrending is accomplishd by a coarse fitted\nspline, mean or median filters, or a fitted line.\n\nsee https://github.com/welch/seasonal/readme.md for details on installation, api, theory, and examples.\n\ndependencies\n-------------\n* package: numpy, scipy\n* extras:  pandas, matplotlib",
