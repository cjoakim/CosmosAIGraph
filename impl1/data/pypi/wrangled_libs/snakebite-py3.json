  "description": "\ud83d\udc0d about this fork\ud83c\udf74\n--------------------\nthis is a fork of https://github.com/spotify/snakebite, via\nhttps://github.com/kirklg/snakebite/tree/feature/python3. we maintain it enough\nto work for our needs at the internet archive. we use the library with our cdh5\ncluster and have not tested it with any other versions of hadoop. please help\nus improve this! or make your own fork. no hard feelings.\n\n![snakebite mini logo](https://github.com/internetarchive/snakebite-py3/blob/master/doc/logo/logo-mini-typo.png)\n---\n\nsnakebite is a python library that provides a pure python hdfs client\nand a wrapper around hadoops minicluster. the client uses protobuf for\ncommunicating with the namenode and comes in the form of a library and a\ncommand line interface. currently, the snakebite client supports most\nactions that involve the namenode and reading data from datanodes.\n\n*note:* all methods that read data from a data node are able to check\nthe crc during transfer, but this is disabled by default because of\nperformance reasons. this is the opposite behaviour from the stock\nhadoop client.\n\n~snakebite requires python2 (python3 is not supported yet)~ and\npython-protobuf 2.4.1 or higher.\n\nsnakebite 1.3.x has been tested mainly against cloudera cdh4.1.3 (hadoop\n2.0.0) in production. tests pass on hortonworks hdp 2.0.3.22-alpha\n(protocol versions 7 and 8)\n\nsnakebite 2.x has been tested on hortonworks hdp2.0 and cdh5 beta and\nonly supports hadoop 2.2.0 and up (protocol version 9)!\n\ninstalling\n==========\n\nsnakebite-py3 releases will be available through pypi at\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/snakebite-py3/>\n\nto install snakebite run:\n\n`pip install snakebite-py3`\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\nmore information and documentation can be found at\nhttps://snakebite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\ndevelopment\n===========\n\ntravis ci status: [![travis](https://travis-ci.org/internetarchive/snakebite-py3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/internetarchive/snakebite-py3)\n[![join the chat at https://gitter.im/spotify/snakebite](https://badges.gitter.im/spotify/snakebite.svg)](https://gitter.im/spotify/snakebite?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\ncopyright 2013-2016 spotify ab\ncopyright 2016-2019 internet archive and individual contributors\n",
