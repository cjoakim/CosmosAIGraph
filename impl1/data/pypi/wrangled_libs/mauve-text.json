  "description": "# mauve\n\nmauve is a library built on pytorch and huggingface transformers to measure the gap between neural text and human text \nwith the eponymous mauve measure, \nintroduced [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01454.pdf) (neurips 2021 ooutstanding paper).\n\n\n### [documentation link](krishnap25.github.io/mauve/)\n\n### _new: mauve is available via [huggingface datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/how_to_metrics.html)!_\n\n\n**features**:\n- mauve with quantization using *k*-means. \n- adaptive selection of *k*-means hyperparameters. \n- compute mauve using pre-computed gpt-2 features (i.e., terminal hidden state), \n    or featurize raw text using huggingface transformers + pytorch.\n- new: minibatching for efficient implementation. \n\n## installation\n\nfor a direct install, run this command from your terminal:\n```\npip install mauve-text\n``` \n    \n## citation\nif you find this package useful, or you use it in your research, please cite:\n```\n@inproceedings{pillutla-etal:mauve:neurips2021,\n  title={mauve: measuring the gap between neural text and human text using divergence frontiers},\n  author={pillutla, krishna and swayamdipta, swabha and zellers, rowan and thickstun, john and welleck, sean and choi, yejin and harchaoui, zaid},\n  booktitle = {neurips},\n  year      = {2021}\n}\n\n```\nfurther, the frontier integral was introduced in this paper:\n```\n@inproceedings{liu-etal:divergence:neurips2021,\n  title={{divergence frontiers for generative models: sample complexity, quantization effects, and frontier integrals}},\n  author={liu, lang and pillutla, krishna and  welleck, sean and oh, sewoong and choi, yejin and harchaoui, zaid},\n  booktitle = {neurips},\n  year      = {2021}\n}\n```\n    \n## acknowledgements\nthis work was supported by nsf dms-2134012, nsf ccf-2019844, nsf dms-2023166, the darpa mcs program through niwc pacific (n66001-19-2-4031), the cifar \"learning in machines & brains\" program, a qualcomm innovation fellowship, and faculty research awards.\n\n\n\n\n",
