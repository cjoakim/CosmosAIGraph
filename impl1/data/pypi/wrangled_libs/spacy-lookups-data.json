  "description": "<a href=\"https://explosion.ai\"><img src=\"https://explosion.ai/assets/img/logo.svg\" width=\"125\" height=\"125\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\n# spacy lookups data\n\nthis repository contains additional data files to be used with\n[spacy](https://spacy.io) v2.2+. when it's installed in the same environment as\nspacy, this package makes the resources for each language available as an entry\npoint, which spacy checks when setting up the `vocab` and `lookups`.\n\nfeel free to submit pull requests to update the data. for issues related to the\ndata, lookups and integration, please use the\n[spacy issue tracker](https://github.com/explosion/spacy/issues).\n\n[![tests](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-lookups-data/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-lookups-data/actions/workflows/tests.yml)\n[![current release version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/explosion/spacy-lookups-data.svg?include_prereleases&style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-lookups-data/releases)\n[![pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/spacy-lookups-data.svg?style=flat-square&logo=pypi&logocolor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/spacy-lookups-data/)\n[![conda version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/spacy-lookups-data.svg?style=flat-square&logo=conda-forge&logocolor=white)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/spacy-lookups-data)\n\n## faq\n\n### why does this exist?\n\nthe main purpose of this package is to make the default spacy installation\nsmaller and not force every user to download large data files for _all_\nlanguages by default. lookups data is now either provided **via the pre-trained\nmodels** (which serialize out their vocabulary and lookup tables) or by\n**explicitly installing this package** or `spacy[lookups]`.\n\n### when should i install this?\n\nyou should install this package if you want to use lemmatization for languages\nthat don't yet have a [pretrained model](https://spacy.io/models) available for\ndownload and don't rely on third-party libraries for lemmatization \u2013 for example\nfor **serbian** or **turkish** ([see data files](spacy_lookups_data/data)).\n\nif you are training new models with spacy, you should probably install this,\nsince it contains lemmatization and normalization data for 25+ languages that is\nno longer included as part of the main spacy library. in particular, you should\ninstall it if you're creating a **blank model** and you want it to include\nlemmatization and normalization data. once you've saved out the model (e.g. via\n`nlp.to_disk`), it will include the lookup tables as part of its `vocab`.\n\n### is this package only for lemmatization?\n\nthis package used to only be for lemmatization, but it has been extended to\ninclude normalization data for many languages. as of v0.3.1 it also includes\noptional probability and brown cluster data that used to be distributed with\nprovided models in spacy v2.2 but is no longer included in spacy v2.3. in the\nfuture it may include other lookup lists and tables as well, e.g. large\ntokenizer exception files.\n\n## running tests\n\nthis package now also includes all\n[data-specific tests](spacy_lookups_data/tests). the test suite depends on\nspacy.\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\npython -m pytest spacy_lookups_data\n```\n\nif you've installed the package in your spacy environment, you can also run the\ntests like this:\n\n```bash\npython -m pytest --pyargs spacy_lookups_data\n```\n\n## bug reports and other issues\n\nplease use [spacy's issue tracker](https://github.com/explosion/spacy/issues) to\nreport a bug, or open a new thread on the\n[discussion board](https://github.com/explosion/spacy/discussions) for any other\nissue.\n",
