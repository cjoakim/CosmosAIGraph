  "description": "a backport of traceback to older supported pythons.\n\n >>> import traceback2 as traceback\n\nprofit.\n\nthings to be aware of!\n\nin python 2.x, unlike traceback, traceback2 creates unicode output (because it\ndepends on the linecache2 module).\n\nexception frame clearing silently does nothing if the interpreter in use does\nnot support it.\n\ntraceback2._some_str, which while not an official api is so old its likely in\nuse behaves similarly to the python3 version - objects where unicode(obj) fails\nbut str(object) works will be shown as b'thestrvaluerepr'.",
