  "description": "\nstl decompose\n=============\n\nthis is a relatively naive python implementation of a seasonal and trend decomposition using loess smoothing. commonly referred to as an \"stl decomposition\", cleveland's 1990 paper is the canonical reference.  \n\nthis implementation is a variation of (and takes inspiration from) the implementation of the ``seasonal_decompose`` method `in statsmodels <http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose.html#statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose>`_. in this implementation, the trend component is calculated by substituting a configurable `loess regression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/local_regression>`_ for the convolutional method used in ``seasonal_decompose``. it also extends the existing ``decomposeresult`` from ``statsmodels`` to allow for forecasting based on the calculated decomposition. \n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nthe ``stldecompose`` package is relatively lightweight. it uses ``pandas.dataframe`` for inputs and outputs, and exposes only a couple of primary methods - ``decompose()`` and ``forecast()`` - as well as a handful of built-in forecasting functions. \n\nsee `the included ipython notebook <https://github.com/jrmontag/stldecompose/blob/master/stl-usage-example.ipynb>`_ for more details and usage examples.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\na python 3 virtual environment is recommended.\n\nthe preferred method of installation is via ``pip``::\n\n    (env) $ pip install stldecompose\n\nif you'd like the bleeding-edge version, you can also install from this github repo::\n\n    (env) $ git clone git@github.com:jrmontag/stldecompose.git \n    (env) $ cd stldecompose; pip install . \n\n\nmore resources\n--------------\n\n- ``statsmodels`` `time series analysis <http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html>`_ package\n- hyndman's `otexts reference on stl decomposition <https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/5>`_ \n- cleveland et al. 1990 [`pdf <https://www.wessa.net/download/stl.pdf>`_]\n\n\n",
