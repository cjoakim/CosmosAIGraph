be sure to learn about [**common pitfalls**](https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/wiki/pitfalls) of using this python sdk before starting a project.  \n\n\n## features\n\n:heavy_check_mark: feature available  :heavy_multiplication_x: feature planned but not yet supported  :heavy_minus_sign: no support planned*\n\n*features that are not planned may be prioritized in a future release, but are not currently planned\n\nthese clients only support the **mqtt protocol**.\n\n### iothub device client\n\n| features                                                                                                         | status                     | description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-security-deployment)                     | :heavy_check_mark:         | connect your device to iot hub securely with supported authentication, including symmetric key, x-509 self signed, certificate authority (ca) signed, and sastoken                                     |\n| [send device-to-cloud message](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c)     | :heavy_check_mark:         | send device-to-cloud messages (max 256kb) to iot hub with the option to add custom properties.                                                                                                                       |\n| [receive cloud-to-device messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-c2d) | :heavy_check_mark:         | receive cloud-to-device messages and read associated custom and system properties from iot hub.                                                        |\n| [device twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins)                     | :heavy_check_mark:         | iot hub persists a device twin for each device that you connect to iot hub.  the device can perform operations like get twin tags, subscribe to desired properties.                                                |\n| [direct methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods)                 | :heavy_check_mark:         | iot hub gives you the ability to invoke direct methods on devices from the cloud.  the sdk supports handler for method specific and generic operation.                                                            |\n| [connection status and error reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/iothub/common-error-codes)     | :heavy_check_mark:   | error reporting for iot hub supported error code.                                                                                         |\n| connection retry                                                                                                   | :heavy_check_mark:         | dropped connections will be retried with a fixed 10 second interval by default. this functionality can be disabled if desired, and the interval can be configured   |\n| [upload file to blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-file-upload)               | :heavy_check_mark:         | a device can initiate a file upload and notifies iot hub when the upload is complete.  |\n\n### iothub module client\n\n**note:** iot edge for python is scoped to linux containers & devices only.

device provisioning service \nthat will impact the sdk's ability to connect to these services. in october 2022, both services will migrate from the current \n[baltimore cybertrust ca root](https://baltimore-cybertrust-root.chain-demos.digicert.com/info/index.html) to the \n[digicert global g2 ca root](https://global-root-g2.chain-demos.digicert.com/info/index.html). there will be a \ntransition period beforehand where your iot devices must have both the baltimore and digicert public certificates \ninstalled in their certificate store in order to prevent connectivity issues.\n\n**devices with only the baltimore public certificate installed will lose the ability to connect to azure iot hub and device provisioning service in october 2022.**\n\nto prepare for this change, make sure your device's certificate store has both of these public certificates installed.\n\nfor a more in depth explanation as to why the iot services are doing this, please see\n[this article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/azure-iot-tls-critical-changes-are-almost-here-and-why-you/ba-p/2393169).\n\n\n## contributing\n\nthis project welcomes contributions
