  "description": "``zope.error``\n==============\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.error/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg\n        :target: https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.error/actions/workflows/tests.yml\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/zopefoundation/zope.error/badge.svg\n        :target: https://coveralls.io/github/zopefoundation/zope.error\n\n\nthis package provides an error reporting utility which is able to store errors.\n\n\n=========\n changes\n=========\n\n5.0 (2023-07-06)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.11.\n\n- drop support for python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\n\n4.6 (2022-08-29)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.\n\n- drop support for python 3.4.\n\n\n4.5.0 (2018-10-19)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.7.\n\n\n4.4.0 (2017-07-22)\n==================\n\n- drop support for python 3.3.\n\n- add support for python 3.6.\n\n- 100% test coverage.\n\n- remove internal ``_compat`` module in favor of ``six``, which we\n  already had a dependency on.\n\n- stop decoding in ascii (whatever the default codec is) in favor of utf-8.\n\n- tighten the interface of\n  ``ilocalerrorreportingutility.setproperties``. now\n  ``ignored_exceptions`` is required to be str or byte objects.\n  previously any object that could be converted into a text object via\n  the text constructor was accepted, but this encouraged passing class\n  objects, when in actuality we need the class *name*.\n\n- stop ignoring ``keyboardinterrupt`` exceptions and other similar\n  ``baseexception`` exceptions during the ``raising`` method.\n\n4.3.0 (2016-07-07)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.5.\n\n- drop support for python 2.6.\n\n- bugfix: fix leak by converting ``request.url`` to string in\n  ``errorreportingutility``\n\n4.2.0 (2014-12-27)\n==================\n\n- add support for pypy and pypy3.\n\n- add support for python 3.4.\n\n\n4.1.1 (2014-12-22)\n==================\n\n- enable testing on travis.\n\n\n4.1.0 (2013-02-21)\n==================\n\n- add compatibility with python 3.3\n\n\n4.0.0 (2012-12-10)\n==================\n\n- replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.\n\n- drop support for python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n- sort request items for presentation in the error reporting utility.\n\n- don't html-escape html tracebacks twice.\n\n\n3.7.4 (2012-02-01)\n==================\n\n- add explicit tests for escaping introduced in 3.7.3.\n\n- handing names of classes those string representation cannot\n  be determined as untrusted input thus escaping them in error reports.\n\n- fix tests on python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n3.7.3 (2012-01-17)\n==================\n\n- escape untrusted input before constructing html for error reporting.\n\n3.7.2 (2010-10-30)\n==================\n\n- set ``copy_to_zlog`` by default to 1/true.\n  having it turned off is a small problem, because fatal (startup) errors\n  will not get logged anywhere.\n\n\n3.7.1 (2010-09-25)\n==================\n\n- add test extra to declare test dependency on ``zope.testing``.\n\n\n3.7.0 (2009-09-29)\n==================\n\n- clean up dependencies. droped all testing dependencies as we only need\n  zope.testing now.\n\n- fix importerror when zope.testing is not available for some reason.\n\n- remove zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.\n\n- remove word \"version\" from changelog entries.\n\n- change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as\n  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired. also changed `cheeseshop` to\n  `pypi` in the package's homepage url.\n\n- add dependency on zodb3 as we use persistent.\n\n- use a mock request for testing. dropped the dependency on zope.publisher\n  which was really only a testing dependency.\n\n- reduce the dependency on zope.container to one on zope.location by no\n  longer using the contained mix-in class.\n\n3.6.0 (2009-01-31)\n==================\n\n- use zope.container instead of zope.app.container\n\n- move error log bootstrapping logic (which was untested) to\n  ``zope.app.appsetup``, to which we added a test.\n\n3.5.1 (2007-09-27)\n==================\n\n- rebump to replace faulty egg\n\n3.5.0\n=====\n\n- initial documented release\n\n- moved core components from ``zope.app.error`` to this package.\n",
