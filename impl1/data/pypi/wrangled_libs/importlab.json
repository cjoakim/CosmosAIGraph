  "description": "\nimportlab\n---------\n\nimportlab is a library for python that automatically infers dependencies\nand calculates a dependency graph. it can perform dependency ordering of\na set of files, including cycle detection.\n\nimportlab's main use case is to work with static analysis tools that\nprocess one file at a time, ensuring that a file's dependencies are\nanalysed before it is.\n\n(this is not an official google product.)\n\nlicense\n-------\n\napache 2.0\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nimportlab can be installed from pip\n\n::\n\n    pip install importlab\n\nto check out and install the latest source code\n\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/google/importlab.git\n    cd importlab\n    python setup.py install\n\nusage\n-----\n\nimportlab is primarily intended to be used as a library. it takes one or\nmore python files as arguments, and generates an import graph, typically\nused to process files in dependency order.\n\nit is currently integrated into\n`pytype <https://github.com/google/pytype>`__\n\ncommand-line tool\n-----------------\n\nimportlab ships with a small command-line tool, also called\n``importlab``, which can display some information about a project's\nimport graph.\n\n::\n\n    usage: importlab [-h] [--tree] [--unresolved] [filename [filename ...]]\n\n    positional arguments:\n      filename              input file(s)\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      --tree                display import tree.\n      --unresolved          display unresolved dependencies.\n\nroadmap\n-------\n\n-  ``makefile`` generation, to take advantage of ``make``'s incremental\n   update and parallel execution features\n\n-  integration with other static analysis tools\n",
