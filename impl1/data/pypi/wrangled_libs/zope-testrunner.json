check\n    zc.recipe.testrunner_'s documentation for details.\n\n\nvirtualenv-based projects\n-------------------------\n\n``pip install zope.testrunner`` and you'll get a ``zope-testrunner``\nscript.  run your tests with ::\n\n    zope-testrunner --test-path=path/to/your/source/tree\n\nyour source code needs to be available for the testrunner to import,\nso you need to run ``python setup.py install`` or ``pip install -e\n.`` into the same virtualenv_.\n\n\nsome useful command-line options to get you started\n===================================================\n\n-p              show a progress indicator\n-v              increase verbosity\n-c              colorize the output\n-t test         specify test names (one or more regexes)\n-m module       specify test modules (one or more regexes)\n-s package      specify test packages (one or more regexes)\n--list-tests    show names of tests instead of running them\n-x              stop on first error or failure\n-d, --pdb       enable post-mortem debugging of test failures\n--help          show *all* command-line options (there are many more!)\n\nfor example ::\n\n    bin/test -pvc -m test_foo -t testbar\n\nruns all testbar tests from a module called test_foo.py.\n\nwriting tests\n=============\n\n``zope.testrunner`` expects to find your tests inside your package\ndirectory, in a subpackage or module named ``tests``.  test modules\nin a test subpackage should be named ``test*.py``.\n\n.. tip::\n\n    you can change these assumptions with ``--tests-pattern`` and\n    ``--test-file-pattern`` test runner options.\n\ntests themselves should be classes inheriting from\n``unittest.testcase``, and if you wish to use doctests, please tell\nthe test runner where to find them and what options to use for them\nin by supplying a function named ``test_suite``.\n\nexample::\n\n    import unittest\n    import doctest\n\n    class testarithmetic(unittest.testcase):\n\n        def test_two_plus_two(self):\n            self.assertequal(2 + 2, 4)\n\n\n    def doctest_string_formatting():\n        \"\"\"test python string formatting\n\n            >>> print('{} + {}'.format(2, 2))\n            2 + 2\n\n        \"\"\"\n\n    def test_suite():\n        return unittest.testsuite([\n            unittest.defaulttestloader.loadtestsfromname(__name__),\n            doctest.doctestsuite(),\n            doctest.docfilesuite('../readme.txt',\n                                 optionflags=doctest.ellipsis),\n        ])\n\n\n\ntest grouping\n=============\n\nin addition to per-package and per-module filtering, zope.testrunner\nhas other mechanisms for grouping tests:\n\n* **layers** allow you to have shared setup/teardown code to be used\n  by a group of tests, that is executed only once, and not for each\n  test.  layers are orthogonal to the usual package/module structure\n  and are specified by setting the ``layer`` attribute on test\n  suites.\n\n* **levels** allow you to group slow-running tests and not run them\n  by default.  they're specified by setting the ``level`` attribute\n  on test suites to an int.\n\n\nother features\n==============\n\nzope.testrunner can profile your tests, measure test coverage,\ncheck for memory leaks, integrate with subunit_, shuffle the\ntest execution order, and run multiple tests in parallel.\n\n.. _buildout: https://buildout.readthedocs.io\n.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/\n.. _zc.recipe.testrunner: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.testrunner\n.. _subunit: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-subunit\n\n\n===========================\n zope.testrunner changelog\n===========================\n\n6.2.1 (2023-12-22)\n==================\n\n- work around python 3.12.1+ no longer calling ``starttest`` for skipped tests\n  (`#157 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/157>_`).\n\n\n6.2 (2023-11-08)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.12.\n\n- update code and tests to ``python-subunit >= 1.4.3`` thus requiring at least\n  this version.\n\n\n6.1 (2023-08-26)\n================\n\n- add preliminary support for python 3.12b4.\n  (`#149 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/149>`_)\n\n\n6.0 (2023-03-28)\n================\n\n- drop support for python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\n\n5.6 (2022-12-09)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.11.\n\n- inline a small part of ``random.random.shuffle`` which was deprecated in\n  python 3.9 and removed in 3.11 (`#119\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/119>`_).\n\n- don't trigger post mortem debugger for skipped tests. ( `#141\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/141>`_).\n\n\n5.5.1 (2022-09-07)\n==================\n\n- fix: let ``--at-level=level`` with ``level <= 0`` run the tests\n  at all levels (rather than at no level)\n  `#138 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/138>`_.\n\n\n5.5 (2022-06-24)\n================\n\n- use ``sys._current_frames`` (rather than ``threading.enumerate``)\n  as base for new thread detection, fixes\n  `#130 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/130>`_.\n\n- new option ``--gc-after-test``. it calls for a garbage collection\n  after each test and can be used to track down ``resourcewarning``s\n  and cyclic garbage.\n  with ``rv = gc.collect()``, ``!`` is output on verbosity level 1 when\n  ``rv`` is non zero (i.e. when cyclic structures have been released),\n  ``[``*rv*``]`` on higher verbosity levels and\n  a detailed cyclic garbage analysis on verbosity level 4+.\n  for details, see\n  `#133 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/133>`_.\n\n- allow the filename for the logging configuration to be specified\n  via the envvar ``zope_testrunner_log_ini``.\n  if not defined, the configuration continues to be locked for\n  in file ``log.ini`` of the current working directory.\n  remember the logging configuration file in envvar\n  ``zope_testrunner_log_ini`` to allow spawned child processes\n  to recreate the logging configuration.\n  for details, see\n  `#134 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/134>`_.\n\n\n5.4.0 (2021-11-19)\n==================\n\n- improve ``--help`` documentation for ``--package-path`` option\n  (`#121 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/121>`_).\n\n- do not disable existing loggers during logsupport initialization\n  (`#120 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/120>`_).\n\n- fix tests with testtools >= 2.5.0 (`#125\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/125>`_).\n\n- add support for python 3.10.\n\n\n5.3.0 (2021-03-17)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.9.\n\n- fix `package init file missing` warning\n  (`#112 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/112>`_).\n\n- make standard streams provide a `buffer` attribute on python 3 when using\n  `--buffer` or testing under subunit.\n\n\n5.2 (2020-06-29)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.8.\n\n- when a layer is run in a subprocess, read its stderr in a thread to avoid\n  a deadlock if its stderr output (containing failing and erroring test ids)\n  overflows the capacity of a pipe (`#105\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/105>`_).\n\n\n5.1 (2019-10-19)\n================\n\n- recover more gracefully when layer setup or teardown fails, producing\n  useful subunit output.\n\n- prevent a spurious warning from the ``--require-unique`` option if the\n  ``--module`` option was not used.\n\n- add optional buffering of standard output and standard error during tests,\n  requested via the ``--buffer`` option or enabled by default for subunit.\n\n- fix incorrect failure counts in per-layer summary output, broken in 4.0.1.\n\n\n5.0 (2019-03-19)\n================\n\n- fix test failures and deprecation warnings occurring when using python 3.8a1.\n  (`#89 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/89>`_)\n\n- drop support for python 3.4.\n\n\n4.9.2 (2018-11-24)\n==================\n\n- fix ``typeerror: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'``\n  running tests in parallel on python 3. see `issue 80\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/80>`_.\n\n\n4.9.1 (2018-11-21)\n==================\n\n- fix assertionerror in _dummythread.isalive on python 3 (`#81\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/81>`_).\n\n\n4.9 (2018-10-05)\n================\n\n- drop support for python 3.3.\n\n- add support for python 3.7.\n\n- enable test coverage reporting on coveralls.io and in tox.ini.\n\n- host documentation at https://zopetestrunner.readthedocs.io\n\n- remove untested support for the ``--pychecker`` option. see\n  `issue 63 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/63>`_.\n\n- update the command line interface to use ``argparse`` instead of\n  ``optparse``. see `issue 61\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/61>`_.\n\n- use ipdb instead of pdb for post-mortem debugging if available\n  (`#10 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/10>`_).\n\n- add a --require-unique option to check for duplicate test ids. see\n  `lp #682771\n  <https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/682771>`_.\n\n- reintroduce optional support for ``subunit``, now with support for both\n  version 1 and version 2 of its protocol.\n\n- handle string in exception values when formatting chained exceptions.\n  (`#74 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/74>`_)\n\n\n4.8.1 (2017-11-12)\n==================\n\n- enable ``deprecationwarning`` earlier, when discovering test\n  modules. this lets warnings that are raised on import (such as those\n  produced by ``zope.deprecation.moved``) be reported. see `issue 57\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/57>`_.\n\n\n4.8.0 (2017-11-10)\n==================\n\n- automatically enable ``deprecationwarning`` when running tests. this\n  is recommended by the python core developers and matches the\n  behaviour of the ``unittest`` module. this can be overridden with\n  python command-line options (``-w``) or environment variables\n  (``pythonwarnings``). see `issue 54\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/54>`_.\n\n4.7.0 (2017-05-30)\n==================\n\n- drop all support for ``subunit``.\n\n\n4.6.0 (2016-12-28)\n==================\n\n- make the ``subunit`` support purely optional: applications which have\n  been getting the dependencies via ``zope.testrunner`` should either add\n  ``zope.testrunner[subunit]`` to their ``install_requires`` or else\n  depend directly on ``python-subunit``.\n\n- new option ``--ignore-new-thread=<regexp>`` to suppress \"new thread(s)\"\n  warnings.\n\n- support python 3.6.\n\n\n4.5.1 (2016-06-20)\n==================\n\n- fixed: using the ``-j`` option to run tests in multiple processes\n  caused tests that used the ``multiprocessing`` package to hang\n  (because the testrunner replaced ``sys.stdin`` with an unclosable\n  object).\n\n- drop conditional dependency on ``unittest2`` (redundant after dropping\n  support for python 2.6).\n\n\n4.5.0 (2016-05-02)\n==================\n\n- stop tests for all layers when test fails/errors when started with\n  -x/--stop-on-error\n  (`#37 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/37>`_).\n\n- drop support for python 2.6 and 3.2.\n\n\n4.4.10 (2015-11-10)\n===================\n\n- add support for python 3.5\n  (`#31 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/31>`_).\n\n- insert extra paths (from ``--path``) to the front of sys.argv\n  (`#32 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/32>`_).\n\n\n4.4.9 (2015-05-21)\n==================\n\n- when using ``-j``, parallelize all the tests, including the first test layer\n  (`#28 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/28>`_).\n\n\n4.4.8 (2015-05-01)\n==================\n\n- support skipped tests in subunit output\n  (`#25 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/25>`_).\n\n- more efficient test filtering\n  (`#26 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/26>`_).\n\n\n4.4.7 (2015-04-02)\n==================\n\n- work around a bug in pypy3's curses module\n  (`#24 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/24>`_).\n\n\n4.4.6 (2015-01-21)\n==================\n\n- restore support for instance-based test layers that regressed in 4.4.5\n  (`#20 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/pull/20>`_).\n\n\n4.4.5 (2015-01-06)\n==================\n\n- sort related layers close to each other to reduce the number of unnecessary\n  teardowns (fixes `#14\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/14>`_).\n\n- run the unit test layer first (fixes `lp #497871\n  <https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.testrunner/+bug/497871>`__).\n\n\n4.4.4 (2014-12-27)\n==================\n\n- when looking for the right location of test code, start with longest\n  location paths first. this fixes problems with nested code locations.\n\n\n4.4.3 (2014-03-19)\n==================\n\n- added support for python 3.4.\n\n\n4.4.2 (2014-02-22)\n==================\n\n- drop support for python 3.1.\n\n- fix post-mortem debugging when a non-printable exception happens\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/8).\n\n\n4.4.1 (2013-07-10)\n==================\n\n- updated ``boostrap.py`` to version 2.2.\n\n- fix nondeterministic test failures on python 3.3\n\n- tear down layers after ``post_mortem`` debugging is finished.\n\n- fix tests that write to source directory, it might be read-only.\n\n\n4.4.0 (2013-06-06)\n==================\n\n- fix tests selection when the negative \"!\" pattern is used several times\n  (lp #1160965)\n\n- moved tests into a 'tests' subpackage.\n\n- made ``python -m zope.testrunner`` work again.\n\n- support 'skip' feature of unittest2 (which became the new unittest in python\n  2.7).\n\n- better diagnostics when communication with subprocess fails\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/5).\n\n- do not break subprocess execution when the test suite changes the working\n  directory (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/6).\n\n- count test module import errors as errors (lp #1026576).\n\n\n4.3.3 (2013-03-03)\n==================\n\n- running layers in sub-processes did not use to work when run via\n  ``python setup.py ftest`` since it tried to run setup.py with all the\n  command line options. it now detects ``setup.py`` runs and we run the test\n  runner directly.\n\n\n4.3.2 (2013-03-03)\n==================\n\n- fix ``skiplayers`` class in cases where the distribution specifies a\n  ``test_suite`` value.\n\n\n4.3.1 (2013-03-02)\n==================\n\n- fixed a bug in the `ftest` command and added a test.\n\n- fixed a trivial test failure with python 3 of the previous release.\n\n\n4.3.0 (2013-03-02)\n==================\n\n- expose `ftest` distutils command via an entry point.\n\n- added tests for ``zope.testrunner.eggsupport``.\n\n\n4.2.0 (2013-02-12)\n==================\n\n- dropped use of 2to3, rewrote source code to be compatible with all python\n  versions.  introduced a dependency on `six`_.\n\n\n4.1.1 (2013-02-08)\n==================\n\n- dropped use of zope.fixers (lp: #1118877).\n\n- fixed tox test error reporting; fixed tests on pythons 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and\n  pypy 1.9.\n\n- fix --shuffle ordering on python 3.2 to be the same as it was on older python\n  versions.\n\n- fix --shuffle nondeterminism when multiple test layers are present.\n  note: this will likely change the order of tests for the same --shuffle-seed.\n\n- new option: --profile-directory.  use it in the test suite so that tests\n  executed by detox in parallel don't conflict.\n\n- use a temporary coverage directory in the test suite so that tests\n  executed by detox in parallel don't conflict.\n\n- fix --post-mortem (aka -d, --pdb) when a test module cannot be imported\n  or is invalid (lp #1119363).\n\n\n4.1.0 (2013-02-07)\n==================\n\n- replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.\n\n- dropped support for python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n- made startupfailure compatible with unittest.texttestrunner() (lp #1118344).\n\n\n4.0.4 (2011-10-25)\n==================\n\n- work around sporadic timing-related issues in the subprocess buffering\n  tests.  thanks to jonathan ballet for the patch!\n\n\n4.0.3 (2011-03-17)\n==================\n\n- added back support for python <= 2.6 which was broken in 4.0.2.\n\n\n4.0.2 (2011-03-16)\n==================\n\n- added back python 3 support which was broken in 4.0.1.\n\n- fixed `unexpected success`_ support by implementing the whole concept.\n\n- added support for the new __pycache__ directories in python 3.2.\n\n\n4.0.1 (2011-02-21)\n==================\n\n- lp #719369: an `unexpected success`_ (concept introduced in python 2.7) is\n  no longer handled as success but as failure. this is a workaround. the\n  whole unexpected success concept might be implemented later.\n\n.. _`unexpected success`: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/unittest2.shtml#more-skipping\n\n\n4.0.0 (2010-10-19)\n==================\n\n- show more information about layers whose setup fails (lp #638153).\n\n\n4.0.0b5 (2010-07-20)\n====================\n\n- update fix for lp #221151 to a spelling compatible with python 2.4.\n\n- timestamps are now always included in subunit output (r114849).\n\n- lp #591309: fix a crash when subunit reports test failures containing\n  utf8-encoded data.\n\n\n4.0.0b4 (2010-06-23)\n====================\n\n- package as a zipfile to work around python 2.4 distutils bug (no\n  feature changes or bugfixes in ``zope.testrunner`` itself).\n\n\n4.0.0b3 (2010-06-16)\n====================\n\n- lp #221151: keep ``unittest.testcase.shortdescription`` happy by supplying\n  a ``_testmethoddoc`` attribute.\n\n- lp #595052: keep the distribution installable under python 2.4:  its\n  distutils appears to munge the empty ``__init__.py`` file in the\n  ``foo.bar`` egg used for testing into a directory.\n\n- lp #580083: fix the ``bin/test`` script to run only tests from\n  ``zope.testrunner``.\n\n- lp #579019: when layers were run in parallel, their teardown was\n  not called. additionally, the first layer which was run in the main\n  thread did not have its teardown called either.\n\n\n4.0.0b2 (2010-05-03)\n====================\n\n- having 'sampletests' in the manifest.in gave warnings, but doesn't actually\n  seem to include any more files, so i removed it.\n\n- moved zope.testing.exceptions to zope.testrunner.exceptions. now\n  zope.testrunner no longer requires zope.testing except for when running\n  its own tests.\n\n\n4.0.0b1 (2010-04-29)\n====================\n\n- initial release of the testrunner from zope.testrunner as its own module.\n  (previously it was part of zope.testing.)\n\n\n.. _six:
