(only when `manifold_par=tbb` is enabled)\n- [`gtest`](https://github.com/google/googletest/): google test library (only when test is enabled, i.e. `manifold_test=on`)\n\nother dependencies:\n- [`clipper2`](https://github.com/angusjohnson/clipper2): provides our 2d subsystem\n- [`quickhull`](https://github.com/akuukka/quickhull): 3d convex hull algorithm.\n\n## what's here\n\nthis library is fast with guaranteed manifold output. as such you need manifold meshes as input, which this library can create using constructors inspired by the openscad api, as well as more advanced features like smoothing and signed-distance function (sdf) level sets. you can also pass in your own mesh data, but you'll get an error status if the imported mesh isn't manifold. various automated repair tools exist online for fixing non manifold models, usually for 3d printing.\n\nthe most significant contribution here is a guaranteed-manifold [mesh boolean](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/wiki/manifold-library#mesh-boolean) algorithm, which i believe is the first of its kind. if you know of another, please open a discussion - a mesh boolean algorithm robust to edge cases has been an open problem for many years. likewise, if the boolean here ever fails you, please submit an issue! this boolean forms the basis of a cad kernel, as it allows simple shapes to be combined into more complex ones.\n\nto aid in speed, this library makes extensive use of parallelization, generally through nvidia's thrust library. you can switch between the tbb, and serial c++ backends by setting a cmake flag. not everything is so parallelizable, for instance a [polygon triangulation](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/wiki/manifold-library#polygon-triangulation) algorithm is included which is serial. even if compiled with parallel backend, the code will still fall back to the serial version of the algorithms if the problem size is small. the wasm build is serial-only for now, but still fast.\n\n> note: omp and cuda backends are now removed\n\nlook in the [samples](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/tree/master/samples) directory for examples of how to use this library to make interesting 3d models. you may notice that some of these examples bare a certain resemblance to my openscad designs on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/emmett), which is no accident. much as i love openscad, my library is dramatically faster and the code is more flexible.\n\n## building\n\nonly cmake, a c++ compiler, and python are required to be installed and set up to build this library (it has been tested with gcc, llvm, msvc). however, a variety of optional dependencies can bring in more functionality, see below.\n\nbuild and test (ubuntu or similar):\n```\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/elalish/manifold.git\ncd manifold\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -dcmake_build_type=release -dbuild_shared_libs=on .. && make\ntest/manifold_test\n```\n\ncmake flags (usage e.g. `-dmanifold_debug=on`):\n- `manifold_jsbind=[off, <on>]`: build js binding when using emscripten.\n- `manifold_cbind=[<off>, on]`: build c ffi binding.\n- `manifold_pybind=[off, <on>]`: build python binding.\n- `manifold_par=[<none>, tbb]`: provides multi-thread parallelization, requires `libtbb-dev` if `tbb` backend is selected.\n- `manifold_export=[<off>, on]`: enables glb export of 3d models from the tests, requires `libassimp-dev`.\n- `manifold_debug=[<off>, on]`: enables internal assertions and exceptions.\n- `manifold_test=[off, <on>]`: build unittests.\n- `tracy_enable=[<off>, on]`: enable integration with tracy profiler. \n  see profiling section below.\n- `build_test_cgal=[<off>, on]`: builds a cgal-based performance [comparison](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/tree/master/extras), requires `libcgal-dev`.\n\noffline building:\n- `fetchcontent_source_dir_glm`: path to glm source.\n- `fetchcontent_source_dir_googletest`: path to googletest source.\n- `fetchcontent_source_dir_thrust`: path to nvidia thrust source.\n\nthe build instructions used by our ci are in [manifold.yml](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/blob/master/.github/workflows/manifold.yml), which is a good source to check if something goes wrong and for instructions specific to other platforms, like windows.\n\n### wasm\n\n> note that we have only tested emscripten version 3.1.45. it is known that\n  3.1.48 has some issues compiling manifold.\n\nto build the js wasm library, first install nodejs and set up emscripten:\n\n(on mac):\n```\nbrew install nodejs\nbrew install emscripten\n```\n(on linux):\n```\nsudo apt install nodejs\ngit clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git\ncd emsdk\n./emsdk install latest\n./emsdk activate latest\nsource ./emsdk/emsdk_env.sh\n```\nthen build:\n```\ncd manifold\nmkdir buildwasm\ncd buildwasm\nemcmake cmake -dcmake_build_type=release .. && emmake make\nnode test/manifold_test.js\n```\n\n### python\n\nthe cmake script will build the python binding `manifold3d` automatically. to\nuse the extension, please add `$build_dir/bindings/python` to your `pythonpath`, where\n`$build_dir` is the build directory for cmake. examples using the python binding\ncan be found in `bindings/python/examples`. to see exported samples, run:\n```\nsudo apt install pkg-config libpython3-dev python3 python3-distutils python3-pip\npip install trimesh\npython3 run_all.py -e\n```\n\nrun the following code in the interpreter for\npython binding documentation:\n\n```\n>>> import manifold3d\n>>> help(manifold3d)\n```\n\nfor more detailed documentation, please refer to the c++ api.\n\n## contributing\n\ncontributions are welcome! a lower barrier contribution is to simply make a pr that adds a test, especially if it repros an issue you've found. simply name it prepended with disabled_, so that it passes the ci. that will be a very strong signal to me to fix your issue. however, if you know how to fix it yourself, then including the fix in your pr would be much appreciated!\n\n## profiling\n\nthere is now basic support for the [tracy profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) for our tests.\nto enable tracing, compile with `-dtracy_enable=on` cmake option, and run the test with tracy server running.\n\n## about the author\n\nthis library was started by [emmett lalish](https://elalish.blogspot.com/). i am currently a google employee and this is my 20% project, not an official google project. at my day job i'm the maintainer of [\\<model-viewer\\>](https://modelviewer.dev/). i was the first employee at a 3d video startup, [omnivor](https://www.omnivor.io/), and before that i worked on 3d printing at microsoft, including [3d builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab). originally an aerospace engineer, i started at a small darpa contractor doing seedling projects, one of which became [sea hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sea_hunter). i earned my doctorate from the university of washington in control theory and published some [papers](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/75011026_emmett_lalish).\n",
