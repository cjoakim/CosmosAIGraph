  "description": "introduction\n============\n\nbaron is a full syntax tree (fst) library for python. by opposition to an [ast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abstract_syntax_tree) which\ndrops some syntax information in the process of its creation (like empty lines,\ncomments, formatting), a fst keeps everything and guarantees the operation\n<code>fst\\_to\\_code(code\\_to\\_fst(source\\_code)) == source\\_code</code>.\n\nroadmap\n=======\n\ncurrent roadmap is as boring as needed:\n\n* bug fixs\n* new small features (walker pattern, maybe code generation) and performance improvement.\n\ninstallation\n============\n\n    pip install baron\n\nbasic usage\n===========\n\n```python\nfrom baron import parse, dumps\n\nfst = parse(source_code_string)\nsource_code_string == dumps(fst)\n```\n\nunless you want to do low level things, **use\n[redbaron](https://github.com/pycqa/redbaron) instead of using baron\ndirectly**. think of baron as the \"bytecode of python source code\" and redbaron\nas some sort of usable layer on top of it.\n\nif you don't know what baron is or don't understand yet why it might be\nuseful for you, read the [\u00ab\u00a0why is this important?\u00a0\u00bb section](#why-is-this-important).\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\nbaron documentation is available on [read the docs](http://baron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\ncontributing\n============\n\nif you want to implement new grammar elements for newer python versions, here\nare the documented steps for that:\nhttps://github.com/pycqa/baron/blob/master/add_new_grammar.md\n\nalso note that reviewing most grammar modifications takes several hours of\nadvanced focusing (we can't really afford bugs here) so don't despair if you pr\nseems to be hanging around, sorry for that :/\n\nand thanks in advance for your work!\n\nfinancial support\n=================\n\nbaron and redbaron are a very advanced piece of engineering that requires a lot\nof time of concentration to work on. until the end of 2018, the development\nhas been a full volunteer work mostly done by [bram](https://github.com/psycojoker),\nbut now, to reach the next level and bring those projects to the stability and\nquality you expect, we need your support.\n\nyou can join our contributors and sponsors on our transparent\n[opencollective](https://opencollective.com/redbaron), every contribution will\ncount and will be mainly used to work on the projects stability and quality but\nalso on continuing, on the side, the r&d side of those projects.\n\nour supporters\n--------------\n\n\n[![badge with number of supporters at tier i like this, keep going!](https://opencollective.com/redbaron/tiers/i-like-this,-keep-going!/badge.svg)\n![badge with number of supporters at tier it looks cool!](https://opencollective.com/redbaron/tiers/it-looks-cool!/badge.svg)\n![badge with number of supporters at tier oh god, that saved me so much time!](https://opencollective.com/redbaron/tiers/oh-god,-that-saved-me-so-much-time!/badge.svg)](https://opencollective.com/redbaron/tiers/)\n\n\nwhy is this important?\n======================\n\nthe usage of a fst might not be obvious at first sight so let's consider a\nseries of problems to illustrate it. let's say that you want to write a program that will:\n\n* rename a variable in a source file... without clashing with things that are not a variable (example: stuff inside a string)\n* inline a function/method\n* extract a function/method from a series of line of code\n* split a class into several classes\n* split a file into several modules\n* convert your whole code base from one orm to another\n* do custom refactoring operation not implemented by ide/rope\n* implement the class browser of smalltalk for python (the whole one where you can edit the code of the methods, not just showing code)\n\nit is very likely that you will end up with the awkward feeling of writing\nclumpsy weak code that is very likely to break because you didn't thought about\nall the annoying special cases and the formatting keeps bothering you. you may\nend up playing with [ast.py](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) until\nyou realize that it removes too much information to be suitable for those\nsituations. you will probably ditch this task as simply too complicated and\nreally not worth the effort. you are missing a good abstraction that will take\ncare of all of the code structure and formatting for you so you can concentrate\non your task.\n\nthe fst tries to be this abstraction. with it you can now work on a tree which\nrepresents your code with its formatting. moreover, since it is the exact\nrepresentation of your code, modifying it and converting it back to a string\nwill give you back your code only modified where you have modified the tree.\n\nsaid in another way, what i'm trying to achieve with baron is a paradigm change in\nwhich writing code that will modify code is now a realist task that is worth\nthe price (i'm not saying a simple task, but a realistic one: it's still a\ncomplex task).\n\nother\n-----\n\nhaving a fst (or at least a good abstraction build on it) also makes it easier\nto do code generation and code analysis while those two operations are already\nquite feasible (using [ast.py](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) \nand a templating engine for example).\n\nsome technical details\n======================\n\nbaron produces a fst in the form of json (and by json i mean python lists\nand dicts that can be dumped into json) for maximum interoperability.\n\nbaron fst is quite similar to python ast with some modifications to be more\nintuitive to humans, since python ast has been made for cpython interpreter.\n\nsince playing directly with json is a bit raw i'm going to build an abstraction\non top of it that will looks like beautifulsoup/jquery.\n\nstate of the project\n====================\n\ncurrently, baron has been tested on the top 100 projects and the fst converts\nback exactly into the original source code. so, it can be considered quite\nstable, but it is far away from having been battle tested.\n\nsince the project is very young and no one is already using it except my\nproject, i'm open to changes of the fst nodes but i will quickly become\nconservative once it gets some adoption and will probably accept to\nmodify it only once or twice in the future with clear indications on how to\nmigrate.\n\nbaron is supporting python 2 grammar and up to python 3.7 grammar.\n\ntests\n=====\nrun either `py.test tests/` or `nosetests` in the baron directory.\n\ncommunity\n=========\n\nyou can reach us on [irc.freenode.net#baron](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23baron) or [irc.freenode.net##python-code-quality](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23python-code-quality).\n\ncode of conduct\n===============\n\nas a member of [pycqa](https://github.com/pycqa), baron follows its [code of conduct](http://meta.pycqa.org/en/latest/code-of-conduct.html).\n\nmisc\n====\n[old blog post announcing the project.](http://worlddomination.be/blog/2013/the-baron-project-part-1-what-and-why.html) not that much up to date.\n\n\nchangelog\n=========\n\n0.10.1

broken\n  parsing, see https://github.com/pycqa/baron/issues/87\n- around 35-40% to 75% parsing speed improvment on big files by duncf\n  https://github.com/pycqa/baron/pull/99\n\n0.6.5 (2017-01-26)\n------------------\n\n- fix previous regression fix was broken\n\n0.6.4 (2017-01-14)\n------------------\n\n- fix regression in case a comment follow the \":\" of a if/def/other\n\n0.6.3 (2017-01-02)\n------------------\n\n- group formatting at start of file or preceded by space with comment\n\n0.6.2 (2016-03-18)\n------------------\n\n- fix race condition when generating parser cache file\n- make all user-facing errors inherit from the same baronerror class\n- fix: dotted_name and float_exponant_complex were missing from\n  nodes_rendering_order\n\n0.6.1 (2015-01-31)\n------------------\n\n- fix: the string was having a greedy behavior on grouping the string tokens\n  surrounding it (for string chains), this ends up creating an inconsistancy in\n  the way string was grouped in general\n- fix: better number parsing handling, everything isn't fixed yet\n- make all (expected) errors inherit from the same baronerror class\n- fix: parsing fails correctly if a quoted string is not closed\n\n0.6 (2014-12-11)\n----------------\n\n- fst structure modification: def_argument_tuple is no more and all arguments\n  now have a coherent structure:\n  * def_argument node name attribute has been renamed to target, like in assign\n  * target attribute now points to a dict, not to a string\n  * old name -> string are now target -> name_node\n  * def_argument_tuple is now a def_argument where target points to a tuple\n  * this specific tuple will only has name and comma and tuple members (no more\n    def_argument for name)\n- new node: long, before int and long where merged but that was causing problems\n\n0.5 (2014-11-10)\n----------------\n\n- rename \"funcdef\" node to \"def\" node to be way more intuitive.\n\n0.4 (2014-09-29)\n----------------\n\n- new rendering type in the nodes_rendering_order dictionary: string. this\n  remove an ambiguity where a key could be pointing to a dict or a string, thus\n  forcing third party tools to do guessing.\n\n0.3.1 (2014-09-04)\n------------------\n\n- setup.py wasn't working if wheel wasn't used because the changelog file\n  wasn't included in the manifest.in\n\n0.3 (2014-08-21)\n----------------\n\n- path becomes a simple list and is easier to deal with\n- bounding box allows you to know the left most and right most position\n  of a node see https://baron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#bounding-box\n- redbaron is classified as supporting python3\n  https://github.com/pycqa/baron/pull/51\n- ensure than when a key is a string, it's empty value is an empty string and\n  not none to avoid breaking libs that use introspection to guess the type of\n  the key\n- key renaming in the fst: \"delimiteur\" -> \"delimiter\"\n- name_as_name and dotted_as_name node don't have the \"as\" key anymore as it\n  was useless (it can be deduce from the state of the \"target\" key)\n- dotted_name node doesn't exist anymore, its existance was unjustified. in\n  import, from_import and decorator node, it has been replaced from a key to a\n  dict (with only a list inside of it) to a simple list.\n- dumps now accept a strict boolean argument to check the validity of the fst\n  on dumping, but this isn't that much a public feature and should probably be\n  changed of api in the futur\n- name_as_name and dotted_as_name empty value for target is now an empty string\n  and not none since this is a string type key\n- boundingbox now includes the newlines at the end of a node\n- all raised exceptions inherit from a common base exception to ease try/catch\n  constructions\n- position's left and right functions become properties and thus\n  attributes\n- position objects can be compared to other position objects or any\n  iterables\n- make_position and make_bounding_box functions are deleted in favor of\n  always using the corresponding class' constructor\n\n0.2 (2014-06-11)\n----------------\n\n- baron now provides documentation on https://baron.readthedocs.io\n- feature: baron now run in python3 (*but* doesn't implement the full python3\n  grammar yet) by pierre penninckx https://github.com/ibizaman\n- feature: drop the usage of ast.py to find print_function, this allow any\n  version of python to parse any other version of python also by pierre\n  penninckx\n- fix: rare bug where a comment end up being confused as an indentation level\n- 2 new helpers: show_file and show_node, see https://baron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#show-file\n  and https://baron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#show-node\n- new dictionary that provides the informations on how to render a fst node:\n  nodes_rendering_order see https://baron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#rendering-the-fst\n- new utilities to find a node, see https://baron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#locate-a-node\n- new generic class that provide templates to work on the fst see\n  https://baron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#rendering-the-fst\n\n0.1.3 (2014-04-13)\n------------------\n\n- set sugar syntaxic notation wasn't handled by the dumper (apparently no one\n  use this on pypi top 100)\n\n0.1.2 (2014-04-08)\n------------------\n\n- baron.dumps now accept a single fst node, it was only working with a list of\n  fst nodes\n- don't add a endl node at the end if not present in the input string\n- de-uniformise call_arguments and function_arguments node, this is just\n  creating more problems that anything else\n- fix https://github.com/pycqa/redbaron/issues/4\n- fix the fact that baron can't parse \"{1,}\" (but \"{1}\" is working)\n\n0.1.1 (2014-03-23)\n------------------\n\n- it appears that i don't know how to write manifest.in correctly\n\n\n0.1 (2014-03-22)\n----------------\n\n- init\n\n\n",
