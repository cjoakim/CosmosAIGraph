  "description": "===============================================================\ndevpi-client: manage devpi-server, python packaging and testing\n===============================================================\n\nthe ``devpi`` command line tool is typically used in conjunction\nwith `devpi-server <https://pypi.org/project/devpi-server/>`_.\nit allows to upload, test and install packages from devpi indexes.\n\nsee https://doc.devpi.net for quickstart and more documentation.\n\nsupport\n=======\n\nif you find a bug, use the `issue tracker at github`_.\n\nfor general questions use `github discussions`_ or the `devpi-dev@python.org mailing list`_.\n\nfor support contracts and paid help contact ``mail at pyfidelity.com``.\n\n.. _issue tracker at github: https://github.com/devpi/devpi/issues/\n.. _devpi-dev@python.org mailing list: https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/devpi-dev.python.org/\n.. _github discussions: https://github.com/devpi/devpi/discussions\n\n\n\n=========\nchangelog\n=========\n\n\n\n\n.. towncrier release notes start\n\n7.0.2 (2023-10-19)\n==================\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n- fix #992: fix error added in 6.0.4 when old authentication data from before 6.x exists.\n\n\n7.0.1 (2023-10-15)\n==================\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n- fix #1005: use ``shutil.move`` instead of ``path.rename`` to move distribution after building to prevent cross-device link errors.\n\n- fix #1008: pass ``--no-isolation`` option to ``build`` when determining name/version for documentation.\n\n\n7.0.0 (2023-10-11)\n==================\n\ndeprecations and removals\n-------------------------\n\n- use ``build`` instead of deprecated ``pep517`` package.\n\n- removed dependency on py package.\n  plugins which expect py.path.local need to be adjusted to work with pathlib.path.\n\n- dropped support for python <= 3.6.\n\n\n\nother changes\n-------------\n\n- .. note::\n      potentially breaking fix #939: devpi-common 4.x now has custom legacy version parsing (non pep 440) after packaging >= 22.0 removed support. this might affect commands like ``devpi remove`` if used with version ranges. legacy versions were always and still are sorted before pep 440 compliant versions, but the ordering between legacy versions might be affected.\n\n- fix #946: output ``name==version`` instead of ``name-version`` for ``devpi list -v``.\n\n\n6.0.6 (2023-10-11)\n==================\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n- fix #997: directly use ``bdist``, ``sdist`` and ``wheel`` from ``pkginfo`` based on file extension instead of ``get_metadata``, as the latter does auto-detection on content which fails in some cases.\n\n- fix #1002: cleanup ``build`` directory before running sphinx to prevent build artifacts from being added to documentation zip.\n\n\n6.0.5 (2023-07-02)\n==================\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n- remember url when ``devpi use`` causes a 403, so one can use ``devpi login`` afterwards.\n\n- fix #978: quote username and password when adding to url.\n\n- fix #980: remove long deprecated backward compatibility for old pluggy versions to fix error with pluggy 1.1.0.\n\n",
