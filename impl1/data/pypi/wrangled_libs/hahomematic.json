  "description": "# hahomematic\n\n`hahomematic` is a python 3 (>= 3.11) module for [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to interact with [homematic](https://www.eq-3.com/products/homematic.html) and [homematicip](https://www.homematic-ip.com/en/start.html) devices. some other devices (f.ex. bosch, intertechno) might be supported as well.\n\nthis is intended to become the successor of [pyhomematic](https://github.com/danielperna84/pyhomematic).\n\nit can be installed by using the [custom_component](https://github.com/danielperna84/custom_homematic).\nnecessary installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/danielperna84/custom_homematic/wiki/installation).\n\n## project goal and features\n\n[pyhomematic](https://github.com/danielperna84/pyhomematic) has the requirement to manually add support for devices to make them usable in [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). `hahomematic` automatically create entities for each parameter on each channel on every device (if it not black listed). to achieve this, all paramsets (`values`) are fetched (and cached for quick successive startups).\n\non top of that it is possible to add custom entity-classes to implement more complex entities, if it makes sense for a device, much like the [devicetypes](https://github.com/danielperna84/pyhomematic/tree/master/pyhomematic/devicetypes) of [pyhomematic](https://github.com/danielperna84/pyhomematic). this will be needed for thermostats, lights, covers, climate, lock, siren etc..\n\nhelpers for automatic re-connecting after a restart of the ccu are provided as well.\n\n## requirements\n\ndue to a bug in previous version of the ccu2 / ccu3, `hahomematic` requires at least the following version for usage with homematicip devices:\n\n- ccu2: 2.53.27\n- ccu3: 3.53.26\n\nmore information about this bug can be found here: https://github.com/jens-maus/raspberrymatic/issues/843. other ccu-like platforms that leverage the buggy version of the `hmipserver` aren't supported as well.\n",
