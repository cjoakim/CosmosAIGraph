  "description": "# pysdl2\n\n[![tests](https://github.com/py-sdl/py-sdl2/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/py-sdl/py-sdl2/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml)\n![pypi - python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pysdl2)\n[![pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pysdl2.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysdl2)\n\npysdl2 is a pure python wrapper around the sdl2, sdl2\\_mixer, sdl2\\_image,\nsdl2\\_ttf, and sdl2\\_gfx libraries.\ninstead of relying on c code, it uses the built-in ctypes module to interface\nwith sdl2, and provides simple python classes and wrappers for common\nsdl2 functionality.\n\n## installation\n\npysdl2 is easy to install and integrate within your own projects.\nto install or update to the latest version, simply run one of the\nfollowing commands in a terminal:\n\n```bash\n# install latest stable version from pypi\npip install -u pysdl2\n\n# install latest development verion from github\npip install -u git+https://github.com/py-sdl/py-sdl2.git\n```\n\n**note**: if installing on python 3 on a computer where both python 2 and 3\nare installed, replace `pip` with `pip3` in the above commands.\n\n## requirements\n\nin order for pysdl2 to work, the binaries for sdl2 (and any sdl2 addon modules\nyou wish to use, e.g. sdl2\\_mixer) need to be installed on your system. on\nmacos, windows, and most x86 and arm64 distributions of linux, the recommended\nway to install the sdl2 binaries is via the `pysdl2-dll` package using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pysdl2-dll\n```\n\nthis will install pre-built binaries for all supported sdl2 libraries as\na python package, which pysdl2 will automatically load if available.\non systems not supported by `pysdl2-dll`, you can install the sdl2 binaries using\nyour system's package manager (which may be out of date), or alternatively\nbuild and install the latest versions yourself from source.\n\nthe current minimum supported versions for each library are listed below:\n\n* **sdl2** >= 2.0.5\n* **sdl2_mixer** >= 2.0.1 (for the `sdl2.sdlmixer` module)\n* **sdl2_ttf** >= 2.0.14 (for the `sdl2.sdlttf` module)\n* **sdl2_image** >= 2.0.1 (for the `sdl2.sdlimage` module)\n* **sdl2_gfx** >= 1.0.3 (for the `sdl2.sdlgfx` module)\n\n## documentation\n\nif you just started with sdl and pysdl2, it is strongly recommended\nthat you read through the tutorial of the documentation to learn the\nbasics. you can find the documentation at `doc/html` or online at\n<http://pysdl2.readthedocs.org>.\n\n## license\n\nthis library is given to the public domain. there are no licensing\nrestrictions. please see `doc/copying.rst` for further details.",
