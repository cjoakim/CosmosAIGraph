scipy has 80 distributions and the **fitter** class will scan all of them, call the fit function for you, ignoring those that fail or run forever and finally give you a summary of the best distributions in the sense of sum of the square errors. the best is to give an example::\n\n\n    from fitter import fitter\n    f = fitter(data)\n    f.fit()\n    # may take some time since by default, all distributions are tried\n    # but you call manually provide a smaller set of distributions \n    f.summary()\n\n\n.. image:: http://pythonhosted.org/fitter/_images/index-1.png\n    :target: http://pythonhosted.org/fitter/_images/index-1.png\n\n\nsee the `online <http://fitter.readthedocs.io/>`_ documentation for details.\n\n\ncontributors\n=============\n\n\nsetting up and maintaining fitter has been possible thanks to users and contributors.\nthanks to all:\n\n.. image:: https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=cokelaer/fitter\n    :target: https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/graphs/contributors\n\n\n\n\nchangelog\n~~~~~~~~~\n========= ==========================================================================\nversion   description\n========= ==========================================================================\n1.6.0     * for developers: uses pyproject.toml instead of setup.py\n          * fix progress bar fixing https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/74\n          * fix bic formula https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/77\n1.5.2     * pr https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/74 to fix logger\n1.5.1     * fixed regression putting back joblib\n1.5.0     * removed easydev and replaced by tqdm for progress bar\n          * progressbar from tqdm also allows replacement of joblib need\n1.4.1     * update timeout in docs from 10 to 30 seconds by @mpadge in \n            https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/47\n          * add kolmogorov-smirnov goodness-of-fit statistic by @lahdjirayhan in \n            https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/58\n          * switch branch from master to main\n1.4.0     * get_best function now returns the parameters as a dictionary \n            of parameter names and their values rather than just a list of\n            values (https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues/23) thanks to \n            contributor @kabirmdasraful\n          * accepting pr to fix progress bar issue reported in \n            https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/37\n1.3.0     * parallel process implemented https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/25\n            thanks to @arsenyinfo \n1.2.3     * remove vervose arguments in fitter class. using the logging module \n            instead\n          * the fitter.fit has now a progress bar\n          * add a standalone application called \u2026 fitter (see the doc)\n1.2.2     was not released\n1.2.1     adding new class called histfit (see documentation)\n1.2       * fixed the version. previous version switched from \n            1.0.9 to 1.1.11. to start a fresh version, we increase to 1.2.0\n          * merged pull request required by bioconda\n          * merged pull request related to implementation of \n            aic/bic/kl criteria (https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/19). \n            this also fixes https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues/9\n          * implement two functions to get all distributions, or a list of \n            common distributions to help users decreading computational time \n            (https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues/20). also added a faqs \n            section.\n          * travis tested python 3.6 and 3.7 (not 3.5 anymore)\n1.1       * fixed deprecated warning\n          * fitter is now in readthedocs at fitter.readthedocs.io\n1.0.9     * https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/8 and 11\n            pr https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/8\n1.0.6     * summary() now returns the dataframe (instead of printing it)\n1.0.5      https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues\n1.0.2     add manifest to fix missing source in the pypi repository.\n========= ==========================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n",
