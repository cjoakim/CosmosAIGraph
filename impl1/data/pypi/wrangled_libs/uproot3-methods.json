  "description": ".. inclusion-marker-1-5-do-not-remove\n\nthis package is typically used as a dependency for `uproot 3.x <https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot3>`__, to define methods on the classes that are automatically generated from root files. this includes histograms (th*) and physics objects like tlorentzvectors. the reason it's a separate library is so that we can add physics-specific functionality on a shorter timescale than we can update uproot 3 itself, which is purely an i/o package.\n\noccasionally, this library is used without uproot 3, as a way to make arrays of tlorentzvectors.\n\n**note:** this package is incompatible with ``awkward>=1.0`` and ``uproot>=4.0``! for lorentz vectors, use `vector <https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector>`__. since the versions of awkward array and uproot that this is compatible with are deprecated, **this library is deprecated** as well.\n\n.. inclusion-marker-2-do-not-remove\n\ninstallation\n============\n\ninstall uproot3-methods like any other python package:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install uproot3-methods               # maybe with sudo or --user, or in virtualenv\n\ndependencies:\n-------------\n\n- `numpy <https://scipy.org/install.html>`__ (1.13.1+)\n- `awkward array 0.x <https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-0.x>`__\n\n",
