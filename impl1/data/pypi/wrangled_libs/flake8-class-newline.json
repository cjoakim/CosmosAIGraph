  "description": "flake8 extension to lint for a method newline after a class definition\n===========================================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/alexveck/flake8-class-newline.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/alexveck/flake8-class-newline\n   :alt: build status\n\nusage\n-----\n\nif you are using flake8, you can install this package through pip.\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    pip install flake8-class-newline\n\nthis plugin is then automatically triggered when you run;\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    flake8\n\nit produces only 1 error type; \"cnl100 class definition does not have a new line.\"\n\nnote; documentation blocks (or docblocks) should be on the newline, they are therefore ignored by this plugin. see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#documentation-strings\n\n\nexample\n-----\n\npep8 says we should surround every class method with a single blank line. see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines\nhowever flake8 is ambiguous about the first method having a blank line above it.\n\nbasically;\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    class aclasswithoutanewline(object):\n        def a_method(self):\n            return 'a_value'\n\n    class aclasswithoutanewlineproperty(object):\n        @property\n        def a_method(self):\n            return 'a_value'\n\nor\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    class aclasswithanewline(object):\n\n        def a_method(self):\n            return 'a_value'\n\n    class aclasswithanewlineproperty(object):\n\n        @property\n        def a_method(self):\n            return 'a_value'\n\n\n\nthis plugin was made to enforce the latter.\n\nnote; properties of a class do not need a surrounding blank line, only methods.\n\nspecial notice\n-----\n\nthis package was inspired by flake8-quotes created by @zheller.\nthanks for the inspiration!\n\n\n",
