  "description": "axe-selenium-python\n====================\n\naxe-selenium-python integrates axe and selenium to enable automated web accessibility testing.\n\n**this version of axe-selenium-python is using axe-core@3.1.1.**\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-mpl%202.0-blue.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python/blob/master/license.txt\n   :alt: license\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/axe-selenium-python.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/axe-selenium-python/\n   :alt: pypi\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python.svg\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python\n   :alt: travis\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python/issues\n   :alt: issues\n.. image:: https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python\n   :target: https://dependabot.com\n   :alt: dependabot\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python?branch=master\n   :alt: coveralls\n\n\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\nyou will need the following prerequisites in order to use axe-selenium-python:\n\n- selenium >= 3.0.0\n- python 2.7 or 3.6\n- the appropriate driver for the browser you intend to use, downloaded and added to your path, e.g. geckodriver for firefox:\n\n  - `geckodriver <https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases>`_ downloaded and `added to your path <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40208051/selenium-using-python-geckodriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path#answer-40208762>`_\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nto install axe-selenium-python:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ pip install axe-selenium-python\n\n\nusage\n------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  from selenium import webdriver\n  from axe_selenium_python import axe\n\n  def test_google():\n      driver = webdriver.firefox()\n      driver.get(\"http://www.google.com\")\n      axe = axe(driver)\n      # inject axe-core javascript into page.\n      axe.inject()\n      # run axe accessibility checks.\n      results = axe.run()\n      # write results to file\n      axe.write_results(results, 'a11y.json')\n      driver.close()\n      # assert no violations are found\n      assert len(results[\"violations\"]) == 0, axe.report(results[\"violations\"])\n\nthe method ``axe.run()`` accepts two parameters: ``context`` and ``options``.\n\nfor more information on ``context`` and ``options``, view the `axe documentation here <https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/master/doc/api.md#parameters-axerun>`_.\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\nfork the repository and submit prs with bug fixes and enhancements;\ncontributions are very welcome.\n\nnode dependencies must be installed by running `npm install` inside the axe-selenium-python directory.\n\nyou can run the tests using\n`tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ tox\n\nresources\n---------\n\n- `issue tracker <http://github.com/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python/issues>`_\n- `code <http://github.com/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python/>`_\n- `pytest-axe <http://github.com/mozilla-services/pytest-axe/>`_\n\nchangelog\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nversion 2.1.5\n*************\n**breaking changes**:\n\n- the axe class method ``execute`` has been renamed to ``run`` to mirror the method in the axe-core api.\n\nversion 2.1.0\n**************\n- created package.json file to maintain axe-core dependency\n- replaced unit tests with more meaningful integration tests\n  - included a sample html file for integration tests\n\nversion 2.0.0\n**************\n- all functionalities that are not part of axe-core have been moved into a separate package, ``pytest-axe``. this includes:\n\n  - ``run_axe`` helper method\n  - ``get_rules`` axe class method\n  - ``run`` axe class method\n  - ``impact_included`` axe class method\n  - ``analyze`` axe class method.\n\nthe purpose of this change is to separate implementations that are specific to the mozilla firefox test engineering team, and leave the base ``axe-selenium-python`` package for a more broad use case. this package was modeled off of deque's java package, axe-selenium-java, and will now more closely mirror it.\n\nall functionalities can still be utilized when using ``axe-selenium-python`` in conjunction with ``pytest-axe``.\n\nversion 1.2.3\n**************\n- added the analyze method to the axe class. this method runs accessibility checks, and writes the json results to file based on the page url and the timestamp.\n- writing results to file can be enabled by setting the environment variable ``accessibility_reporting=true``. the files will be written to ``results/`` directory, which must be created if it does not already exist.\n- accessibility checks can be disabled by setting the environment variable ``accessibility_disabled=true``.\n\nversion 1.2.1\n**************\n- updated axe to ``axe-core@2.6.1``\n- modified impact_included class method to reflect changes to the axe api:\n- there are now only 3 impact levels: 'critical', 'serious', and 'minor'\n\nversion 1.0.0\n**************\n- updated usage examples in readme\n- added docstrings to methods lacking documentation\n- removed unused files\n\nversion 0.0.3\n**************\n- added run method to axe class to simplify the usage in existing test suites\n- run method includes the ability to set what impact level to test for: 'minor', 'moderate', 'severe', 'critical'\n\nversion 0.0.28\n****************\n- added selenium instance as a class attribute\n- changed file paths to os independent structure\n- fixed file read operations to use with keyword\n\n\nversion 0.0.21\n***************\n- fixed include of axe api file and references to it\n- updated readme\n\n\n",
