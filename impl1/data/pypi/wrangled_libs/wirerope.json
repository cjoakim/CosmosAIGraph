  "description": "wirerope\n========\n\nthe concepts:\n\n- `wirerope.rope.wirerope` is a wrapper interface for python callable.\n- custom `wirerope.wire.wire` class provides user-defined behavior.\n  a subclass of this class is working similar to a *decorator function* body.\n- a wire object is associated with a bound method.\n- rope is dispatching types.\n\n`wirerope.rope.wirerope` is the wrapper for callables. by wrapping a\nfunction with `wirerope` with a custom subclass of the `wirerope.wire.wire`\nclass, the wire object will be created by each function or bound method.\n\n`wire` is the most important part. the given class will be instantiated and\nbound to each function or bound method - which fits the concept of *instance\ncmethod* of human.\nfor example, when `f` is a free function or staticmethod, the wire also will\nbe a single object. when `f` is a method or property, wires will be created for\neach method owner object `self`. when `f` is a classmethod, wires will be\ncreated for each method owner class `cls`. yes, it will detect the owner\nand bound to it regardless of the calling type.\n\n`rope` is internal dispatcher. it will be helpful when creating a complex\nobject for decorated callable instead of simple callable feature.\n\n\nsee also\n--------\n\n- see [documentation](https://wirerope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - though it\n  is not yet written very well.\n- see `tests/test_wire.py` for simple example.\n- see [methodtools](https://github.com/youknowone/methodtools) for practical\n  example.\n",
