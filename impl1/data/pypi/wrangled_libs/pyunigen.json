  "description": "# pyunigen: bindings to the unigen almost uniform sampler\n\nthis directory provides python bindings to unigen on the c++ level,\ni.e. when importing pycryptosat, the cryptominisat solver becomes part of the\npython process itself.\n\n## installing\n\n```\npip install pyunigen\n```\n\n## compiling\nif you don't want to use the pip package, you can compile it as:\n\n```\napt-get install python-dev\ncd python\ngit clone https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat\ngit clone https://github.com/meelgroup/arjun\ngit clone https://github.com/meelgroup/approxmc\ncd ..\npython -m build\n```\nyou will then find the files under \"dist/\".\n\n## usage\n\nthe `pyunigen` module has one object, `sampler` that has two functions\n`sample` and `add_clause`.\n\nthe funcion `add_clause()` takes an iterable list of literals such as\n`[1, 2]` which represents the truth `1 or 2 = true`. for example,\n`add_clause([1])` sets variable `1` to `true`.\n\nthe function `sample()` samples the system of equations that have been added\nwith `add_clause()`:\n\n```\n>>> from pyunigen import sampler\n>>> c = sampler()\n>>> c.add_clause([1, 5])\n>>> c.add_clause([10, 11, 12])\n>>> cells, hashes, samples = c.sample(num=2, sampling_set=range(1,5))\n>>> print(\"there are approx. \", cells*2**hashes, \" solutions over the sampling set. samples: \", samples)\nthere are approx.  16  solutions over the sampling set. samples:  [[1, -2, 3, -4], [1, 2, -3, -4]]\n```\n\nthe return value is a tuple of cells and hashes. which gives how many solutions\nthere are, probabilistically approximately\n\nyou can give the following arguments to `counter`:\n* `seed` -- sets the random seed\n* `verbosity` -- sets the verbosity of the system (default = 0)\n* `epsilon` -- tolerance parameter, i.e. sets how approximate the returned count is. default = 0.8\n* `delta` -- confidence parameter, i.e. sets how probabilistically correct the returned count is. default = 0.20\n\n",
