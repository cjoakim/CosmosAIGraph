  "description": "# mlstacks: deploy your mlops infrastructure in minutes\n\n## \ud83c\udf30 in a nutshell: what is mlstacks?\n\n[mlstacks](https://mlstacks.zenml.io) is a\n[python package](https://pypi.org/project/mlstacks/) that allows you to quickly\nspin up mlops infrastructure using terraform. it is designed to be used with\n[zenml](https://zenml.io), but can be used with any mlops tool or platform.\n\nsimply write stack and component yaml specification files and deploy them using\nthe mlstacks cli. mlstacks will take care of the rest. we currently support\nmodular mlops stacks on aws, gcp and k3d (for local use).\n\n## \ud83d\udc77 why we built mlstacks\n\n[![maintained-by-zenml](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3348134/173032050-ad923313-f2ce-4583-b27a-afcaa8b355e2.png)](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml)\n\nwhen we first created [zenml](https://zenml.io) as an extensible mlops framework\nfor creating portable, production-ready mlops pipelines, we saw many of our\nusers having to deal with the pain of deploying infrastructure from scratch to\nrun these pipelines. the community consistently asked questions like:\n\n- how do i deploy tool x with tool y?\n- does a combination of tool x with y make sense?\n- isn't there an easy way to just try these stacks out to make an informed\n  decision?\n\nto address these questions, the zenml team presents you a series of\nterraform-based stacks to quickly provision popular combinations of mlops tools.\nthese stacks will be useful for you if:\n\n- you are at the start of your mlops journey, and would like to explore\n  different tools.\n- you are looking for guidelines for production-grade deployments.\n- you would like to run your mlops pipelines on your chosen\n  [zenml stack](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/understand-stacks).\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **do you use these tools or do you want to add one to your mlops stack?** at\nzenml, we are looking for design partnerships and collaboration to implement and\ndevelop these mlops stacks in a real-world setting.\n\nif you'd like to learn more, please\n[join our slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite/) and leave us a message!\n\n## \ud83e\udd13 learn more\n\n- try the\n  [quickstart example in the documentation](https://mlstacks.zenml.io/getting-started/quickstart)\n  to get started with mlstacks.\n- discover what you can configure with the different stacks in the\n  [stacks documentation](https://mlstacks.zenml.io/stacks/stack-specification).\n- learn about our cli commands in the\n  [cli documentation](https://mlstacks.zenml.io/reference/cli.md).\n\n## \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb acknowledgements\n\nthank you to the folks over at [fuzzy labs](https://www.fuzzylabs.ai/) for their\nsupport and contributions to this repository. also many thanks to\n[ali abbas jaffri](https://github.com/aliabbasjaffri) for several stimulating\ndiscussions around the architecture of this project.\n\nwe'd also like to acknowledge some of the cool inspirations for this project:\n\n- [fuseml](https://fuseml.github.io/)\n- [combinator.ml](https://combinator.ml/)\n- [building a ml platform from scratch](https://www.aporia.com/blog/building-an-ml-platform-from-scratch/)\n",
