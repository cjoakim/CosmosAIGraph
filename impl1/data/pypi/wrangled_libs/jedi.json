[`see\n  <https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?rev=kde%2f4.13>`_]\n- atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)\n- `gnome builder`_ (with support for gobject introspection)\n- gedit (gedi_)\n- wdb_ - web debugger\n- `eric ide`_\n- `ipython 6.0.0+ <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html>`_\n- `xonsh shell <https://xon.sh/contents.html>`_ has `jedi extension <https://xon.sh/xontribs.html#jedi>`_\n\nand many more!\n\nthere are a few language servers that use jedi:\n\n- `jedi-language-server <https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server>`_\n- `python-language-server <https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server>`_ (currently unmaintained)\n- `python-lsp-server <https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server>`_ (fork from python-language-server)\n- `anakin-language-server <https://github.com/muffinmad/anakin-language-server>`_\n\nhere are some pictures taken from jedi-vim_:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_complete.png\n\ncompletion for almost anything:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_function.png\n\ndocumentation:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_pydoc.png\n\n\nget the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_\n(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).\n\ndocs are available at `https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. pull requests with enhancements\nand/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. jedi uses `semantic versioning\n<https://semver.org/>`_.\n\nif you want to stay **up-to-date** with releases, please **subscribe** to this\nmailing list: https://groups.google.com/g/jedi-announce. to subscribe you can\nsimply send an empty email to ``jedi-announce+subscribe@googlegroups.com``.\n\nissues & questions\n==================\n\nyou can file issues and questions in the `issue tracker\n<https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/>`. alternatively you can also ask on\n`stack overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-jedi>`_ with\nthe label ``python-jedi``.\n\ninstallation\n============\n\n`check out the docs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.\n\nfeatures and limitations\n========================\n\njedi's features are listed here:\n`features <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_.\n\nyou can run jedi on python 3.6+ but it should also\nunderstand code that is older than those versions. additionally you should be\nable to use `virtualenvs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html#environments>`_\nvery well.\n\ntips on how to use jedi efficiently can be found `here\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html#recipes>`_.\n\napi\n---\n\nyou can find a comprehensive documentation for the\n`api here <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html>`_.\n\nautocompletion / goto / documentation\n-------------------------------------\n\nthere are the following commands:\n\n- ``jedi.script.goto``\n- ``jedi.script.infer``\n- ``jedi.script.help``\n- ``jedi.script.complete``\n- ``jedi.script.get_references``\n- ``jedi.script.get_signatures``\n- ``jedi.script.get_context``\n\nthe returned objects are very powerful and are really all you might need.\n\nautocompletion in your repl (ipython, etc.)\n-------------------------------------------\n\njedi is a dependency of ipython. autocompletion in ipython with jedi is\ntherefore possible without additional configuration.\n\nhere is an `example video <https://vimeo.com/122332037>`_ how repl completion\ncan look like.\nfor the ``python`` shell you can enable tab completion in a `repl\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/usage.html#tab-completion-in-the-python-shell>`_.\n\nstatic analysis\n---------------\n\nfor a lot of forms of static analysis, you can try to use\n``jedi.script(...).get_names``. it will return a list of names that you can\nthen filter and work with. there is also a way to list the syntax errors in a\nfile: ``jedi.script.get_syntax_errors``.\n\n\nrefactoring\n-----------\n\njedi supports the following refactorings:\n\n- ``jedi.script.inline``\n- ``jedi.script.rename``\n- ``jedi.script.extract_function``\n- ``jedi.script.extract_variable``\n\ncode search\n-----------\n\nthere is support for module search with ``jedi.script.search``, and project\nsearch for ``jedi.project.search``. the way to search is either by providing a\nname like ``foo`` or by using dotted syntax like ``foo.bar``. additionally you\ncan provide the api type like ``class foo.bar.bar``. there are also the\nfunctions ``jedi.script.complete_search`` and ``jedi.project.complete_search``.\n\ndevelopment\n===========\n\nthere's a pretty good and extensive `development documentation\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html>`_.\n\ntesting\n=======\n\nthe test suite uses ``pytest``::\n\n    pip install pytest\n\nif you want to test only a specific python version (e.g. python 3.8), it is as\neasy as::\n\n    python3.8 -m pytest\n\nfor more detailed information visit the `testing documentation\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/testing.html>`_.\n\nacknowledgements\n================\n\nthanks a lot to all the\n`contributors

(2023-10-02)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- python 3.12 support (thanks peter!)\n\n0.19.0 (2023-07-29)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- python 3.11 support\n- massive improvements in performance for ``interpreter`` (e.g. ipython) users.\n  this especially affects ``pandas`` users with large datasets.\n- add ``jedi.settings.allow_unsafe_interpreter_executions`` to make it easier\n  for ipython users to avoid unsafe executions.\n\n0.18.2 (2022-11-21)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- added dataclass-equivalent for attrs.define\n- find fixtures from pytest entrypoints; examples of pytest plugins installed\n  like this are pytest-django, pytest-sugar and faker.\n- fixed project.search, when a venv was involved, which is why for example\n  `:pyimport django.db` did not work in some cases in jedi-vim.\n- and many smaller bugfixes\n\n0.18.1 (2021-11-17)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- implict namespaces are now a separate types in ``name().type``\n- python 3.10 support\n- mostly bugfixes\n\n0.18.0 (2020-12-25)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- dropped python 2 and python 3.5\n- using ``pathlib.path()`` as an output instead of ``str`` in most places:\n  - ``project.path``\n  - ``script.path``\n  - ``definition.module_path``\n  - ``refactoring.get_renames``\n  - ``refactoring.get_changed_files``\n- functions with ``@property`` now return ``property`` instead of ``function``\n  in ``name().type``\n- started using annotations\n- better support for the walrus operator\n- project attributes are now read accessible\n- removed all deprecations\n\nthis is likely going to be the last minor release before 1.0.\n\n0.17.2 (2020-07-17)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- added an option to pass environment variables to ``environment``\n- ``project(...).path`` exists now\n- support for python 3.9\n- a few bugfixes\n\nthis will be the last release that supports python 2 and python 3.5.\n``0.18.0`` will be python 3.6+.\n\n0.17.1 (2020-06-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- django ``model`` meta class support\n- django manager support (completion on managers/querysets)\n- added django stubs to jedi, thanks to all contributors of the\n  `django stubs <https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs>`_ project\n- added ``syntaxerror.get_message``\n- python 3.9 support\n- bugfixes (mostly towards generics)\n\n0.17.0 (2020-04-14)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- added ``project`` support. this allows a user to specify which folders jedi\n  should work with.\n- added support for refactoring. the following refactorings have been\n  implemented: ``script.rename``, ``script.inline``,\n  ``script.extract_variable`` and ``script.extract_function``.\n- added ``script.get_syntax_errors`` to display syntax errors in the current\n  script.\n- added code search capabilities both for individual files and projects. the\n  new functions are ``project.search``, ``project.complete_search``,\n  ``script.search`` and ``script.complete_search``.\n- added ``script.help`` to make it easier to display a help window to people.\n  now returns pydoc information as well for python keywords/operators.  this\n  means that on the class keyword it will now return the docstring of python's\n  builtin function ``help('class')``.\n- the api documentation is now way more readable and complete. check it out\n  under https://jedi.readthedocs.io. a lot of it has been rewritten.\n- removed python 3.4 support\n- many bugfixes\n\nthis is likely going to be the last minor version that supports python 2 and\npython3.5. bugfixes will be provided in 0.17.1+. the next minor/major version\nwill probably be jedi 1.0.0.\n\n0.16.0 (2020-01-26)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- **added** ``script.get_context`` to get information where you currently are.\n- completions/type inference of **pytest fixtures**.\n- tensorflow, numpy and pandas completions should now be about **4-10x faster**\n  after the first time they are used.\n- dict key completions are working now. e.g. ``d = {1000: 3}; d[10`` will\n  expand to ``1000``.\n- completion for \"proxies\" works now. these are classes that have a\n  ``__getattr__(self, name)`` method that does a ``return getattr(x, name)``.\n  after loading them initially.\n- goto on a function/attribute in a class now goes to the definition in its\n  super class.\n- big **script api changes**:\n    - the line and column parameters of ``jedi.script`` are now deprecated\n    - ``completions`` deprecated, use ``complete`` instead\n    - ``goto_assignments`` deprecated, use ``goto`` instead\n    - ``goto_definitions`` deprecated, use ``infer`` instead\n    - ``call_signatures`` deprecated, use ``get_signatures`` instead\n    - ``usages`` deprecated, use ``get_references`` instead\n    - ``jedi.names`` deprecated, use ``jedi.script(...).get_names()``\n- ``basename.goto_assignments`` renamed to ``basename.goto``\n- add follow_imports to ``name.goto``. now its signature matches\n  ``script.goto``.\n- **python 2 support deprecated**. for this release it is best effort. python 2\n  has reached the end of its life and now it's just about a smooth transition.\n  bugs for python 2 will not be fixed anymore and a third of the tests are\n  already skipped.\n- removed ``settings.no_completion_duplicates``. it wasn't tested and nobody\n  was probably using it anyway.\n- removed ``settings.use_filesystem_cache`` and\n  ``settings.additional_dynamic_modules``, they have no usage anymore. pretty\n  much nobody was probably using them.\n\n0.15.2 (2019-12-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- signatures are now detected a lot better\n- add fuzzy completions with ``script(...).completions(fuzzy=true)``\n- files bigger than one mb (about 20kloc) get cropped to avoid getting\n  stuck completely.\n- many small bugfixes\n- a big refactoring around contexts/values\n\n0.15.1 (2019-08-13)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- small bugfix and removal of a print statement\n\n0.15.0 (2019-08-11)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- added file path completions, there's a **new** ``completion.type`` now:\n  ``path``. example: ``'/ho`` -> ``'/home/``\n- ``*args``/``**kwargs`` resolving. if possible jedi replaces the parameters\n  with the actual alternatives.\n- better support for enums/dataclasses\n- when using interpreter, properties are now executed, since a lot of people\n  have complained about this. discussion in #1299, #1347.\n\nnew apis:\n\n- ``name.get_signatures() -> list[signature]``. signatures are similar to\n  ``callsignature``. ``name.params`` is therefore deprecated.\n- ``signature.to_string()`` to format signatures.\n- ``signature.params -> list[paramname]``, paramname has the\n  following additional attributes ``infer_default()``, ``infer_annotation()``,\n  ``to_string()``, and ``kind``.\n- ``name.execute() -> list[name]``, makes it possible to infer\n  return values of functions.\n\n\n0.14.1 (2019-07-13)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- callsignature.index should now be working a lot better\n- a couple of smaller bugfixes\n\n0.14.0 (2019-06-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- added ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=true)`` as well as ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=true)``\n- stubs are used now for type inference\n- typeshed is used for better type inference\n- reworked name.full_name, should have more correct return values\n\n0.13.3 (2019-02-24)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- fixed an issue with embedded python, see https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/issues/870\n\n0.13.2 (2018-12-15)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- fixed a bug that led to jedi spawning a lot of subprocesses.\n\n0.13.1 (2018-10-02)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- bugfixes, because tensorflow completions were still slow.\n\n0.13.0 (2018-10-02)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- a small release. some bug fixes.\n- remove python 3.3 support. python 3.3 support has been dropped by the python\n  foundation.\n- default environments are now using the same python version as the python\n  process. in 0.12.x, we used to load the latest python version on the system.\n- added ``include_builtins`` as a parameter to usages.\n- ``goto_assignments`` has a new ``follow_builtin_imports`` parameter that\n  changes the previous behavior slightly.\n\n0.12.1 (2018-06-30)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- this release forces you to upgrade parso. if you don't, nothing will work\n  anymore. otherwise changes should be limited to bug fixes. unfortunately jedi\n  still uses a few internals of parso that make it hard to keep compatibility\n  over multiple releases. parso >=0.3.0 is going to be needed.\n\n0.12.0 (2018-04-15)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- virtualenv/environment support\n- f-string completion/goto support\n- cannot crash with segfaults anymore\n- cleaned up import logic\n- understand async/await and autocomplete it (including async generators)\n- better namespace completions\n- passing tests for windows (including ci for windows)\n- remove python 2.6 support\n\n0.11.1 (2017-12-14)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- parso update - the caching layer was broken\n- better usages - a lot of internal code was ripped out and improved.\n\n0.11.0 (2017-09-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- split jedi's parser into a separate project called ``parso``.\n- avoiding side effects in repl completion.\n- numpy docstring support should be much better.\n- moved the `settings.*recursion*` away, they are no longer usable.\n\n0.10.2 (2017-04-05)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- python packaging sucks. some files were not included in 0.10.1.\n\n0.10.1 (2017-04-05)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- fixed a few very annoying bugs.\n- prepared the parser to be factored out of jedi.\n\n0.10.0 (2017-02-03)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- actual semantic completions for the complete python syntax.\n- basic type inference for ``yield from`` pep 380.\n- pep 484 support (most of the important features of it). thanks claude! (@reinhrst)\n- added ``get_line_code`` to ``name`` and ``completion`` objects.\n- completely rewritten the type inference engine.\n- a new and better parser for (fast) parsing diffs of python code.\n\n0.9.0 (2015-04-10)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- the import logic has been rewritten to look more like python's. there is now\n  an ``inferstate.modules`` import cache, which resembles ``sys.modules``.\n- integrated the parser of 2to3. this will make refactoring possible. it will\n  also be possible to check for error messages (like compiling an ast would give)\n  in the future.\n- with the new parser, the type inference also completely changed. it's now\n  simpler and more readable.\n- completely rewritten repl completion.\n- added ``jedi.names``, a command to do static analysis. thanks to that\n  sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!\n- alpha version of the linter.\n\n\n0.8.1 (2014-07-23)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that improve\n  autocompletion for builtin libraries. fixed.\n\n0.8.0 (2014-05-05)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- memory consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) has been reduced\n  drastically. loading times are down as well (it takes basically as long as an\n  import).\n- repl completion is starting to become usable.\n- various small api changes. generally this release focuses on stability and\n  refactoring of internal apis.\n- introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating correct array\n  indices and ``__getattr__`` strings possible.\n\n0.7.0 (2013-08-09)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- switched from lgpl to mit license.\n- added an interpreter class to the api to make autocompletion in repl\n  possible.\n- added autocompletion support for namespace packages.\n- add sith.py, a new random testing method.\n\n0.6.0 (2013-05-14)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- much faster parser with builtin part caching.\n- a test suite, thanks @tkf.\n\n0.5 versions (2012)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- initial development.\n\n\n",
