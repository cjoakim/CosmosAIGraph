  "description": "# matplotlib inline back-end for ipython and jupyter\n\nthis package provides support for matplotlib to display figures directly inline in the jupyter notebook and related clients, as shown below.\n\n## installation\n\nwith conda:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge matplotlib-inline\n```\n\nwith pip:\n\n```bash\npip install matplotlib-inline\n```\n\n## usage\n\nnote that in current versions of jupyterlab and jupyter notebook, the explicit use of the `%matplotlib inline` directive is not needed anymore, though other third-party clients may still require it.\n\nthis will produce a figure immediately below:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 3*np.pi, 500)\nplt.plot(x, np.sin(x**2))\nplt.title('a simple chirp');\n```\n\n## license\n\nlicensed under the terms of the bsd 3-clause license, by the ipython development team (see `license` file).\n\nbsd 3-clause license\n\ncopyright (c) 2019-2022, ipython development team.\nall rights reserved.\n\nredistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1. redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n   list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n2. redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n   this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n   and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n3. neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its\n   contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n   this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nthis software is provided by the copyright holders and contributors \"as is\"\nand any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the\nimplied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are\ndisclaimed. in no event shall the copyright holder or contributors be liable\nfor any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential\ndamages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or\nservices; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however\ncaused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability,\nor tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use\nof this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.\n",
