 check out more examples in the [notebooks](https://github.com/ibm/differential-privacy-library/blob/main/notebooks/) directory, or [dive straight in](https://github.com/ibm/differential-privacy-library/blob/main/diffprivlib/).\n\n## contents\n\ndiffprivlib is comprised of four major components:\n1. __mechanisms:__ these are the building blocks of differential privacy, and are used in all models that implement differential privacy. mechanisms have little or no default settings, and are intended for use by experts implementing their own models. they can, however, be used outside models for separate investigations, etc.\n1. __models:__ this module includes machine learning models with differential privacy. diffprivlib currently has models for clustering, classification, regression, dimensionality reduction and pre-processing.\n1. __tools:__ diffprivlib comes with a number of generic tools for differentially private data analysis. this includes differentially private histograms, following the same format as [numpy's histogram function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram.html).\n1. __accountant:__ the `budgetaccountant` class can be used to track privacy budget and calculate total privacy loss using advanced composition techniques. \n\n\n## setup\n\n### installation with `pip`\n\nthe library is designed to run with python 3.\nthe library can be installed from the pypi repository using `pip` (or `pip3`):\n\n```bash\npip install diffprivlib\n```\n\n### manual installation\n\nfor the most recent version of the library, either download the source code or clone the repository in your directory of choice:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ibm/differential-privacy-library\n```\n\nto install `diffprivlib`, do the following in the project folder (alternatively, you can run `python3 -m pip install .`):\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\nthe library comes with a basic set of unit tests for `pytest`. to check your install, you can run all the unit tests by calling `pytest` in the install folder:\n\n```bash\npytest\n```\n\n## citing diffprivlib\nif you use diffprivlib for research, please consider citing the following reference paper:\n```\n@article{diffprivlib,\n  title={diffprivlib: the {ibm} differential privacy library},\n  author={holohan, naoise and braghin, stefano and mac aonghusa, p{\\'o}l and levacher, killian},\n  year={2019},\n  journal = {arxiv e-prints},\n  archiveprefix = \"arxiv\",\n  volume = {1907.02444 [cs.cr]},\n  primaryclass = \"cs.cr\",\n  month = jul\n}\n```\n\n## references\n\n* holohan, n., antonatos, s., braghin, s. and mac aonghusa, p., 2018. the bounded laplace mechanism in differential privacy. arxiv preprint arxiv:1808.10410.\n* holohan, n., braghin, s., mac aonghusa, p. and levacher, k., 2019. diffprivlib: the ibm differential privacy library. arxiv preprint arxiv:1907.02444.\n* ludwig, h., baracaldo, n., thomas, g., zhou, y., anwar, a., rajamoni, s., ong, y., radhakrishnan, j., verma, a., sinn, m. and purcell, m., 2020. ibm federated learning: an enterprise framework white paper v0. 1. arxiv preprint arxiv:2007.10987.\n* holohan, n. and braghin, s., 2021. secure random sampling in differential privacy. in computer security\u2013esorics 2021: 26th european symposium on research in computer security, darmstadt, germany, october 4\u20138, 2021, proceedings, part ii 26 (pp. 523-542). springer international publishing.\n",
