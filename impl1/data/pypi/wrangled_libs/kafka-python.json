it is really\n>>> # only useful if you configure internal batching using linger_ms\n>>> producer.flush()\n\n>>> # use a key for hashed-partitioning\n>>> producer.send('foobar', key=b'foo', value=b'bar')\n\n>>> # serialize json messages\n>>> import json\n>>> producer = kafkaproducer(value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))\n>>> producer.send('fizzbuzz', {'foo': 'bar'})\n\n>>> # serialize string keys\n>>> producer = kafkaproducer(key_serializer=str.encode)\n>>> producer.send('flipflap', key='ping', value=b'1234')\n\n>>> # compress messages\n>>> producer = kafkaproducer(compression_type='gzip')\n>>> for i in range(1000):\n...     producer.send('foobar', b'msg %d' % i)\n\n>>> # include record headers. the format is list of tuples with string key\n>>> # and bytes value.\n>>> producer.send('foobar', value=b'c29tzsb2ywx1zq==', headers=[('content-encoding', b'base64')])\n\n>>> # get producer performance metrics\n>>> metrics = producer.metrics()\n\nthread safety\n*************\n\nthe kafkaproducer can be used across threads without issue, unlike the\nkafkaconsumer which cannot.\n\nwhile it is possible to use the kafkaconsumer in a thread-local manner,\nmultiprocessing is recommended.\n\ncompression\n***********\n\nkafka-python supports gzip compression/decompression natively. to produce or consume lz4\ncompressed messages, you should install python-lz4 (pip install lz4).\nto enable snappy compression/decompression install python-snappy (also requires snappy library).\nsee <https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/install.html#optional-snappy-install>\nfor more information.\n\noptimized crc32 validation\n**************************\n\nkafka uses crc32 checksums to validate messages. kafka-python includes a pure\npython implementation for compatibility. to improve performance for high-throughput\napplications, kafka-python will use `crc32c` for optimized native code if installed.\nsee https://pypi.org/project/crc32c/\n\nprotocol\n********\n\na secondary goal of kafka-python is to provide an easy-to-use protocol layer\nfor interacting with kafka brokers via the python repl. this is useful for\ntesting, probing, and general experimentation. the protocol support is\nleveraged to enable a kafkaclient.check_version() method that\nprobes a kafka broker and attempts to identify which version it is running\n(0.8.0 to 2.4+).\n\n\n",
