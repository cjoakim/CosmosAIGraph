  "description": "# pyzmq: python bindings for \u00f8mq\n\nthis package contains python bindings for [zeromq](https://zeromq.org).\n\u00f8mq is a lightweight and fast messaging implementation.\n\npyzmq should work with any reasonable version of python (\u2265 3.4),\nas well as python 2.7 and 3.3, as well as pypy.\nthe cython backend used by cpython supports libzmq \u2265 2.1.4 (including 3.2.x and 4.x),\nbut the cffi backend used by pypy only supports libzmq \u2265 3.2.2 (including 4.x).\n\nfor a summary of changes to pyzmq, see our\n[changelog](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).\n\n### \u00f8mq 3.x, 4.x\n\npyzmq fully supports the 3.x and 4.x apis of libzmq,\ndeveloped at [zeromq/libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq).\nno code to change, no flags to pass,\njust build pyzmq against the latest and it should work.\n\npyzmq does not support the old libzmq 2 api on pypy.\n\n## documentation\n\nsee pyzmq's sphinx-generated\ndocumentation [on read the docs](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io) for api\ndetails, and some notes on python and cython development. if you want to\nlearn about using \u00f8mq in general, the excellent [\u00f8mq\nguide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/py:all) is the place to start, which has a\npython version of every example. we also have some information on our\n[wiki](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/wiki).\n\n## downloading\n\nunless you specifically want to develop pyzmq, we recommend downloading\nthe pyzmq source code or wheels from\n[pypi](https://pypi.io/project/pyzmq/),\nor install with conda.\n\nyou can also get the latest source code from our github repository, but\nbuilding from the repository will require that you install recent cython.\n\n## building and installation\n\nfor more detail on building pyzmq, see [our wiki](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/wiki/building-and-installing-pyzmq).\n\nwe build wheels for macos, windows, and linux, so you can get a binary on those platforms with:\n\n```\npip install pyzmq\n```\n\nbut compiling from source with `pip install pyzmq` should work in most environments.\nespecially on macos, make sure you are using the latest pip (\u2265 8), or it may not find the right wheels.\n\nif the wheel doesn't work for some reason, or you want to force pyzmq to be compiled\n(this is often preferable if you already have libzmq installed and configured the way you want it),\nyou can force installation with:\n\n```\npip install --no-binary=:all: pyzmq\n```\n\nwhen compiling pyzmq (e.g. installing with pip on linux),\nit is generally recommended that zeromq be installed separately,\nvia homebrew, apt, yum, etc:\n\n```\n# debian-based\nsudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev\n\n# rhel-based\nsudo yum install libzmq3-devel\n```\n\nif this is not available, pyzmq will _try_ to build libzmq as a python extension,\nthough this is not guaranteed to work.\n\nbuilding pyzmq from the git repo (including release tags on github) requires cython.\n\n## old versions\n\npyzmq 16 drops support python 2.6 and 3.2.\nif you need to use one of those python versions, you can pin your pyzmq version to before 16:\n\n```\npip install 'pyzmq<16'\n```\n\nfor libzmq 2.0.x, use 'pyzmq\\<2.1'\n\npyzmq-2.1.11 was the last version of pyzmq to support python 2.5,\nand pyzmq \u2265 2.2.0 requires python \u2265 2.6.\npyzmq-13.0.0 introduces pypy support via cffi, which only supports libzmq-3.2.2 and newer.\n\npyzmq releases \u2264 2.2.0 matched libzmq versioning, but this is no longer the case,\nstarting with pyzmq 13.0.0 (it was the thirteenth release, so why not?).\npyzmq \u2265 13.0 follows semantic versioning conventions accounting only for pyzmq itself.\n",
