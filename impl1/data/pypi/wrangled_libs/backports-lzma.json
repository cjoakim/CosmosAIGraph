http://docs.python.org/dev/library/lzma.html\n* xz utils - http://tukaani.org/xz/\n\nthis code is a backport of the python 3.3 standard library module ``lzma`` for\nuse on older versions of python where it was not included. it is available\nfrom pypi (released downloads only) and github (repository):\n\n* pypi - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.lzma/\n* github - https://github.com/peterjc/backports.lzma\n\nthere are some older python libraries like pyliblzma and pylzma but these are\nboth using lzma utils (not xz utils, so they have no xz support).\n\n* pyliblzma - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyliblzma\n* pylzma - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylzma/\n* lzma utils - http://tukaani.org/lzma/\n\n\nsupported platforms\n===================\n\nthe ``lmza`` module provided with python 3.3 should work on all the main\noperating systems, so in theory so too should this backport:\n\n* mac os x: tested under python 2.6, 2.7, 3.0 to 3.4 inclusive\n* linux: tested under python 2.6, 2.7, 3.0 to 3.6 inclusive\n* windows: tested under python 2.7, 3.6 covering 32-bit and 64-bit,\n  and msvc and mingw32 compilers\n\nother than some minor changes in the exceptions for some errors, based on the\nunit tests everything seems to be working fine.\n\nsupport under python 2.6 and 2.7 appears to be working in that all the\nappropriate unit tests now pass. supporting older verions of python 2 is\nprobably going to be too much work.\n\nwe now also support the pypy implementation of python 2.7, currently tested\nwith pypy 5.8.0. it does not currently work on the  pypy implementation of\npython 3, but that comes with the ``lzma`` standard library module anyway.\n\n\ninstallation\n============\n\ni recommend the conda packaging system which supports linux, macos and\nwindows. thanks to the ``conda-forge`` package you should be able to install\nthis library with one line, and have the dependencies handled automatically::\n\n    $ conda install -c conda-forge backports.lzma\n\nif you are on linux, there is a good chance that the system packages will\ninclude this library and handle the dependencies, e.g. on redhat/centos try::\n\n    $ sudo yum install python-backports-lzma\n\notherwise, first you must install the xz utils c library. on redhat or\ncentos linux sytems, try::\n\n    $ sudo yum install xz-devel\n\non a debian based linux distribution use::\n\n    $ sudo apt-get install liblzma-dev\n\notherwise do this from source, this is what i do on mac os x::\n\n    $ curl -l -o http://tukaani.org/xz/xz-5.0.4.tar.gz\n    $ tar -zxvf xz-5.0.4.tar.gz\n    $ cd xz-5.0.4\n    $ ./configure --prefix=$home\n    $ make\n    $ make check\n    $ make install\n\nnow you can install this ``lzma`` backport. if using ``pip``, this should\nwork::\n\n    $ pip install backports.lzma\n\notherwise, you can compile this the old fashioned way. first download and\ndecompress the source code, or clone the github repository::\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/peterjc/backports.lzma.git\n    $ cd backports.lzma\n    $ python setup.py install\n    $ cd test\n    $ python test_lzma.py\n\nto install for a specific version of python, replace ``python`` (which will\nuse the system's default python) in the above with a specific version like\n``python2``, ``python2.6`` or ``python3``, ``python3.2``, etc.\n\nthis should find the xz util header file and library automatically (and will\ncheck for a local install under your home directory). you should now be able\nto import the backport from python as shown below.\n\nif you are trying to install this under the system python, you will need\nadmin rights and replace ``python setup.py install`` with\n``sudo python setup.py install`` instead.\n\n\nusage\n=====\n\nthe expected usage is as follows if you want to prioritise the standard\nlibrary provided lzma if present::\n\n    try:\n        import lzma\n    except importerror:\n        from backports import lzma\n    #then use lzma as normal, for example:\n    assert b\"hello!\" == lzma.decompress(lzma.compress(b\"hello!\"))\n\nplease refer to the ``lzma`` documentation online:\nhttp://docs.python.org/dev/library/lzma.html\n\nnote that while ``lzma`` should be available on python 3.3 onwards, you can\nstill install the backport. this is useful for two reasons, first testing the\ntwo act the same way, and second it is possible that your python installation\nlacks the standard library ``lzma``. this can happen if python was installed\nfrom source and xz utils was not available. if this was a systems level python\ninstall, as a user you could still install xz utils and this backport under\nyour own account.\n\nthis is using the shared ``backports`` namespace introduced by brandon rhodes\nas documented here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports/ and\nhttp://bitbucket.org/brandon/backports\n\n\nrevisions\n=========\n\n* v0.0.1 - january 2013\n   * first public release\n* v0.0.2 - april 2013\n   * fix the seekable attribute on python 2 (tomer chachamu)\n   * more search paths for lib/include headers (wynn wilkes)\n* v0.0.3 - june 2014\n   * supports unicode filenames on python 2 (irving reid)\n* v0.0.4 - september 2014\n   * declare namespace package to avoid warnings (ralph bean)\n     (later retracted from pypi due to installation problems with\n     ``setuptools`` versus ``distutils``, see github issue #8 and #9).\n* v0.0.5 - june 2016\n   * backported fix for python issue 19839 to ignore non-lzma trailing data\n     (original python 3.5.1 patch by nadeem vawda, backported by deroko, see\n     github pull request #5).\n* v0.0.6 - june 2016\n   * updated namespace packaging declaration now required by more recent\n     versions of setuptools which prevented simple installation of v0.0.4\n     and v0.0.5 from pypi.\n* v0.0.7 - february 2017\n   * check and prefer the ``sys.prefix`` at installation time to find the\n     ``lib`` and ``include`` headers (john kirkham).\n* v0.0.8 - february 2017\n   * switch to using ``readme.rst`` for this document in order to display\n     nicely on pypi.\n* v0.0.9 - 3 january 2018\n   * now compiles under windows with passing tests, checked under appveyor\n     (see github pull request #25 by nehal j wani).\n* v0.0.10 - 8 january 2018\n   * now supports pypy (specifically their python 2 implementation, but not\n     yet pypy3 which implements python 3; see github pull requests #27 and\n     #29 by micha\u0142 g\u00f3rny).\n* v0.0.11 - 16 may 2018\n   * should address namespace issues in v0.0.4, v0.0.5 and v0.0.6 related to\n     a problem in setuptools, and causing side effects with other backports\n     (see pull request #32 from toshio kuratomi, and issues #8, #16 and #28).\n* v0.0.12 - 30 june 2018\n   * fixes locale issue in ``setup.py`` under python 3 (see #33 reported by\n     ben hearsum).\n* v0.0.13 - 11 july 2018\n   * use ``setuptools`` instead of ``distutils`` if available, useful for\n     compiling your own wheel or egg files (see #34 from @wiggin15).\n* v0.0.14 - 12 september 2019\n   * back ported fix decompressing files using ``format_alone`` without\n     end markers (see #40 from ma kin and python issue 21872).\n\n\ncontributors\n============\n\nthe initial python lzma module implementation was by per \u00f8yvind karlsen, which\nwas then rewritten by nadeem vawda and included with python 3.3. based on this\nwork, it was backported to also run on python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 by\npeter cock.\n\nlater contributors include: tomer chachamu, wynn wilkes, irving reid,\nralph bean, deroko, john kirkham, nehal j wani, micha\u0142 g\u00f3rny, toshio kuratomi,\nma lin.\n\n\nbug reports\n===========\n\nplease report any reproducible bugs via the github issue tracker at\nhttps://github.com/peterjc/backports.lzma/issues including details about\nyour operating system, version of python, xy utils, the lzma backport etc.\nreproducible test cases are particularly helpful.\n\nif you can demonstrate a problem in this backport but not in the ``lzma``\nmodule included with python 3.3 or later, then it is clearly something we\nwill need to fix.\n\nany issues in the ``lzma`` module as bundled with python 3.3 or later\nshould be reported to the python project at http://bugs.python.org instead\n(and we can hopefully apply any official fix to the backport as well).\n\n\nrelease process\n===============\n\nthe version is incremented in file ``backports/lzma/__init__.py`` (from where\n``setup.py`` will extract it at runtime).\n\nafter testing locally and with travisci (see below), new releases are tagged\nin git as follows::\n\n    $ git tag backports.lzma.vx.x.x\n\ntags must explicitly be pushed to github::\n\n    $ git push origin master --tags\n\ni then use the following to upload a new release to the python packaging index\n(pypi)::\n\n    $ python setup.py sdist\n    $ twine upload dist/backports.lzma-x.x.x.tar.gz\n\nif not already installed, try ``pip install twine``.\n\nthe update then appears on http://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.lzma/\n\n\nautomated testing\n=================\n\ntravisci is being used for continuous integration testing under linux, see\nhttps://travis-ci.org/peterjc/backports.lzma\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/peterjc/backports.lzma/master.svg\n   :alt: linux testing with travisci\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/peterjc/backports.lzma/branches\n\nsimilarly, appveyor is being used for testing under windows, see:\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/peterjc/backports-lzma/history\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/peterjc/backports-lzma/master.svg\n   :alt: windows testing with appveyor\n   :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/peterjc/backports-lzma/history",
