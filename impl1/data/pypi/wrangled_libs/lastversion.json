lastversion in terminal](https://www.getpagespeed.com/img/lastversion.gif)\n\nenglish | [\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587](readme-zh-cn.md)\n\na tiny command-line utility that helps to answer a simple question:\n\n> what is the latest *stable* version for a project?\n\n... and, optionally, download/install it.\n\n`lastversion` allows finding well-formatted, the latest release version of a project from these \n supported locations:\n\n*   [github](https://github.com/dvershinin/lastversion/wiki/github-specifics)\n*   gitlab\n*   bitbucket\n*   pypi\n*   mercurial\n*   sourceforge\n*   wikipedia\n*   wordpress plugin directory\n*   arbitrary software sites which publish releases in rss/atom feeds\n\n## why you need `lastversion`\n\nin general, quite many project authors complicate finding the latest version by:\n\n*   creating a formal release that is clearly a release candidate (`rc` in tag), but forgetting to\n    mark it as a pre-release\n\n*   putting extraneous text in release tag e.g. `release-1.2.3` or `name-1.2.3-2019` anything fancy \n    like that\n\n*   putting or not putting the `v` prefix inside release tags. today yes, tomorrow not. i'm not\n    consistent about it myself :)\n\n*   switching from one version format to another, e.g. `v20150121` to `v2.0.1`\n\nthere is no consistency in human beings.\n\nto deal with all this mess and simply get a well-formatted, last *stable* version (or download\n url!) on the command line, you can use `lastversion`.\n\nits primary use is for build systems - whenever you want to watch specific projects for released\nversions to build packages automatically.\nor otherwise require getting the latest version in your automation scripts.\n\n[like i do](https://www.getpagespeed.com/redhat)\n\n`lastversion` does a little bit of ai to detect if releasers mistakenly filed a beta version as a \nstable release.\nit incorporates logic for cleaning up human inconsistency from \nversion information.\n\n## synopsis\n\n```bash\nlastversion apache/incubator-pagespeed-ngx \n#> 1.13.35.2\n\nlastversion download apache/incubator-pagespeed-ngx \n#> downloaded incubator-pagespeed-ngx-v1.13.35.2-stable.tar.gz\n\nlastversion download apache/incubator-pagespeed-ngx -o pagespeed.tar.gz \n#> downloads with chosen filename\n\nlastversion https://transmissionbt.com/\n#> 3.0\n\nlastversion format \"mysqld  ver 5.6.51-91.0 for linux\"\n#> 5.6.51\n```\n\n## installation for rpm-based systems\n\nsupported:\n\n* centos/rhel 7, 8, 9 including clones like almalinux and rocky linux\n* amazon linux 2\n* fedora linux\n\n```bash\nsudo yum -y install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-latest.rpm\nsudo yum -y install lastversion\n```\n   \n## installation for other systems\n\ninstalling with `pip` is easiest:\n\n```bash\npip install lastversion\n```\n    \n## usage\n\ntypically, you would just pass a repository url (or repo owner/name to it) as the only argument, \ne.g.:\n\n```bash\nlastversion https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools\n```\n\nequivalently accepted invocation with the same output is:\n\n```bash\nlastversion gperftools/gperftools\n```    \n\nif you're lazy to even copy-paste a project's url, you can just type its name as argument, which \nwill use repository search api (slower).\nhelps to answer what is the latest linux version:\n\n```bash\nlastversion linux\n```\n\nor wondering what is the latest version of wordpress? \n\n```bash\nlastversion wordpress\n```\n   \na special value of `self` for the main argument, will look up the last release of `lastversion` \nitself.\n\nfor more options to control output or behavior, see `--help` output:    \n\n```text\nusage:

text. useful\n                        for repos with multiple projects inside\n  --exclude regex       only consider releases not containing this text.\n                        useful for repos with multiple projects inside\n  --even                only even versions like 1.[2].x, or 3.[6].x are\n                        considered as stable                        \n  --filter regex        filters --assets result by a regular expression\n  --having-asset [asset]\n                        only consider releases with this asset\n  -su, --shorter-urls   a tiny bit shorter urls produced\n  --at

the project. the default is via internal\n                        lookup or github search\n  -y, --assumeyes       automatically answer yes for all questions\n  --version             show program's version number and exit\n```\n\nthe `--format` will affect what kind of information from the last release and in which format will\n be displayed, e.g.:\n\n*   `version` is the default. simply outputs well-formatted version number of the latest release\n\n*   `assets` will output a newline-separated list of assets urls (if any), otherwise link to\n    sources archive\n\n*   `source` will output link to source archive, no matter if the release has some assets added\n\n*   `json` can be used by external python modules or for debugging, it is dict/json output of an api\n    call that satisfied last version checks\n\n*   `tag` will emit just the latest release's tag name, which useful if you're constructing download\n    url yourself or need the tag name otherwise\n\nan asset is a downloadable file that typically represents an executable, or otherwise \n\"ready to launch\" project. it's what you see filed under formal releases, and is usually a compiled \n(for specific platform), program.\n\nsource files, are either tarballs or zipballs of sources for the source code of release. \n\nyou can display either assets or source urls of the latest release, by passing the corresponding\n `--format flag`, e.g. `--format source`\n\nyou also simply pass `--source` instead of `--format source`, and `--assets` instead of \n`--format assets`, as in:\n\n```bash\nlastversion --assets mautic/mautic \n#> https://github.com/mautic/mautic/archive/2.15.1/mautic-2.15.1.tar.gz\n```\n\nby default, `lastversion` filters output of `--assets` to be os-specific. who needs `.exe` on linux?\n\nto override this behavior, you can use `--filter`, which has a regular expression as its argument.\nto disable os filtering, use `--filter .`, this will match everything.\n\nyou can naturally use `--filter` in place where you would use `grep`, e.g. \n`lastversion --assets --filter win repo`\n\n### use case: work with a multi-project repository\n\nsometimes a single repository actually hosts many components, and creates releases that\nhave separate version line for each component. \n\nto help `lastversion` get a component's version for such repos, use `--only` and `--exclude` \nswitches.\nthey make `lastversion` look at only those releases which are tagged (or not) with specified \nstrings.\n\n[example](https://github.com/lastversion-test-repos/autoscaler/tags):\n\n```bash\nlastversion --only chart https://github.com/lastversion-test-repos/autoscaler\n```\n\nthe above will report `9.16.0`.\n\n```bash\nlastversion --exclude chart https://github.com/lastversion-test-repos/autoscaler\n```\n\nthe above will report a non-chart latest version, `1.23.0`.\n\nuseful for hard cases, you can pass in regular expressions for both arguments, by prepending them \nwith tilde, like so:\n\n```bash\nlastversion --only '~-po.-' https://github.com/lastversion-test-repos/autoscaler\n```\n\nthe above will consider only releases tagged with -po*d*-, or -po*v*-, etc.\n\n### use case: how to download the latest version of something\n\nyou can also use `lastversion` to download assets/sources for the latest release.\n\ndownload the most recent mautic source release:\n\n```bash\nlastversion download mautic/mautic \n```\n    \ncustomize downloaded filename (works only for sources, which is the default):\n\n```bash\nlastversion download mautic/mautic -o mautic.tar.gz\n```\n\nyou can also directly fetch and extract the latest release's file into the current working directory \nby using `extract` command:\n\n```bash\nlastversion extract wordpress\n```\n    \nyou can have `lastversion` output sources/assets urls and have those downloaded by \nsomething else:    \n\n```bash\nwget $(lastversion --assets mautic/mautic)\n```\n\nthis will download all assets of the newest stable mautic, which are 2 zip files.\n\nhow this works: `lastversion` outputs all asset urls, each on a new line, and `wget` is smart \nenough to download each url. magic :)\n\nfor releases that have no assets added, it will download the source archive.  \n\nto always download source, use `--source` instead:\n\n```bash\nwget $(lastversion --source mautic/mautic)  \n```\n\n### use case: download specific asset under specified filename\n\nif you want to download specific asset of the last version's release and save the downloaded file\n under a desired name, combine `-d` option (for download name) and `--filter` for specifying assets \n filter.\n\nexample:\n\n```bash\nlastversion --pre aircoookie/wled --format assets --filter esp32.bin -d esp32.bin\n```\n\n### use case: get the last version (betas are fine)\n\nwe consider the latest release is the one that is stable / not marked as beta.\nif you think otherwise, then pass `--pre` switch and if the latest version of repository is a \npre-release, then you'll get its version instead:\n\n```bash\nlastversion --pre mautic/mautic \n#> 2.15.2b0\n```\n    \n### use case: version of a specific branch\n\nfor some projects, there may be several stable releases available simultaneously, in different\nbranches. an obvious example is php. you can use `--major` flag to specify the major release\nversion to match with, to help you find the latest stable release of a branch, like so:\n\n```bash\nlastversion php/php-src --major 7.2\n``` \n\nthis will give you current stable version of php 7.2.x, e.g. `7.2.28`.\n\nbranch selector is easy to be specified after semicolon, and together with the search api,\na clean invocation for the same would be:\n\n```bash\nlastversion php:7.2\n```\n\nthe branch selector can also be used to get specific release details, e.g.:\n\n```bash\nlastversion php:7.2.33 --assets\n```\n\n### use case: releases with specific assets\n\nsometimes a project makes nice formal releases but delay in uploading assets for releases.\nand you might be interested in specific asset type always.\nthen you can make `lastversion` consider as latest only the last release with specific asset name.\neasy with the `--having-asset` switch:\n\n```bash\nlastversion telegramdesktop/tdesktop --having-asset \"linux 64 bit: binary\"\n```\n\nthe argument value to `--having-asset` can be made as regular expression. for this, prepend it \nwith tilde sign. e.g. to get releases with macos installers:\n\n```bash\nlastversion telegramdesktop/tdesktop --having-asset \"~\\.dmg$\"\n```\n\nyou can pass no value to `--having-asset` at all. then `lastversion` will only return the latest \nrelease which has **any** assets added to it:\n\n```bash\nlastversion telegramdesktop/tdesktop --having-asset\n```\n\n### use case: version of an operating system\n\nthe operating systems are usually *not* versioned through github releases or such.\nit is a challenge to get the last stable version of an os other than from its website,\nor other announcement channels.\n\nan easy compromise that `lastversion` does about this, is hard coding well-known os names, and using\nwikipedia behind the scenes:\n\n```bash \nlastversion rocky #> 8.4\nlastversion windows #> 10.0.19043.1081\nlastversion ios #> 14.6\n```\n\nyou can supply a fully-qualified url to a wikipedia page for an os/software project to get version\nfrom there, e.g.:\n\n```bash\nlastversion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rocky_linux #> 8.4\n```\n\n### special use case: nginx stable vs mainline branch version\n\n```bash\nlastversion https://nginx.org --major stable #> 1.16.1\nlastversion https://nginx.org --major mainline #> 1.17.9\n```\n    \nbehind the scenes, this checks with `hg.nginx.org` which is a mercurial web repo.\nthose are supported as well, e.g.\n\n```bash\nlastversion https://hg.example.com/project/\n```\n    \nmercurial repositories are rather rare these days, but support has been added primarily for nginx.\n\n### special use case: find the release of a pypi project\n\nmost python libraries/apps are hosted on pypi. to check versions of a project on pypi, you can use:\n\n```bash\nlastversion https://pypi.org/project/requests/\n```\n\nif you prefer using a shorter repo name, ensure `--at pip` switch, like so:\n\n```bash\nlastversion requests --at pip\n```\n\n### install an rpm asset\n\nif a project provides `.rpm` assets and your system has `yum` or `dnf`, you can install the project's\n rpm directly, like so:\n\n```bash\nsudo lastversion install mailspring\n```\n \nthis finds [mailspring](https://github.com/foundry376/mailspring), gets its latest release info, \nfilters assets for `.rpm` and passes it to `yum` / `dnf`. \n\nyou can even set up an auto-updater cron job which will ensure you are on the latest version of a\n package, like so:\n \n```bash\n@daily /usr/bin/lastversion install mailspring -y 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nif the mailspring github repo posts a release with newer `.rpm`, then it will be automatically\n installed, making sure you are running the latest and greatest mailspring version.\n  \nyou'll even get an email alert after update (standard cron feature).\n\nneedless to say, more often than not such rpm packages have no idea about all potentially missing\ndependencies. thus, only use `lastversion install ...` if the software is missing from the base\n`yum` repositories.\n\n### install an appimage\n\nif a project provides `.appimage`, you can install those directly using `lastversion`.\nthe `appimage` is self-contained linux executable file. what `lastversion` does for you, is fetch\nthe latest release's `appimage`, installs it under `~/applications/<app>` and makes it executable.\njust run:\n\n```bash\nlastversion install fluent-reader\n```\n\n### test version parser\n\nthe `test` command can be used for troubleshooting or simply well formatting a string with version:\n\n```bash\nlastversion test 'blah-1.2.3-devel' # > 1.2.3.dev0\nlastversion test '1.2.x' # > false (no clear version)\nlastversion test '1.2.3-rc1' # > 1.2.3rc1\n```\n\n### scripting with `lastversion` in `bash`\n\n#### semantic versioning support\n\nsometimes you only want to check updates for a specific semantic versioning level.\ndoes a project have a new minor release? does a project have a new major release?\nto print just the necessary semantic versioning base, use `--sem` option.\n\nacceptable values are `major`, `minor`, and `patch`.\n\n```bash\nlastversion wordpress --sem major\n#> 5\n```\n\n```bash\nlastversion wordpress --sem minor\n#> 5.9\n```\n\n```bash\nlastversion wordpress --sem patch\n#> 5.9.3\n```\n\nthe value `--sem patch` can be used to *normalize* a given result to semantic versioning,\nif a project doesn't follow the semantics strictly. e.g. sometimes wordpress would publish an x.y\nrelease while it's implicitly x.y.0. so let's say wordpress released \"5.10\":\n\n```bash\nlastversion wordpress --sem patch\n#> 5.10.0\n```\n\n#### format any version string\n\nsay you ran `mysqld --version` and got this output:\n\n> mysqld  ver 5.6.51-91.0 for linux on x86_64 (percona server (gpl), release 91.0, revision b59139e)\n\nthis is rather hard to parse in bash if you want to just extract the major mysql server version.\n\n`lastversion` can easily parse out and give the desired information based on desired semantic \nversioning level:\n\n```bash\nlastversion --sem major format \"mysqld  ver 5.6.51-91.0 for linux on x86_64 (percona server (gpl) , release 91.0, revision b59139e)\" \n#> 5\n```\n\n#### compare arbitrary versions\n\nuse `lastversion` for easy comparison of versions on the command line.\ncompare two versions, the command will output the highest version:\n\n```bash\nlastversion 1.2.3 -gt 1.2.4\n#> 1.2.4\n```\n\nsee the exit codes below, to find whether the first argument is a higher version, or the second.\n\nthe `--sem` option described earlier will affect both what's being printed and what semantic\nversioning base level is being compared, thus the result.\n\n#### check for new release\n\nwhen you're building some upstream package, and you did this before, there is a known \"last build\" \nversion.\nautomatic builds become easy with:\n\n```bash\ncurrently_built_ver=1.2.3 # stored somewhere, e.g. spec file in my case\nlastver=$(lastversion repo/owner -gt ${currently_built_ver})\nif [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then\n  # lastver is newer, update and trigger build\n  # ....\nfi\n```\n\nhere, the `-gt` is actually a switch passed to `lastversion`, which acts in a similar fashion to\n `-gt` comparison in bash.\n\nthere is more to it, if you want to make this reliable.\nsee my ranting on \n[rpm auto-builds with `lastversion`](https://github.com/dvershinin/lastversion/wiki/use-in-rpm-building)\n\n#### check if there is a newer kernel for your linux machine\n\n```bash\nlatest_kernel=$(lastversion linux -gt $(uname -r | cut -d '-' -f 1))\nif [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then\n  echo \"i better update my kernel now, because ${latest_kernel} is there\"\nelse \n  echo \"my kernel is latest and greatest.\"\nfi \n```  \n\n#### exit status codes\n\nexit status codes are the usual means of communicating a command's execution success or failure. \nso `lastversion` follows this: successful command returns `0` while anything else is an error of \nsome kind.\nfor example, when the latest stable release version if found, `0` is returned.\n`0` is also returned for `-gt` comparison when leftmost argument is newer than rightmost argument.\n \nexit status code `1` is returned for cases like no release tag existing for repository at all, or \nrepository does not exist.\n\nexit status code `2` is returned for `-gt` version comparison negative lookup, that is when rightmost argument is newer\nthan leftmost argument.\n\nexit status code `3` is returned when filtering assets of last release yields empty url set \n(no match)\n\n## tips\n\ngetting the latest version is heavy on the api, because github does not allow to fetch tags in \nchronological order, and some repositories switch from one version format to another, so *we can't \njust consider the highest version to be latest*.\nwe have to fetch every tag's commit date, and see if it's actually more recent. thus, it's slower\nwith larger repositories, which have potentially a lot of tags.\n\nthus, `lastversion` makes use of caching api response to be fast and light on github api,\nit does conditional etag validation, which, as per github api will not count towards rate limit.\nthe cache is stored in `~/.cache/lastversion` on linux systems.\n\nit is *much recommended* to set up your [github api token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\nbare api token is enough, you may deselect all permissions. \nyou can then increase your rate limit by adding the following `~/.bashrc` file:\n\n```bash\nexport github_api_token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n```\n\nyou can use either `github_api_token` or `github_token` environment variable.\nthe former has priority.\n    \nfor gitlab, you can use a\n[personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html):\n\n```bash\nexport gitlab_pa_token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n```\n\nthen run `source ~/.bashrc`. after this, `lastversion` will use it to get larger api calls allowance\nfrom github.\n\n## usage in a python module\n\nyou can use `lastversion.has_update(...)` to find whether an update for existing version of\n something is available, simply:\n\n```python\nfrom lastversion import has_update\nlatest_version = has_update(repo=\"mautic/mautic\", current_version='1.2.3')\nif latest_version:\n    print(f'newer mautic version is available: {latest_version}')\nelse:\n    print('no update is available')\n```\n\nthe `lastversion.has_update(...)` function accepts any url from a repository (or its short name\n, e.g. `owner/name`) and you should pass an existing/current version.\n\nif you are checking version of a project on pypi, supply an additional `at='pip'` argument,\nin order to avoid passing the full pypi uri of a project, and remove ambiguity with github hosted\n projects. for example, checking for newer requests\nlibrary:\n\n```python\nfrom lastversion import has_update\nlatest_version = has_update(repo=\"requests\", at='pip', current_version='1.2.3')\nif latest_version:\n    print('newer requests library is available: {latest_version}')\nelse:\n    print('no update is available')\n```\n\nthe `has_update` function returns either:\n\n*   the [version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.version) object\n*   `false` if there is no newer version than the one given\n\nalternatively, invoke `lastversion.latest(...)` function to get the latest version information\n for a repo.  \n \n```python\nfrom lastversion import latest\nfrom packaging import version\n\nlatest_mautic_version = latest(\"mautic/mautic\", output_format='version', pre_ok=true)\n\nprint(f'latest mautic version: {latest_mautic_version}')\n\nif latest_mautic_version >= version.parse('1.8.1'):\n    print('it is newer')\n```\n\nwith `output_format='version'` (the default), the function returns a \n[version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.version) object, or\n `none`. so you can do things like above, namely version comparison, checking dev status, etc.\n \nwith `output_format='dict'`, a dictionary returned with the latest release information, or `false`.\nthe dictionary keys vary between different project locations (github vs bitbucket, for example),\nbut are guaranteed to always have these keys:\n\n*   `version`: [version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.version) \n object, contains the found release version, e.g. `1.2.3`\n*   `source`: string, the identifier of the project source, e.g. `github`, or `gitlab`\n*   `tag_date`: datetime object, the release date, e.g. `2020-12-15 14:41:39`\n*   `from`: string, contains fully qualified url of the project\n*   `tag_name`: string, version control tag name corresponding to the release\n\nthe `lastversion.latest` function accepts 3 arguments\n\n*   `repo`, in format of `<owner>/<name>`, or any url under this repository, e.g. `https://github.com/dvershinin/lastversion/issues`   \n*   `format`, which accepts the same values as when you run `lastversion` interactively, as well as\n `dict` to return a dictionary as described above\n*   `pre_ok`, boolean for whether to include pre-releases as potential versions\n*   `at`, specifies project location when using one-word repo names, one of \n `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`, `pip`, `hg`, `sf`, `website-feed`, `local`\n\n## using in continuous integration\n\nyou can also use `lastversion` directly in your github action workflows, \nwith [`lastversion-action`](https://github.com/dvershinin/lastversion-action).\n\n## sponsored message\n\n**getpagespeed rpm repository**: enhance your
