  "description": "# jupyter client\n\n[![build status](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/actions)\n[![documentation status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jupyter-client/badge/?version=latest)](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n`jupyter_client` contains the reference implementation of the [jupyter protocol].\nit also provides client and kernel management apis for working with kernels.\n\nit also provides the `jupyter kernelspec` entrypoint\nfor installing kernelspecs for use with jupyter frontends.\n\n## development setup\n\nthe [jupyter contributor guides](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/content-contributor.html) provide extensive information on contributing code or documentation to jupyter projects. the limited instructions below for setting up a development environment are for your convenience.\n\n## coding\n\nyou'll need python and `pip` on the search path. clone the jupyter client git repository to your computer, for example in `/my/project/jupyter_client`\n\n```bash\ncd /my/projects/\ngit clone git@github.com:jupyter/jupyter_client.git\n```\n\nnow create an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs)\nand download the dependencies of code and test suite by executing:\n\n```bash\ncd /my/projects/jupyter_client/\npip install -e \".[test]\"\npytest\n```\n\nthe last command runs the test suite to verify the setup. during development, you can pass filenames to `pytest`, and it will execute only those tests.\n\n## documentation\n\nthe documentation of jupyter client is generated from the files in `docs/` using sphinx. instructions for setting up sphinx with a selection of optional modules are in the [documentation guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/docs-contributions/index.html). you'll also need the `make` command.\nfor a minimal sphinx installation to process the jupyter client docs, execute:\n\n```bash\npip install \".[doc]\"\n```\n\nthe following commands build the documentation in html format and check for broken links:\n\n```bash\ncd /my/projects/jupyter_client/docs/\nmake html linkcheck\n```\n\npoint your browser to the following url to access the generated documentation:\n\n_file:///my/projects/jupyter_client/docs/\\_build/html/index.html_\n\n## contributing\n\n`jupyter-client` has adopted automatic code formatting so you shouldn't\nneed to worry too much about your code style.\nas long as your code is valid,\nthe pre-commit hook should take care of how it should look.\nyou can invoke the pre-commit hook by hand at any time with:\n\n```bash\npre-commit run\n```\n\nwhich should run any autoformatting on your code\nand tell you about any errors it couldn't fix automatically.\nyou may also install [black integration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html)\ninto your text editor to format code automatically.\n\nif you have already committed files before setting up the pre-commit\nhook with `pre-commit install`, you can fix everything up using\n`pre-commit run --all-files`. you need to make the fixing commit\nyourself after that.\n\nsome of the hooks only run on ci by default, but you can invoke them by\nrunning with the `--hook-stage manual` argument.\n\n## about the jupyter development team\n\nthe jupyter development team is the set of all contributors to the jupyter project.\nthis includes all of the jupyter subprojects.\n\nthe core team that coordinates development on github can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\n\n## our copyright policy\n\njupyter uses a shared copyright model. each contributor maintains copyright\nover their contributions to jupyter. but, it is important to note that these\ncontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. thus, the jupyter\nsource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or\ninstitution. instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire jupyter\ndevelopment team. if individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\nchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\ntheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\nchange to one of the jupyter repositories.\n\nwith this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\nto indicate the copyright and license terms:\n\n```\n# copyright (c) jupyter development team.\n# distributed under the terms of the modified bsd license.\n```\n\n[jupyter protocol]: https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html\n",
