  "description": "microsoft azure cli dev tools (azdev)\n=====================================\n\nthe ``azdev`` tool is designed to aid new and experienced developers in contributing to azure cli command modules and extensions.\n\nsetting up your development environment\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n1. install python 3.6+ from http://python.org. please note that the version of python that comes preinstalled on osx is 2.7.\n\n2. fork and clone the repository or repositories you wish to develop for.\n    - for azure cli: https://github.com/azure/azure-cli\n    - for azure cli extensions: https://github.com/azure/azure-cli-extensions\n    - any other repository that you might have access to that contains cli extensions.\n\n3. create a new virtual environment for python in the root of your clone. you can do this by running:\n\n    python 3.6+ (all platforms):\n\n    ::\n\n        python -m venv env\n\n    or:\n\n    ::\n\n        python3 -m venv env\n\n\n4. activate the env virtual environment by running:\n\n    windows cmd.exe:\n\n    ::\n\n        env\\scripts\\activate.bat\n\n    windows powershell:\n\n    ::\n\n        env\\scripts\\activate.ps1\n\n\n    osx/linux (bash):\n\n    ::\n\n        source env/bin/activate\n\n5. install ``azdev`` by running:\n\n    ::\n\n        pip install azdev\n\n6. complete setup by running:\n\n    ::\n\n        azdev setup\n\n\n    this will launch the interactive setup process. to see non-interactive options run `azdev setup -h`.\n\nreporting issues and feedback\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nif you encounter any bugs with the tool please file an issue in the `issues <https://github.com/azure/azure-cli-dev-tools/issues>`__ section of our github repo.\n\ncontribute code\n+++++++++++++++\n\nthis project has adopted the `microsoft open source code of conduct <https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/>`__.\n\nfor more information see the `code of conduct faq <https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/>`__ or contact `opencode@microsoft.com <mailto:opencode@microsoft.com>`__ with any additional questions or comments.\n\nif you would like to become an active contributor to this project please\nfollow the instructions provided in `microsoft azure projects contribution guidelines

extensions.\n      extensions which have changed based on a git diff.\n- azdev linter:\n    - added `--include-whl-extensions` flag to permit running the linter on extensions installed using\n      the `az extension add` command.\n- azdev verify license:\n    - command will not check any dev-installed cli and extension repos. previously, it only checked the cli repo.\n- new command:\n    -

to azure-cli no longer require this.\n* breaking change: `azdev verify history` and `azdev cli check-versions` no longer accept any arguments. since there are\n  now far fewer modules, these were deemed unnecessary.\n\n0.0.6\n++++++\n* added new commands `azdev cli create` and `azdev extension create` to scaffold new modules/extensions.\n* `azdev setup`: tweaks to interactive experience.\n* `azdev test`: fix issue where using `--profile` did not use the correct index.\n                changed the behavior to switch back to the original profile upon completion of tests.\n\n0.0.5\n++++++\n* fix issue where `azdev cli check-versions` did not accept the short form of a module name.\n* update `azdev cli check-versions` to allow modules as a positional argument, consistent with other azdev commands.\n* fix issue where `azdev test --discover` could result in a stack trace when a virtual environment exists within an extensions repo.\n\n0.0.4\n++++++\n* fix critical bug in `azdev setup`.\n\n0.0.3\n++++++\n* adds new commands `azdev extension build` and `azdev extension publish` to simplify extension publishing.\n* updates default exclusions for `azdev linter` when used on extensions.\n* adds a `--ci-exclusions` flag to `azdev linter` to emulate ci mode when run locally.\n* fix issue where `azdev test --discover` could result in a stack trace when a virtual environment exists within a cloned repo.\n* tweaks thresholds for `azdev per load-times`.\n\n0.0.2\n++++++\n\n* changes the behavior of `azdev test` to, by default, run tests on everything to be consistent with commands like `azdev style` and `azdev linter`.\n* removes `azdev verify version` and splits into two commands `azdev cli check-versions` and `azdev cli update-setup`.\n* various modifications to play nicely with azure-cli's ci build system.\n* revamps `azdev perf load-times` to reduce spurious failures.\n\n0.0.1\n++++++\n* initial release\n",
