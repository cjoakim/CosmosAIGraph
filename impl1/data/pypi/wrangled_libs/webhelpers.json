  "description": "web helpers is a library of helper functions intended to make writing \r\nweb applications easier. it's the standard function library for\r\npylons and turbogears 2, but can be used with any web framework.  it also\r\ncontains a large number of functions not specific to the web, including text\r\nprocessing, number formatting, date calculations, container objects, etc.\r\n\r\nversion 1.3 fixes a performance regression in 1.2 regarding paginate with\r\nsqlalchemy.\r\n\r\nwebhelpers itself depends only on markupsafe, but certain helpers depend on\r\nthird-party packages as described in the docs.\r\n\r\nthe development version of webhelpers is at\r\nhttp://bitbucket.org/bbangert/webhelpers (mercurial)",
