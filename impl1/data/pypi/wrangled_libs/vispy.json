  "description": "vispy: interactive scientific visualization in python\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nmain website: http://vispy.org\n\n|build status| |coverage status| |zenodo link| |contributor covenant|\n\n----\n\nvispy is a **high-performance interactive 2d/3d data visualization\nlibrary**. vispy leverages the computational power of modern **graphics\nprocessing units (gpus)** through the **opengl** library to display very\nlarge datasets. applications of vispy include:\n\n-  high-quality interactive scientific plots with millions of points.\n-  direct visualization of real-time data.\n-  fast interactive visualization of 3d models (meshes, volume\n   rendering).\n-  opengl visualization demos.\n-  scientific guis with fast, scalable visualization widgets (`qt <http://www.qt.io>`__ or\n   `ipython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`__ with webgl).\n\nreleases\n--------\n\nsee `changelog.md <./changelog.md>`_.\n\nannouncements\n-------------\n\nsee the `vispy website <https://vispy.org/news.html>`_.\n\nusing vispy\n-----------\n\nvispy is a young library under heavy development at this time. it\ntargets two categories of users:\n\n1. **users knowing opengl**, or willing to learn opengl, who want to\n   create beautiful and fast interactive 2d/3d visualizations in python\n   as easily as possible.\n2. **scientists without any knowledge of opengl**, who are seeking a\n   high-level, high-performance plotting toolkit.\n\nif you're in the first category, you can already start using vispy.\nvispy offers a pythonic, numpy-aware, user-friendly interface for opengl\nes 2.0 called **gloo**. you can focus on writing your glsl code instead\nof dealing with the complicated opengl api - vispy takes care of that\nautomatically for you.\n\nif you're in the second category, we're starting to build experimental\nhigh-level plotting interfaces. notably, vispy now ships a very basic\nand experimental opengl backend for matplotlib.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nplease follow the detailed\n`installation instructions <http://vispy.org/installation.html>`_\non the vispy website.\n\nstructure of vispy\n------------------\n\ncurrently, the main subpackages are:\n\n-  **app**: integrates an event system and offers a unified interface on\n   top of many window backends (qt4, wx, glfw, jupyter notebook,\n   and others). relatively stable api.\n-  **gloo**: a pythonic, object-oriented interface to opengl. relatively\n   stable api.\n-  **scene**: this is the system underlying our upcoming high level\n   visualization interfaces. under heavy development and still\n   experimental, it contains several modules.\n\n   -  **visuals** are graphical abstractions representing 2d shapes, 3d\n      meshes, text, etc.\n   -  **transforms** implement 2d/3d transformations implemented on both\n      cpu and gpu.\n   -  **shaders** implements a shader composition system for plumbing\n      together snippets of glsl code.\n   -  the **scene graph** tracks all objects within a transformation\n      graph.\n-  **plot**: high-level plotting interfaces.\n\nthe api of all public interfaces are subject to change in the future,\nalthough **app** and **gloo** are *relatively* stable at this point.\n\ncode of conduct\n---------------\n\nthe vispy community requires its members to abide by the\n`code of conduct <./code_of_conduct.md>`_. in this coc you will find the\nexpectations of members, the penalties for violating these expectations, and\nhow violations can be reported to the members of the community in charge of\nenforcing this code of conduct.\n\ngovernance\n----------\n\nthe vispy project maintainers make decisions about the project based on a\nsimple consensus model. this is described in more detail on the\n`governance page <https://vispy.org/governance/governance.html>`_ of the vispy\nwebsite as well as the\n`list of maintainers <https://vispy.org/governance/maintainers.html>`_.\n\nin addition to decisions about the vispy project, there is also a steering\ncommittee for the overall vispy organization. more information about this\ncommittee can also be found on the `steering committee page <https://vispy.org/org/steering-committee.html>`_\nof the vispy website,\nalong with the organization's `charter <https://vispy.org/org/charter.html>`_ and\nother related documents (linked in the charter).\n\ngenesis\n-------\n\nvispy began when four developers with their own visualization libraries\ndecided to team up:\n`luke campagnola <http://luke.campagnola.me/>`__ with `pyqtgraph <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`__,\n`almar klein <http://www.almarklein.org/>`__ with `visvis <https://github.com/almarklein/visvis>`__,\n`cyrille rossant <http://cyrille.rossant.net>`__ with `galry <https://github.com/rossant/galry>`__,\n`nicolas rougier <http://www.loria.fr/~rougier/index.html>`__ with `glumpy <https://github.com/rougier/glumpy>`__.\n\nnow vispy looks to build on the expertise of these developers and the\nbroader open-source community to build a high-performance opengl library.\n\n----\n\nexternal links\n--------------\n\n-  `user mailing\n   list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vispy>`__\n-  `dev mailing\n   list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vispy-dev>`__\n-  `chat room <https://gitter.im/vispy/vispy>`__\n-  `developer chat room <https://gitter.im/vispy/vispy-dev>`__\n-  `wiki <http://github.com/vispy/vispy/wiki>`__\n-  `gallery <http://vispy.org/gallery.html>`__\n-  `documentation <http://vispy.readthedocs.org>`__\n\n.. |build status| image:: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/workflows/ci/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/actions\n.. |coverage status| image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/vispy/vispy/main.svg\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/vispy/vispy?branch=main\n.. |zenodo link| image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/5822/vispy/vispy.svg\n   :target: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17869\n.. |contributor covenant| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/contributor%20covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg\n   :target: code_of_conduct.md\n",
