  "description": "universal scene description (usd) is a system that scalably encodes and\ninterchanges static and time-sampled 3d geometry, shading and lighting data\nbetween digital content creation applications. domain-specific schema modules\ndefine the geometry, shading, and lighting encoding atop usd's domain-agnostic\ncore. it provides a low-level data model that supports plugin implementations,\nand a scenegraph built on top of a multi-threaded \"composition engine\" for\ncreating complex scenes out of reusable, modular assets.\n\nthis package provides the core usd libraries. it does not provide any of\nthe optional plugins or imaging features from the full usd distribution.\n",
