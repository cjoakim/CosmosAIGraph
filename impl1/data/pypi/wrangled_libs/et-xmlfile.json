  "description": "et_xmfile\n=========\n\net_xmlfile is a low memory library for creating large xml files.\n\nit is based upon the `xmlfile module from lxml <http://lxml.de/api.html#incremental-xml-generation>`_ with the aim of allowing code to be developed that will work with both libraries. it was developed initially for the openpyxl project but is now a standalone module.\n\nthe code was written by elias rabel as part of the `python d\u00fcsseldorf <http://pyddf.de>`_ openpyxl sprint in september 2014.\n\n\nnote on performance\n-------------------\n\nthe code was not developed with performance in mind but turned out to be faster than the existing sax-based implementation but is significantly slower than lxml's xmlfile. there is one area where an optimisation for lxml will negatively affect the performance of et_xmfile and that is when using the `.element()` method on an xmlfile context manager. it is, therefore, recommended not to use this, though the method is provided for code compatibility.\n\n\n",
