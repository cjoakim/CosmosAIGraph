  "description": "mpld3: a d3 viewer for matplotlib\n=================================\n\n- maintainers: [@vladh](https://github.com/vladh), [@cliffckerr](https://github.com/cliffckerr)\n- status: i ([@vladh](https://github.com/vladh)) am not currently able to dedicate much time to resolving mpld3 issues.\n  however, i _will_ gladly look at your pull request and review it. please try your hand at fixing any issues you\n  may have and sending a pr rather than just filing an issue \u2014 most problems don't take as long as you might expect to\n  figure out!\n- original author: jake vanderplas <jakevdp@cs.washington.edu>\n- license: bsd 3-clause\n\nthis is an interactive d3js-based viewer which brings matplotlib graphics to the browser.\nplease visit [http://mpld3.github.io](http://mpld3.github.io) for documentation and examples.\n\nyou may also see the [blog post](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/12/19/a-d3-viewer-for-matplotlib/), or the\n[ipython notebook examples](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/mpld3/tree/master/notebooks/)\navailable in the ``notebooks`` directory of this repository.\n\n[![version status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mpld3.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpld3)\n[![downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/mpld3.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpld3)\n[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/jakevdp/mpld3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jakevdp/mpld3)\n\n\nabout\n-----\nmpld3 provides a custom stand-alone javascript library built on d3, which\nparses json representations of plots.  the mpld3 python module provides a\nset of routines which parses matplotlib plots (using the \n[mplexporter](http://github.com/mpld3/mplexporter) framework) and outputs\nthe json description readable by mpld3.js.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\nmpld3 is compatible with python 2.6-2.7 and 3.3-3.4. it requires\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) version 2.2.2 and\n[jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) version 2.7+.\n\noptionally, mpld3 can be used with [ipython](http://ipython.org) notebook,\nand requires ipython version 1.x or (preferably) version 2.0+.\n\nthis package is based on the [mplexporter](http://github.com/mpld3/mplexporter)\nframework for crawling and exporting matplotlib images. mplexporter is bundled\nwith the source distribution via git submodule.\n\nwithin the git source directory, you can download the mplexporter dependency\nand copy it into the mpld3 source directory using the following command:\n\n    $ python setup.py submodule\n\nthe submodule command is not necessary if you are installing from a distribution\nrather than from the git source.\n\nonce the submodule command has been run, you can build the package locally using\n\n    $ python -m build\n\nor install the package to the standard python path using:\n\n    $ pip install .\n\nor, to install to another location, use\n\n    $ pip install . --prefix=/path/to/location/\n\nthen make sure your pythonpath environment variable points to this location.\n\ntrying it out\n-------------\nthe package is pure python, and very light-weight.  you can take a look at\nthe notebooks in the examples directory, or run ``create_example.py``, which\nwill create a set of plots and launch a browser window showing interactive\nviews of these plots.\n\nfor a more comprehensive set of examples, see the\n[ipython notebook examples](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/mpld3/tree/master/notebooks/) available in the ``notebooks`` directory.\n\ntest plots\n----------\nto explore the comparison between d3 renderings and matplotlib renderings for\nvarious plot types, run the script ``visualize_tests.py``.  this will generate\nan html page with the d3 renderings beside corresponding matplotlib renderings.\n\nfeatures\n--------\nmany of the core features of matplotlib are already supported.  and additionally\nthere is some extra interactivity provided via the plugin framework.  the\nfollowing is a non-exhausive list of features that are yet to be supported:\n\n- tick specification & formatting\n- some legend features\n- blended transforms, such as those required by ``axvlines`` and ``axhlines``\n- twin axes (i.e. multiple scales on one plot) tied together\n\nif any of these look like something you'd like to tackle, feel free to submit\na pull request!\n",
