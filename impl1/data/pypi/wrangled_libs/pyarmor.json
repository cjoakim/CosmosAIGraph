  "description": "protect python scripts by pyarmor\n=================================\n\npyarmor is a command line tool used to obfuscate python scripts, bind obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscated scripts.\n\nkey features\n------------\n\n* the obfuscated scritpt is still a normal `.py` script, in most of cases the original python scripts can be replaced with obfuscated scripts seamlessly.\n* provide many ways to obfuscate the scripts to balance security and performance\n* rename functions/methods/classes/variables/arguments, irreversible obfuscation\n* convert part of python functions to c function, compile to binary by high optimize option, irreversible obfuscation\n* bind obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscted scripts\n* protect obfuscated scripts by themida (only for windows)\n\nsupport platforms\n-----------------\n\n* python 3.7~3.12\n* windows\n* many linuxs, include embedded systems\n* apple intel and apple silicon\n\nquick start\n-----------\n\ninstall::\n\n    pip install pyarmor\n\nobfuscate the script `foo.py`::\n\n    pyarmor gen foo.py\n\nthis command generates an obfuscated script `dist/foo.py` like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__\n    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\\x28\\x83\\x20\\x58....')\n\nrun it::\n\n    python dist/foo.py\n\nmore resources\n--------------\n\n- `home <https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor>`_\n- `website <http://pyarmor.dashingsoft.com>`_\n- `\u4e2d\u6587\u7f51\u7ad9 <http://pyarmor.dashingsoft.com/index-zh.html>`_\n- `issues <https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor/issues>`_\n- `documentation <https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/>`_",
