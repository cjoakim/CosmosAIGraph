  "description": "\n=======\nsegy io\n=======\n\nhttps://segyio.readthedocs.io\n\nintroduction\n------------\n\nsegyio is a small lgpl licensed c library for easy interaction with seg y\nformatted seismic data, with language bindings for python and matlab. segyio is\nan attempt to create an easy-to-use, embeddable, community-oriented library for\nseismic applications. features are added as they are needed; suggestions and\ncontributions of all kinds are very welcome.\n\nfeature summary\n---------------\n * a low-level c interface with few assumptions; easy to bind to other\n   languages.\n * read and write binary and textual headers.\n * read and write traces, trace headers.\n * easy to use and native-feeling python interface with numpy integration.\n\nproject goals\n-------------\n\nsegyio does necessarily attempt to be the end-all of seg-y interactions;\nrather, we aim to lower the barrier to interacting with seg-y files for\nembedding, new applications or free-standing programs.\n\nadditionally, the aim is not to support the full standard or all exotic (but\ncorrectly) formatted files out there. some assumptions are made, such as:\n\n * all traces in a file are assumed to be of the same sample size.\n * it is assumed all lines have the same number of traces.\n\nthe writing functionality in segyio is largely meant to *modify* or adapt\nfiles. a file created from scratch is not necessarily a to-spec seg-y file, as\nwe only necessarily write the header fields segyio needs to make sense of the\ngeometry. it is still highly recommended that seg-y files are maintained and\nwritten according to specification, but segyio does not mandate this.\n\n",
