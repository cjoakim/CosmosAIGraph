  "description": "# google fhirproto\n\n## introduction\nthis is the python3 distribution for google [fhirproto](http://github.com/google/fhir).\n\nfhirproto is google's implementation of the [fhir standard](http://hl7.org/fhir/) for health care data using [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).  by leveraging google\u2019s core data storage format, fhirproto provides a type-safe, strongly validated fhir format with cross-language support at a fraction of the size on disk, making it a great data model to develop your health care application on.  structured codes and extensions guarantee that your data will be in the correct format.  support for generating and validating against custom implementation guides allow you to customize fhirproto to your dataset and requirements.  parsing and printing libraries make it easy to go back and forth between fhirproto format and json.\n\n## getting started\n\n### installation\n\nyou can install the python3 distribution of fhirproto with for use with python interpreters >=3.6, <3.9 using the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package manager. we strongly recommend installing into a python3 virtual environment, such as [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):\n```sh\npython3 -m venv fhir\nsource fhir/bin/activate\n\npip install --upgrade setuptools\npip install google-fhir\n```\n\n### examples and documentation\nwe think the best way to get an idea of how fhirproto works is to get in and start playing with it.  to that end, we provide [https://github.com/google/fhir-examples](https://github.com/google/fhir-examples). this repo contains a script for using [synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) to create a synthetic fhir json dataset, and then shows some examples of parsing, printing, validating, profiling and querying.  the repo also contains a [walkthrough](https://github.com/google/fhir-examples/blob/master/examples.md) of many of the examples.\n\na reference user guide with in-depth descriptions of different concepts can be found [here](https://github.com/google/fhir-examples/blob/master/userguide.md).\n\n## trademark\nfhir\u00ae is the registered trademark of hl7 and is used with the permission of hl7. use of the fhir trademark does not constitute endorsement of this product by hl7.\n\n\n",
