more details in `examples/example_1.py`\n\n    @pytest.mark.datafiles('/opt/big_files/film1.mp4')\n    def test_fast_forward(datafiles):\n        # ...\n\n\nexample 2\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nnow for another use case: let's say in the directory where your tests are located, you\nplace a directory named *test_files*. here you have a lot of images you want to run tests\non. by using this plugin, you make sure the original files under *test_files* are not\nmodified by every test.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # more details in `examples/example_2.py`\n\n    @pytest.mark.datafiles(\n        fixture_dir / 'img1.jpg',\n        fixture_dir / 'img2.jpg',\n        fixture_dir / 'img3.jpg',\n    )\n    def test_find_borders(datafiles):\n        # ...\n\n\nexample 3\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nif all (or many) of your tests rely on the same files it can be easier to\ndefine one decorator beforehand and apply it to every test like this example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # more details in `examples/example_3.py`\n\n    all_imgs = pytest.mark.datafiles(\n        fixture_dir / 'img1.jpg',\n        fixture_dir / 'img2.jpg',\n        fixture_dir / 'img3.jpg',\n    )\n\n    @all_imgs\n    def test_something1(datafiles):\n        # ...\n\n\nexample 4\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nimagine you have 3 directories (*dir1*, *dir2*, *dir3*) each containing the files\n(*filea* and *fileb*).\n\nthis example clarifies the options **on_duplicate** and **keep_top_dir**.\n\n\nexample 5\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nyou can also use a str paths.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # more details in `examples/example_5.py`\n\n    @pytest.mark.datafiles(\n        os.path.join(fixture_dir, 'img1.jpg'),\n        os.path.join(fixture_dir, 'img2.jpg'),\n        os.path.join(fixture_dir, 'img3.jpg'),\n    )\n    def test_str(datafiles):\n        # ...\n\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\ncontributions are very welcome. tests can be run with `tox`_. please\nensure the coverage stays at least the same before you submit a pull\nrequest.\n\nto create and upload a new package first update the version number and then:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip3 install --user -u twine\n    make clean\n    make dist\n    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*\n    # verify the package is usable\n    virtualenv -p python3 test-venv\n    test-venv/bin/pip install pytest\n    test-venv/bin/pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pytest-datafiles\n    # create some test_example.py (e.g. with one of the examples above)\n    test-venv/bin/pytest test_example.py\n    # set the git tag for final release\n    git tag -a 3.0\n    git push --tags\n    # upload the package for final release\n    twine upload dist/*\n\nfinally create a release on github and add the packages from dist/* to it.\n\nof course this will only work if you have the necessary pypi credentials for\nthis package.\n\n\nlicense\n-------\n\ndistributed under the terms of the `mit license`_, \"pytest-datafiles\" is\nfree and open source software.\n\n\nissues\n------\n\nif you encounter any problems, please `file an issue`_ along with a\ndetailed description.\n\n\nacknowledgements\n----------------\n\nthanks to `@flub`_ for the idea to use `pytest`_ marks to solve the\nproblem this plugin is trying to solve.\n\nsome ideas to improve this project were taken from the `cookiecutter`_\ntemplates `cookiecutter-pypackage`_ and `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_.\n\n\n.. _`pytest`: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html\n.. _`tmp_path`: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/tmp_path.html\n.. _`tox`: https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _`mit license`: http://opensource.org/licenses/mit\n.. _`file an issue`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/issues\n.. _`@flub`: https://github.com/flub\n.. _`cookiecutter`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _`cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\n.. _`cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin\n\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nchange log\n----------\n\nall notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nthis project adheres to `semantic versioning`_. the change log is\nformatted as suggested by `keep a changelog`_.\n\n`unreleased`_\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nadded\nchanged\ndeprecated\nremoved\nfixed\nsecurity\n\n`3.0`_\n~~~~~~\n\nchanged\n\n* breaking change: using `pathlib.path` instead of `py.path` (`#7`_)\n* breaking change: removed support for python 2.7 and python 3 <= 3.6\n\n`2.0.1`_\n~~~~~~~~\n\nfixed\n\n* register custom marker 'datafiles' to avoid pytestunknownmarkwarning\n  (`#18`_)\n\n`2.0`_\n~~~~~~\n\nadded\n\n* explicit support for python 3.6 (no changes were necessary)\n\nremoved\n\n* breaking change: python 2.6 is no longer supported (because we rely on pytest\n  >= 3.6)\n\nfixed\n\n* use the new pytest mark api to fix markinfo warnings (`#2`_)\n* breaking change: symlinks are now copied as links instead of copying the\n  target they point to (`#1`_)\n\n`1.0`_\n~~~~~~\n\nchanged\n\n* bump version to 1.0 to signal that the plugin is stable\n* minor refactorization without repercussions for users\n* only use regular 'paths' (str) instead of py.path objects in documentation\n  examples because they were confusing to some people (unfamiliar with py.path)\n\n`0.2`_\n~~~~~~\n\nadded\n\n* support for directories\n* option 'keep_top_dir' to keep the top level directory (instead of only\n  copying its content). possible values are: true, false (default)\n* option 'on_duplicate' to specify what to do when duplicate files or\n  directories are encountered. possible values are: 'exception' (default),\n  'ignore', 'overwrite'\n\n`0.1`_\n~~~~~~\n\nadded\n\n* specify one or multiple files to be copied by decorating the test\n  function\n\n\n.. _`unreleased`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/compare/3.0...master\n.. _`3.0`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/compare/2.0.1...3.0\n.. _`2.0.1`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/compare/2.0...2.0.1\n.. _`2.0`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/compare/1.0...2.0\n.. _`1.0`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/compare/0.2...1.0\n.. _`0.2`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/compare/0.1...0.2\n.. _`0.1`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/compare/3c31b2c...0.1\n\n\n.. _`#1`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/issues/1\n.. _`#2`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/issues/2\n.. _`#7`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/issues/7\n.. _`#18`: https://github.com/omarkohl/pytest-datafiles/issues/18\n\n\n.. _`semantic versioning`: http://semver.org/\n.. _`keep a changelog`: http://keepachangelog.com/\n\n\n",
