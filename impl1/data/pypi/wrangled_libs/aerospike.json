  "description": "aerospike python client\n=======================\n|build| |release| |wheel| |downloads| |license|\n\n.. |build| image:: https://travis-ci.org/aerospike/aerospike-client-python.svg?branch=master\n.. |release| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aerospike.svg\n.. |wheel| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/wheel/aerospike.svg\n.. |downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/aerospike.svg\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/aerospike.svg\n\ncompatibility\n-------------\n\nthe python client for aerospike works with python 3.8 - 3.11 and supports the following os'es:\n\n* macos 11 and 12\n* centos 7 linux\n* rhel 8 and 9\n* amazon linux 2023\n* debian 11 and 12\n* ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04\n\nthe client is also verified to run on these operating systems, but we do not officially support them (i.e we don't distribute wheels or prioritize fixing bugs for these oses):\n\n* alpine linux\n\n**note:** aerospike python client 5.0.0 and up must be used with aerospike server 4.9 or later.\nif you see the error \"-10, \u2018failed to connect\u2019\", please make sure you are using server 4.9 or later.\n\ninstall\n-------\n\n::\n\n    pip install aerospike\n\nin most cases ``pip`` will install a precompiled binary (wheel) matching your os\nand version of python. if a matching wheel isn't found it, or the\n``--install-option`` argument is provided, pip will build the python client\nfrom source.\n\nplease see the `build instructions <https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/blob/master/build.md>`__\nfor more.\n\ntroubleshooting\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::\n\n    # client >=3.8.0 will attempt a manylinux wheel installation for linux distros\n    # to force a pip install from source:\n    pip install aerospike --no-binary :all:\n\n    # to troubleshoot pip versions >= 6.0 you can\n    pip install --no-cache-dir aerospike\n\nif you run into trouble installing the client on a supported os, you may be\nusing an outdated ``pip``.\nversions of ``pip`` older than 7.0.0 should be upgraded, as well as versions of\n``setuptools`` older than 18.0.0.\n\n\ntroubleshooting macos\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nin some versions of macos, python 2.7 is installed as ``python`` with\n``pip`` as its associated package manager, and python 3 is installed as ``python3``\nwith ``pip3`` as the associated package manager. make sure to use the ones that\nmap to python 3, such as ``pip3 install aerospike``.\n\nattempting to install the client with pip for the system default python may cause permissions issues when copying necessary files. in order to avoid\nthose issues the client can be installed for the current user only with the command: ``pip install --user aerospike``\n\n::\n\n    # to trouleshoot installation on macos try\n    pip install --no-cache-dir --user aerospike\n\n\nbuild\n-----\n\nfor instructions on manually building the python client, please refer to\n`build.md <https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/blob/master/build.md>`__.\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\ndocumentation is hosted at `aerospike-python-client.readthedocs.io <https://aerospike-python-client.readthedocs.io/>`__\nand at `aerospike.com/apidocs/python <http://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/python/>`__.\n\nexamples\n--------\n\nexample applications are provided in the `examples directory of the github repository <https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/tree/master/examples/client>`__\n\nfor examples, to run the ``kvs.py``:\n\n::\n\n    python examples/client/kvs.py\n\n\nbenchmarks\n----------\n\nto run the benchmarks the python module 'tabulate' need to be installed. in order to display heap information the module `guppy` must be installed.\nnote that `guppy` is only available for python2. if `guppy` is not installed the benchmarks will still be runnable.\nbenchmark applications are provided in the `benchmarks directory of the github repository <https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/tree/master/benchmarks>`__\n\nby default the benchmarks will try to connect to a server located at 127.0.0.1:3000 , instructions on changing that setting and other command line flags may be displayed by appending the `--help` argument to the benchmark script. for example:\n::\n\n    python benchmarks/keygen.py --help\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nthe aerospike python client is made availabled under the terms of the\napache license, version 2, as stated in the file ``license``.\n\nindividual files may be made available under their own specific license,\nall compatible with apache license, version 2. please see individual\nfiles for details.\n",
