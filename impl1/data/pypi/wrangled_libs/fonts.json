  "description": "python fonts\n============\n\na python framework for distributing and managing fonts.\n\nwhy\n===\n\nwhile python can access system fonts, it has no direct way of guaranteeing a particular font is available, or any way of including it as a dependency.\n\nfonts aims to tackle this problem with tools for packaging and distributing fonts via pypi, which can be easily located and used in python using pil or otherwise.\n\nhow\n===\n\nfonts uses ``entry_points`` to expose the font files located in each package.\n\nto use these fonts in your project you should include them as a dependency and either grab the font paths using ``pkg_resources.iter_entry_points('fonts_ttf')`` or use this fonts module to collate them for you.\n\nfor example::\n\n    from pil import imagefont\n    from fonts.ttf import amaticsc\n    font = imagefont.truetype(amaticsc)\n\nfonts\n=====\n\n- fredoka one (sans-serif, ofl) - https://pypi.org/project/font-fredoka-one\n- amatic sc (hand-drawn, ofl) - https://pypi.org/project/font-amatic-sc\n\n\n0.0.3\n=====\n\n- added otf support\n\n\n",
