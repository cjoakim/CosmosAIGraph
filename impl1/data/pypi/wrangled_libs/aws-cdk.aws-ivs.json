  "description": "# aws::ivs construct library\n\n<!--begin stability banner-->---\n\n\n![end-of-support](https://img.shields.io/badge/end--of--support-critical.svg?style=for-the-badge)\n\n> aws cdk v1 has reached end-of-support on 2023-06-01.\n> this package is no longer being updated, and users should migrate to aws cdk v2.\n>\n> for more information on how to migrate, see the [*migrating to aws cdk v2* guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/migrating-v2.html).\n\n---\n<!--end stability banner-->\n\namazon interactive video service (amazon ivs) is a managed live streaming\nsolution that is quick and easy to set up, and ideal for creating interactive\nvideo experiences. send your live streams to amazon ivs using streaming software\nand the service does everything you need to make low-latency live video\navailable to any viewer around the world, letting you focus on building\ninteractive experiences alongside the live video. you can easily customize and\nenhance the audience experience through the amazon ivs player sdk and timed\nmetadata apis, allowing you to build a more valuable relationship with your\nviewers on your own websites and applications.\n\nthis module is part of the [aws cloud development kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.\n\n## channels\n\nan amazon ivs channel stores configuration information related to your live\nstream. you first create a channel and then contribute video to it using the\nchannel\u2019s stream key to start your live stream.\n\nyou can create a channel\n\n```python\nmy_channel = ivs.channel(self, \"channel\")\n```\n\n### importing an existing channel\n\nyou can reference an existing channel, for example, if you need to create a\nstream key for an existing channel\n\n```python\nmy_channel = ivs.channel.from_channel_arn(self, \"channel\", my_channel_arn)\n```\n\n## stream keys\n\na stream key is used by a broadcast encoder to initiate a stream and identify\nto amazon ivs which customer and channel the stream is for. if you are\nstoring this value, it should be treated as if it were a password.\n\nyou can create a stream key for a given channel\n\n```python\nmy_stream_key = my_channel.add_stream_key(\"streamkey\")\n```\n\n## private channels\n\namazon ivs offers the ability to create private channels, allowing\nyou to restrict your streams by channel or viewer. you control access\nto video playback by enabling playback authorization on channels and\ngenerating signed json web tokens (jwts) for authorized playback requests.\n\na playback token is a jwt that you sign (with a playback authorization key)\nand include with every playback request for a channel that has playback\nauthorization enabled.\n\nin order for amazon ivs to validate the token, you need to upload\nthe public key that corresponds to the private key you use to sign the token.\n\n```python\nkey_pair = ivs.playbackkeypair(self, \"playbackkeypair\",\n    public_key_material=my_public_key_pem_string\n)\n```\n\nthen, when creating a channel, specify the authorized property\n\n```python\nmy_channel = ivs.channel(self, \"channel\",\n    authorized=true\n)\n```\n",
