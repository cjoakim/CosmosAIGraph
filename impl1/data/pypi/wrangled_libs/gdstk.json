the real improvement is heavily dependent on the type of layout and features used.\nif maximal performance is important, the library should be used directly from c++, without the python interface.\n\ntiming results were obtained with python 3.11 on an intel core i7-9750h @ 2.60 ghz\nthey represent the best average time to run each function out of 16 sets of 8 runs each.\n\n| benchmark        |   gdspy 1.6.13   |   gdstk 0.9.41   |   gain   |\n| :--------------- | :--------------: | :--------------: | :------: |\n| 10k_rectangles   |     80.2 ms      |     4.87 ms      |   16.5   |\n| 1k_circles       |      312 ms      |      239 ms      |   1.3    |\n| boolean-offset   |      187 \u03bcs      |     44.7 \u03bcs      |   4.19   |\n| bounding_box     |     36.7 ms      |      170 \u03bcs      |   216    |\n| curves           |     1.52 ms      |     30.9 \u03bcs      |   49.3   |\n| flatten          |      465 \u03bcs      |     8.17 \u03bcs      |   56.9   |\n| flexpath         |     2.88 ms      |     16.1 \u03bcs      |   178    |\n| flexpath-param   |      2.8 ms      |      585 \u03bcs      |   4.78   |\n| fracture         |      929 \u03bcs      |      616 \u03bcs      |   1.51   |\n| inside           |      161 \u03bcs      |      33 \u03bcs       |   4.88   |\n| read_gds         |     2.68 ms      |      94 \u03bcs       |   28.5   |\n| read_rawcells    |      363 \u03bcs      |     52.4 \u03bcs      |   6.94   |\n| robustpath       |      171 \u03bcs      |     8.68 \u03bcs      |   19.7   |\n\nmemory usage per object for 100000 objects:\n\n| object               |   gdspy 1.6.13   |   gdstk 0.9.41   | reduction |\n| :------------------- | :--------------: | :--------------: | :-------: |\n| rectangle            |      601 b       |      232 b       |    61%    |\n| circle (r = 10)      |     1.68 kb      |     1.27 kb      |    24%    |\n| flexpath segment     |     1.48 kb      |      439 b       |    71%    |\n| flexpath arc         |     2.26 kb      |     1.49 kb      |    34%    |\n| robustpath segment   |     2.89 kb      |      920 b       |    69%    |\n| robustpath arc       |     2.66 kb      |      920 b       |    66%    |\n| label                |      407 b       |      215 b       |    47%    |\n| reference            |      160 b       |      179 b       |    -12%   |\n| reference (array)    |      189 b       |      181 b       |     4%    |\n| cell                 |      430 b       |      229 b       |    47%    |\n",
