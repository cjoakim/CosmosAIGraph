  "description": "# extensions and monkey-patching for django-stubs\n\n[![build status](https://travis-ci.com/typeddjango/django-stubs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/typeddjango/django-stubs)\n[![checked with mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/static/mypy_badge.svg)](http://mypy-lang.org/)\n[![gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/mypy-django/lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/mypy-django/lobby)\n\n\nthis package contains extensions and monkey-patching functions for the [django-stubs](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs) package. certain features of django-stubs (i.e. generic django classes that don't define the `__class_getitem__` method) require runtime monkey-patching, which can't be done with type stubs. these extensions were split into a separate package so library consumers don't need `mypy` as a runtime dependency ([#526](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs/pull/526#pullrequestreview-525798031)).\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\npip install django-stubs-ext\n```\n\n## usage\n\nin your django application, use the following code:\n\n```py\nimport django_stubs_ext\n\ndjango_stubs_ext.monkeypatch()\n```\n\nthis only needs to be called once, so the call to `monkeypatch` should be placed in your top-level settings.\nreal-life example [can be found here](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-django-template/blob/5bf1569e2710e11befc6991893f94419136d74bd/%7b%7bcookiecutter.project_name%7d%7d/server/settings/__init__.py#l14-l19).\n\n## version compatibility\n\nsince django-stubs supports multiple django versions, this package takes care to only monkey-patch the features needed by your django version, and decides which features to patch at runtime. this is completely safe, as (currently) we only add a `__class_getitem__` method that does nothing:\n\n```py\n@classmethod\ndef __class_getitem__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n    return cls\n```\n\n## to get help\n\nfor help with django-stubs, please view the main repository at <https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs>\n\nwe have a gitter chat here: <https://gitter.im/mypy-django/lobby>\nif you think you have a more generic typing issue, please refer to <https://github.com/python/mypy> and their gitter.\n\n## contributing\n\nthe django-stubs-ext package is part of the [django-stubs](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs) monorepo. if you would like to contribute, please view the django-stubs [contribution guide](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs/blob/master/contributing.md).\n\nyou can always also reach out in gitter to discuss your contributions!\n",
