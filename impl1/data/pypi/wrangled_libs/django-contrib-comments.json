since django 1.6 it's been\nseparated to a separate project. this is that project.\n\nthis framework can be used to attach comments to any model, so you can use it\nfor comments on blog entries, photos, book chapters, or anything else.\n\nfor details, `consult the documentation`__.\n\n__ https://django-contrib-comments.readthedocs.io/\n.. :changelog:\n\nhistory\n=======\n\n2.2.0 (2022-01-31)\n------------------\n\n* confirmed support for django 4.0.\n\n2.1.0 (2021-03-03)\n------------------\n\n* dropped support for django 1.11, 2.0, and 2.1.\n* added the ``delete_stale_comments`` management command.\n* added db_index to ``object_pk`` and ``is_removed`` fields.\n* altered ``object_pk`` from ``textfield`` to ``charfield(max_length=64)``\n  so that the field can be indexed on mysql, too. **warning:** if you attach\n  comments to objects whose primary key is serialized to more than 64\n  characters, you should provide a custom comment model\n  (more about that in the documentation) with an appropriate\n  ``object_pk`` field.\n* confirmed support for python 3.9.\n* added support for django 3.2.\n\n2.0.0 (2020-12-20)\n------------------\n\n* removed support for python 2.\n* renamed zh_cn to zh_hans and zh_tw to zh_hant to match\n  django chinese translations naming.\n* confirmed support for django 3.1 and avoid deprecation warnings.\n* confirmed support for python 3.8.\n* updated arabic and german translations.\n\n1.9.2 (2019-12-03)\n------------------\n\n* warning: this *is* the last version supporting python 2.\n* confirmed support for django 3.0.\n* prevented deprecation warnings with django 3.0.\n* updated danish and indonesian translations.\n\n1.9.1 (2019-02-20)\n------------------\n\n* warning: this is most probably the last version supporting python 2.\n* added testing for python 3.7.\n* confirmed support for django 2.2 (no code changes required).\n* updated translations.\n\n1.9.0 (2018-08-04)\n------------------\n\n* added testing for python 3.6.\n* confirmed support for django 2.0 and 2.1.\n* dropped support for django < 1.11.\n* ``ip_address`` is set to none when ``remote_addr`` is empty (#93).\n\n1.8.0 (2017-02-03)\n------------------\n\n* fixed a packaging error which caused sub-packages of the tests to be\n  distributed.\n* use ``get_current_site`` to look up the site instead of ``settings.site_id``.\n* confirmed support for django 1.11.\n* dropped django 1.7 and python 3.2/3.3 support.\n* added testing for python 3.5.\n* updated translations.\n\n1.7.3 (2016-09-13)\n------------------\n\n* fixed a regression which prevented the ``comment`` model\n  from registering with the admin.\n* updated translations.\n\n1.7.2 (2016-08-04)\n------------------\n\n* ``get_comment_list`` now returns a ``queryset`` instead of a ``list``.\n* fixed a django 1.9+ compatibility issue with a customized comment app in\n  ``installed_apps`` (#87).\n* confirmed support for django 1.10.\n\n1.7.1 (2016-05-03)\n------------------\n\n* isolated abstract models outside of models.py so they can be imported without\n  triggering django's deprecation warning about models living outside of a\n  'models' module.\n* updated translations.\n\n1.7.0 (2016-03-29)\n------------------\n\n* dropped django 1.6 and python 2.6 support\n* improved usage of ``appconfig`` functionality for custom models.\n* added ``commentabstractmodel`` as another abstract model layer for easier\n  customization.\n* avoided n+1 query problem for users on comments.\n* made the moderation email subject translatable.\n* added a database index to ``comment.submit_date``, since it is used for the\n  default ordering.\n* fixed packaging so locale files are distributed.\n* updated translations.\n\n1.6.2 (2016-12-10)\n------------------\n\n* fixed some django deprecation warnings.\n* setup translation system using transifex.\n* added missing south migration for the email length.\n* updated translations.\n\n1.6.1 (2016-05-08)\n------------------\n\n* fixed migrations not working when installed as an egg.\n\n\n1.6.0 (2016-04-29)\n------------------\n\n* made ``commentsecurityform`` pass keyword arguments to its parent class.\n* added ``comments_timeout`` setting to configure the timeout for\n  ``commentsecurityform``.\n* migrated ``comment.user_email`` to 254 characters.\n* moved south migrations to ``south_migrations`` folder so they can exist with\n  django 1.7 migrations.\n* added django 1.9 compatibility, dropped support for django 1.5.\n\n\n",
