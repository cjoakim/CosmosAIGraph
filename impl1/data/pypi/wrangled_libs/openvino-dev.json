the [openvino legacy features and components page](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.2/openvino_legacy_features.html).\n\nintel\u00ae distribution of openvino\u2122 toolkit is an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying ai inference. it can be used to develop applications and solutions based on deep learning tasks, such as: emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, etc. it provides high-performance and rich deployment options, from edge to cloud.\n\nopenvino\u2122 development tools enables you to download models from open model zoo, convert your own models to openvino ir, as well as optimize and tune pre-trained deep learning models. see [what's in the package](#whats-in-the-package) for more information.\n\n## system requirements\n\nbefore you start the installation, check the supported operating systems and required python* versions. the complete list of supported hardware is available in the [system requirements](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/system-requirements.html).\n\n**c++ libraries** are also required for the installation on windows*. to install that, you can [download the visual studio redistributable file (.exe)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).\n\n> **note**: this package can be installed on other versions of macos, linux and windows, but only the specific versions above are fully validated.\n\n## install the openvino\u2122 development tools package\n\nthere are two options to install openvino development tools: installation into an existing environment with a deep learning framework used for model training or creation;\nor installation in a new environment.\n\n### installation into an existing environment with the source deep learning framework\n\nto install openvino development tools (see the [what's in the package](#whats-in-the-package) section of this article) into an existing environment\nwith the source deep learning framework used for model training or creation, run the following command:\n```\npip install openvino-dev\n```\n\n### installation in a new environment\n\nif you do not have an environment with the source deep learning framework for the input model or you encounter any compatibility issues between openvino and your version of deep learning framework,\nyou may install openvino development tools with validated versions of frameworks into a new environment.\n\n#### step 1. set up python virtual environment\n\nuse a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.\n\nto create a virtual environment, use the following commands:\n\non windows:\n```sh\npython -m venv openvino_env\n```\n\non linux and macos:\n```sh\npython3 -m venv openvino_env\n```\n\n> **note**: on linux and macos, you may need to [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). for example, on ubuntu execute the following command to get pip installed: `sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip`.\n\n#### step 2. activate virtual environment\n\non linux and macos:\n```sh\nsource openvino_env/bin/activate\n```\non windows:\n```sh\nopenvino_env\\scripts\\activate\n```\n\n#### step 3. set up and update pip to the highest version\n\nrun the command below:\n```sh\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\n#### step 4. install the package\n\nuse the following command:\n```sh\npip install openvino-dev[extras]\n```\n where `extras` is the source deep learning framework for the input model and is one or more of the following values separated with \",\" :\n\n| extras value                    | dl framework                                                                     |\n|

example, to install and configure the components for working with tensorflow 2.x and onnx models, use the following command:\n   ```sh\n   pip install openvino-dev[tensorflow2,onnx]\n   ```\n> **note**: model conversion api support for tensorflow 1.x environment has been deprecated. use tensorflow 2.x environment to convert both tensorflow 1.x and 2.x models.\n\n> **note**: on macos, you may need to enclose the package name in quotes: `pip install \"openvino-dev[extras]\"`.\n\n## how to verify that the package is installed\n\n- to verify that the **developer package** is properly installed, run the command below (this may take a few seconds):\n   ```sh\n   mo -h\n   ```\n   you will see the help message for ``mo`` if installation finished successfully.\n\n- to verify that openvino runtime from the **runtime package** is available, run the command below:\n   ```sh\n   python -c \"from openvino.runtime import core; print(core().available_devices)\"\n   ```\n   if installation was successful, you will see a list of available devices.\n\n<a id=\"whats-in-the-package\"></a>\n\n## what's in the package?\n\n> **note**: the openvino-dev package installs [openvino\u2122 runtime](https://pypi.org/project/openvino) as a dependency, which is the engine that runs the deep learning model and includes a set of libraries for an easy inference integration into your applications.\n\n**in addition, the openvino-dev package installs the following components by default:**\n\n| component        | console script

see [troubleshooting guide for openvino installation](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.2/openvino_docs_get_started_guide_troubleshooting.html). the following sections also provide explanations to several error messages.\n\n### errors with installing via pip for users in china\n\nusers in china might encounter errors while downloading sources via pip during openvino\u2122 installation. to resolve the issues, try the following solution:\n\n* add the download source using the ``-i`` parameter with the python ``pip`` command. for example:\n\n   ``` sh\n   pip install openvino-dev -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/\n   ```\n   use the ``--trusted-host`` parameter if the url above is ``http`` instead of ``https``.\n   you can also run the following command to install openvino-dev with specific frameworks. for example:\n\n   ```\n   pip install openvino-dev[tensorflow2] -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/\n   ```\n\n### zsh: no matches found : openvino-dev[...]\n\nif you use zsh (z shell) interpreter, that is the default shell for macos starting with version 10.15 (catalina), you may encounter the following error while installing `openvino-dev` package with extras:\n\n```sh\npip install openvino-dev[tensorflow2,mxnet,caffe]\nzsh: no matches found: openvino-dev[tensorflow2,mxnet,caffe]\n```\n\nby default zsh interprets square brackets as an expression for pattern matching. to resolve this issue, you need to escape the command with quotes:\n\n```sh\npip install 'openvino-dev[tensorflow2,mxnet,caffe]'\n```\n\nto avoid such issues you can also disable globbing for pip commands by defining an alias in `~/.zshrc` file:\n\n```sh\nalias pip='noglob pip'\n```\n\n### error:root:could not find the inference engine or ngraph python api.\n\non windows*, some libraries are necessary to run openvino. to resolve this issue, install the [c++ redistributable (.exe)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). you can also view a full download list on the [official support page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).\n\n### importerror: libpython3.8.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory\n\nto resolve missing external dependency on ubuntu* 18.04, execute the following command:\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install libpython3.8\n```\n\n## additional
