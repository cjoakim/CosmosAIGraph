  "description": "genie - the pyats standard library\n==================================\n\ngenie is both a library framework and a test harness that facilitates rapid\ndevelopment, encourage re-usable and simplify writing test automation. genie bundled with\nthe modular architecture of pyats framework accelerates and simplifies test\nautomation leveraging all the perks of the python programming language in an\nobject-orienting fashion.\n\npyats is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and\nreusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for agile, rapid development\niterations. extensible by design, pyats enables developers start with small,\nsimple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous\ntest suites.\n\ngenie was initially developed internally in cisco, and is now available to the\ngeneral public starting early 2018 through `cisco devnet`_. visit the genie\nhome page at\n\n    https://developer.cisco.com/site/pyats/\n\n.. _cisco devnet: https://developer.cisco.com/\n\n\ncomponent breakdown\n-------------------\n\nconf\n    sub-component of genie that configures topology through python object\n    attributes, featuring a common object structure. these object's structures\n    means that they are compatible with all operating systems and management\n    interfaces (such as cli/yang/rest, etc.)\n\nops\n    sub-component of genie that represents the operational state of the\n    feature through object attributes. these object's structures means that\n    they are compatible with all operating systems and management interfaces\n    (such as cli/yang/rest, etc).\n\nharness\n    sub-component of genie which bring the concept of event driven\n    testing into the pyats framework. with event driven testing, script and\n    testcases are derived dynamically based on selected triggers and \n    verification from the genie sdk pool.\n\nutils\n    as its name suggests - various utilities used throughout the infrastructure.\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\ngenie currently supports python 3.4+ on linux & mac systems. \nwindows platforms are not yet supported.\n\nquick start\n-----------\n\n.. code-block:: console\n    \n    # install genie as a whole\n    $ pip install genie\n\n    # to upgrade this package manually\n    $ pip install --upgrade genie\n\n    # to install alpha/beta versions, add --pre\n    $ pip install --pre genie\n\n    \n\nfor more information on setting up your python development environment,\nsuch as creating virtual environment and installing ``pip`` on your system, \nplease refer to `virtual environment and packages`_ in python tutorials.\n\n.. _virtual environment and packages: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html\n\nexample\n-------\n\nexamples showcasing various features & idioms of coding can be found here:\n\thttps://github.com/ciscotestautomation/examples\n",
