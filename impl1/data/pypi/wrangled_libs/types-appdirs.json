  "description": "## typing stubs for appdirs\n\nthis is a pep 561 type stub package for the `appdirs` package. it\ncan be used by type-checking tools like\n[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),\n[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),\n[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),\npycharm, etc. to check code that uses\n`appdirs`. the source for this package can be found at\nhttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/appdirs. all fixes for\ntypes and metadata should be contributed there.\n\nthe `appdirs` package has been deprecated in favour of the `platformdirs` package, which ships with a `py.typed` file. users should migrate their `appdirs` code to use `platformdirs` instead, which will remove the need for the `types-appdirs` package.\n\n*note:* `types-appdirs` is unmaintained and won't be updated.\n\n\nsee https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/readme.md for more details.\nthis package was generated from typeshed commit `7e0b9b44dea0b170081cafd596c2804089dc2125`.\n",
