https://zopetraversing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n        :alt: documentation status\n\nthis package provides adapters for resolving object paths by traversing\nan object hierarchy.  this package also includes support for traversal\nnamespaces (e.g. ``++view++``, ``++skin++``, etc.) as well as computing\nurls via the ``@@absolute_url`` view.\n\ndocumentation is hosted at https://zopetraversing.readthedocs.io/\n\n\n=========\n changes\n=========\n\n5.0 (2023-03-27)\n================\n\n- drop support for python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\n- add support for python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11.\n\n\n4.4.1 (2020-03-31)\n==================\n\n- ensure all objects have consistent resolution orders. previously,\n  the \"debug\" namespace's \"errors\" flag completely changed the\n  resolution order of the request instead of simply adding the \"debug\" skin.\n\n\n4.4.0 (2020-03-30)\n==================\n\n- drop support for python 3.4.\n\n- add support for python 3.8.\n\n\n4.3.1 (2018-10-16)\n==================\n\n- fix deprecationwarnings for ``componentlookuperror`` by\n  importing them from ``zope.interface.interfaces``. see `issue 10\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.traversing/issues/10>`_.\n\n\n4.3 (2018-10-05)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.7.\n\n- host documentation at https://zopetraversing.readthedocs.io\n\n4.2.0 (2017-09-23)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.6.\n\n- drop support for python 3.3.\n\n- drop support for ``python setup.py test``.\n\n4.1.0 (2016-08-05)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.5.\n\n- drop support for python 2.6.\n\n- gracefully handle ``unicodeencodeerror`` that can be produced when\n  doing attribute lookup on python 2 by instead raising a ``locationerror``.\n\n4.0.0 (2014-03-21)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.4.\n\n\n4.0.0a3 (2013-03-12)\n====================\n\n- add support for pypy.\n\n\n4.0.0a2 (2013-02-21)\n====================\n\n- remove ``zope.container`` testing dependency to break another circular\n  dependency.\n\n- remove ``zope.pagetemplate`` testing dependency to break another circular\n  dependency.\n\n- remove ``zope.browserpage`` (zcml) dependency by using low-level directives.\n\n- remove ``zope.site`` testing dependency.\n\n\n4.0.0a1 (2013-02-20)\n====================\n\n- replace deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.\n\n- replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.\n\n- drop support for python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n- add support for python 3.3.\n\n- fix dependencies : removed ``zope.tal`` and added ``zope.browserpage``.\n\n\n3.14.0 (2011-03-02)\n===================\n\n- re-release of 3.13.1 as a feature version as it introduces dependencies on\n  new feature releases.\n\n3.13.1 (2010-12-14)\n===================\n\n- fix zcml-related dependencies.\n\n3.13 (2010-07-09)\n=================\n\n- when a ``__parent__`` attribute is available on an object, it is\n  always used for absolute url construction, and no ilocation adapter\n  lookup is performed for it. this was the previous behavior but was\n  broken (around 3.5?) due to dependency refactoring.\n\n  if the object provides no ``__parent__`` then an ilocation adapter\n  lookup will be performed. this will always succeed as zope.location\n  provides a default locationproxy for everything, but more specific\n  ilocation adapters can also be provided.\n\n3.12.1 (2010-04-30)\n===================\n\n- remove use of ``zope.testing.doctestunit`` in favor of stdlib's doctest.\n\n3.12.0 (2009-12-29)\n===================\n\n- avoid testing dependencies on ``zope.securitypolicies`` and\n  ``zope.principalregistry``.\n\n3.11.0 (2009-12-27)\n===================\n\n- remove testing dependency on ``zope.app.publication``.\n\n3.10.0 (2009-12-16)\n===================\n\n- remove stray test claiming a no longer existing dependency on\n  ``zope.app.applicationcontrol``.\n\n- refactor functional tests to loose dependency on both\n  ``zope.app.appsetup`` and ``zope.app.testing``.\n\n- simplify tests for the ``browser`` sub-package by using ``placelesssetup``\n  from ``zope.component.testing`` instead of ``zope.app.testing``.\n\n- simplify ``test_dependencies`` module by using ``zope.configuration``\n  instead of ``zope.app.testing.functional``.\n\n- remove testing dependency on ``zope.app.publisher``.\n\n- replace testing dependency on ``zope.app.security`` with\n  ``zope.securitypolicy``.\n\n- remove testing dependency on ``zope.app.zcmlfiles`` in favor of more\n  explicit dependencies.\n\n- remove testing dependency on ``zope.app.component``.\n\n- replace a test dependency on ``zope.app.zptpage`` with a dependency on\n  ``zope.pagetemplate``.\n\n3.9.0 (2009-12-15)\n==================\n\n- move ``ibeforetraverseevent`` here from ``zope.app.publication``,\n  as we already deal with publication traversal.\n\n3.8.0 (2009-09-29)\n==================\n\n- in ``zope.traversing.api.getparent()``, try to delegate to\n  ``zope.location.interfaces.ilocationinfo.getparent()``, analogous to\n  ``getparents()``. keep returning the traversal parent as a fallback.\n\n- bring ``itraverser`` back from ``zope.location`` where it had been moved\n  to invert the package interdependency, but where it is now no longer used.\n\n3.7.2 (2009-08-29)\n==================\n\n- make virtual hosting tests compatible with ``zope.publisher`` 3.9.\n  redirecting to a different host requires an explicit ``trusted``\n  redirect now.\n\n3.7.1 (2009-06-16)\n==================\n\n- ``absoluteurl`` now implements the fact that ``__call__`` returns the same\n  as ``__str__`` in a manner that it applies for subclasses, too, so they only\n  have to override ``__str__`` and not both.\n\n3.7.0 (2009-05-23)\n==================\n\n- move the ``publicationtraverse`` module to ``zope.traversing``, removing the\n  ``zope.app.publisher`` -> ``zope.app.publication`` dependency (which was a\n  cycle).\n\n- look up the application controller through a utility registration\n  rather than a direct reference.\n\n3.6.0 (2009-04-06)\n==================\n\n- change ``configure.zcml`` not to depend on ``zope.app.component``.\n\n- this release includes the bbb-incompatible ``zope.publisher.skinnable``\n  change from 3.5.3.\n\n3.5.4 (2009-04-06)\n==================\n\n- revert bbb-incompatible use of ``zope.publisher.skinnable``:  that\n  change belongs in a 3.6.0 release, because it requires a bbb-incompatible\n  version of ``zope.publisher``.\n\n3.5.3 (2009-03-10)\n==================\n\n- use applyskin from new location. zope.publisher.skinnable instead of\n  zope.publisher.browser.\n\n- use iabsoluteurl lookup instead of the \"absolute_url\" view in the\n  recursive absoluteurl adapters (lp: #338101).\n\n3.5.2 (2009-02-04)\n==================\n\n- ``rootphysicallylocatable`` is not the same as\n  ``locationphysicallylocatable`` (now in ``zope.location``).\n  fix the import and testing setups.\n\n3.5.1 (2009-02-02)\n==================\n\n- obsolete the ``rootphysicallylocatable`` adapter, which has been superseded\n  by the refactored ``zope.location.traversing.locationphysicallylocatable``\n  that we depend on since 3.5.0a4.\n\n  remove the adapter and its registration, and making its import place\n  pointing to ``zope.location.traversing.locationphysicallylocatable``\n  to maintain backward-compatibility.\n\n  this also fixes a bug introduced in version 3.5.0a4 when trying to\n  call ``getparents`` function for the root object.\n\n- use direct imports instead of compatibility ones for things that were\n  moved to ``zope.location``.\n\n- remove the ``zope.traversing.interfaces.inamespacehandler`` interface,\n  as it seems not to be used for years.\n\n- change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead\n  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org\n\n3.5.0 (2009-01-31)\n==================\n\n- use zope.container instead of ``zope.app.container``.\n\n- use zope.site instead of ``zope.app.folder`` in the unit tests.\n\n- reduce, but not eliminate, test dependencies on ``zope.app.component``.\n\n3.5.0a4 (2008-08-01)\n====================\n\n- reverse dependencies between ``zope.location`` and ``zope.traversing``.\n\n- update (test) dependencies and tests to expect and work with a spec\n  compliant tal interpreter as available in ``zope.tal`` >= 3.5.0.\n\n- fix deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for\n  ``zopesecuritypolicy`` in ``ftesting.zcml``.\n\n- ensure traversing doesn't raise an typeerror but a traversalerror when the\n  traversal step before yielded a string.\n\n\n3.5.0a3 (2007-12-28)\n====================\n\n- back out the controversial ``++skin++`` traverser for xml-rpc.\n\n\n3.5.0a2 (2007-11-28)\n====================\n\n- port 3.4.1a1 to trunk\n\n  - do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual\n    host namespace. this caused ``absolute_url`` to create unicode url's.\n\n- add a traverer for ``++skin++`` for xmlrpc skins (``ixmlrpcskintype``).\n  this also means that the normal ``++skin++`` namespace handler is only\n  bound to ``ibrowserrequest``.\n\n- resolve the dependency on ``zope.app.applicationcontrol`` by importing the\n  application controller only if the package is available.\n\n\n3.4.1 (2008-07-30)\n==================\n\n- fix deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for\n  ``zopesecuritypolicy`` in ``ftesting.zcml``.\n\n\n3.4.1a1 (2007-11-13)\n====================\n\n- do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual\n  host namespace. this caused absolute_url to create unicode url's.\n\n\n3.4.0 (2007-09-29)\n==================\n\nno further changes since 3.4.0a1.\n\n3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)\n====================\n\ninitial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.traversing``\nfrom zope 3.4.0a1\n",
