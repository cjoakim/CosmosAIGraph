https://zopelocation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\n=========\n changes\n=========\n\n5.0 (2023-05-25)\n================\n\n- drop support for python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\n\n4.3 (2022-11-29)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11.\n\n- drop support for python 3.4.\n\n\n4.2 (2018-10-09)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.7.\n\n\n4.1.0 (2017-08-03)\n==================\n\n- drop support for python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n- add a page to the docs on hacking ``zope.location``.\n\n- note additional documentation dependencies.\n\n- add support for python 3.5 and 3.6.\n\n- remove internal ``_compat`` implementation module.\n\n4.0.3 (2014-03-19)\n==================\n\n- add python 3.4 support.\n\n- update ``boostrap.py`` to version 2.2.\n\n\n4.0.2 (2013-03-11)\n==================\n\n- change the behavior of ``locationproxy``'s ``__setattr__()`` to correctly\n  behave when dealing with the pure python version of the ``proxybase``\n  class. also added a test suite that fully tests the pure python proxy\n  version of the ``locationproxy`` class.\n\n\n4.0.1 (2013-02-19)\n==================\n\n- add python 3.3 support.\n\n4.0.0 (2012-06-07)\n==================\n\n- remove backward-compatibility imports:\n\n  - ``zope.copy.clone`` (aliased as ``zope.location.pickling.locationcopy``)\n\n  - ``zope.copy.copypersistent`` (aliased as\n    ``zope.location.pickling.copypersistent``).\n\n  - ``zope.site.interfaces.ipossiblesite`` (aliased as\n    ``zope.location.interfaces.ipossiblesite``).\n\n- add python 3.2 support.\n\n- make ``zope.component`` dependency optional.  use the ``component`` extra\n  to force its installation (or just require it directly).  if\n  ``zope.component`` is not present, this package defines the ``isite``\n  interface itself, and omits adapter registrations from its zcml.\n\n- add support for pypy.\n\n- add support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.\n\n- bring unit test coverage to 100%.\n\n- add sphinx documentation:  moved doctest examples to api reference.\n\n- add 'setup.py docs' alias (installs ``sphinx`` and dependencies).\n\n- add 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs\n  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).\n\n- replace deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.\n\n- replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.\n\n- drop support for python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n\n3.9.1 (2011-08-22)\n==================\n\n- add zcml extra as well as a test for configure.zcml.\n\n\n3.9.0 (2009-12-29)\n==================\n\n- move locationcopyhook related tests to zope.copy and remove a test\n  dependency on that package.\n\n3.8.2 (2009-12-23)\n==================\n\n- fix a typo in the configure.zcml.\n\n3.8.1 (2009-12-23)\n==================\n\n- remove dependency on zope.copy: the locationcopyhook adapter is registered\n  only if zope.copy is available.\n\n- use the standard python doctest module instead of zope.testing.doctest, which\n  has been deprecated.\n\n3.8.0 (2009-12-22)\n==================\n\n- adjust to testing output caused by new zope.schema.\n\n3.7.1 (2009-11-18)\n==================\n\n- move the ipossiblesite and isite interfaces to zope.component as they are\n  dealing with zope.component's concept of a site, but not with location.\n\n3.7.0 (2009-09-29)\n==================\n\n- add getparent() to ilocationinfo and moved the actual implementation here\n  from zope.traversal.api, analogous to getparents().\n\n- actually remove deprecated pathpersistent class from\n  zope.location.pickling.\n\n- move itraverser back to zope.traversing where it belongs conceptually. the\n  interface had been moved to zope.location to invert the package\n  interdependency but is no longer used here.\n\n3.6.0 (2009-08-27)\n==================\n\n- new feature release: deprecate locationcopy, copypersistent and\n  pathpersistent from zope.location.pickling. these changes were already part\n  of the 3.5.3 release, which was erroneously numbered as a bugfix relese.\n\n- remove dependency on zope.deferredimport, directly import deprecated modules\n  without using it.\n\n3.5.5 (2009-08-15)\n==================\n\n- add zope.deferredimport as a dependency as it's used directly by\n  zope.location.pickling.\n\n3.5.4 (2009-05-17)\n==================\n\n- add ``icontained`` interface to ``zope.location.interfaces`` module.\n  this interface was moved from ``zope.container`` (after\n  ``zope.container`` 3.8.2); consumers of ``icontained`` may now\n  depend on zope.location rather than zope.container to reduce\n  dependency cycles.\n\n3.5.3 (2009-02-09)\n==================\n\n- use new zope.copy package for implementing location copying. thus\n  there's changes in the ``zope.locaton.pickling`` module:\n\n   * the ``locationcopy`` and ``copypersistent`` was removed in prefer\n     to their equivalents in zope.copy. deprecated backward-compatibility\n     imports provided.\n\n   * the module now provides a ``zope.copy.interfaces.icopyhook`` adapter\n     for ``ilocation`` objects that replaces the old copypersistent\n     functionality of checking for the need to clone objects based on\n     their location.\n\n3.5.2 (2009-02-04)\n==================\n\n- split rootphysicallylocatable adapter back from locationphysicallylocatable,\n  because the iroot object may not always provide ilocation and the code\n  for the root object is also simplier. it's basically a copy of the\n  rootphysicallylocatable adapter from zope.traversing version 3.5.0 and\n  below with ``getparents`` method added (returns an empty list).\n\n3.5.1 (2009-02-02)\n==================\n\n- improve test coverage.\n\n- the new ``getparents`` method was extracted from ``zope.traversing``\n  and added to ilocationinfo interface in the previous release. custom\n  ilocationinfo implementations should make sure they have this method\n  as well. that method is already used in ``zope.traversing.api.getparents``\n  function.\n\n- make ``getname`` of locationphysicallylocatable always return empty\n  string for the iroot object, like rootphysicallylocatable from\n  ``zope.traversing`` did. so, now locationphysicallylocatable is\n  fully compatible with rootphysicallylocatable, making the latter one\n  obsolete.\n\n- change package mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead\n  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org.\n\n3.5.0 (2009-01-31)\n==================\n\n- reverse the dependency between zope.location and zope.traversing. this\n  also causes the dependency to various other packages go away.\n\n3.4.0 (2007-10-02)\n==================\n\n- initial release independent of the main zope tree.\n",
