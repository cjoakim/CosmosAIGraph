  "description": "the **seeq** python module is used to interface with seeq server ([http://www.seeq.com](http://www.seeq.com)).\n\ndocumentation can be found at\n[https://python-docs.seeq.com](https://python-docs.seeq.com/).\n\n**important:**\n\nthis module mirrors the versioning of seeq server, such that the version of this module reflects the version\nof the seeq server from which the seeq sdk was generated.\n\nfor seeq server version r60 and later, the spy module\n[is in its own namespace package](https://pypi.org/project/seeq-spy/) called `seeq-spy` with its own versioning\nscheme. (prior to r60, the spy module was bundled into this main `seeq` module.)\n\n# upgrade considerations\n\n## when using seeq data lab:\n\nif you are using **seeq data lab**, you should not upgrade or otherwise affect the pre-installed version of the\n`seeq` module, as the pre-installed version correctly matches the version of seeq server that data lab is tied\nto.\n\n### older than r60\n\nhowever, in older versions of seeq server, you must follow the (more complex) instructions on the corresponding pypi\npages for that version:\n\nhttps://pypi.org/project/seeq/55.4.9.183.34/\nhttps://pypi.org/project/seeq/56.1.9.184.21/\nhttps://pypi.org/project/seeq/57.2.7.184.22/\nhttps://pypi.org/project/seeq/58.1.3.184.22/\nhttps://pypi.org/project/seeq/59.0.1.184.25/\n\n## when not using seeq data lab:\n\nif you are _not_ using **seeq data lab**, you should install the version of the `seeq` module that corresponds\nto the first two numbers in the version of seeq you are interfacing with. e.g.: `pip install -u seeq~=56.2`. you\nshould then upgrade spy separately via `pip install -u seeq-spy`.\n\n# seeq.spy\n\nthe spy module is the recommended programming interface for interacting with the seeq server.\nsee [https://pypi.org/project/seeq-spy/](https://pypi.org/project/seeq-spy/) for more information on the spy module.\n\nfor more advanced tasks than what the spy module can provide, you may with to use the sdk module described below.\n\n# seeq.sdk\n\nthe seeq **sdk** module is a set of python bindings for the seeq server rest api. you can experiment with the rest api\nby selecting the *api reference* menu item in the upper-right \"hamburger\" menu of seeq workbench.\n\n**the sdk module supports both python 2.x and python 3.x, but it is strongly recommended that you use python 3.x\n(or later) as python 2.x is end-of-life.**\n\nlogin is accomplished with the following pattern:\n\n```\nimport seeq\nimport getpass\n\napi_client = seeq.sdk.apiclient('http://localhost:34216/api')\n\n# change this to false if you're getting errors related to ssl\nseeq.sdk.configuration().verify_ssl = true\n\nauth_api = seeq.sdk.authapi(api_client)\nauth_input = seeq.sdk.authinputv1()\n\n# use raw_input() instead of input() if you're using python 2\nauth_input.username = input('username:').rstrip().lower()\nauth_input.password = getpass.getpass()\nauth_input.auth_provider_class = \"auth\"\nauth_input.auth_provider_id = \"seeq\"\nauth_api.login(body=auth_input)\n```\n\nthe `api_client` object is then used as the argument to construct any api object you need, such as\n`seeq.sdk.itemsapi`. each of the root endpoints that you see in the *api reference* webpage corresponds to\na `seeq.sdk.xxxxxapi` class.\n\n----------\n\nin case you are looking for the gencove package, it is available here: https://pypi.org/project/gencove/\n",
