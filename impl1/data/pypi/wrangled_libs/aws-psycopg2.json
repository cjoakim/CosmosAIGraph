  "description": "psycopg2 python library for aws lambda\n======================================\n\nthis is a custom compiled psycopg2 c library for python. due to aws lambda\nmissing the required postgresql libraries in the ami image, we needed to\ncompile psycopg2 with the postgresql `libpq.so` library statically linked\nlibpq library instead of the default dynamic link.\n\n\n### install and setup\n\n``` pip install aws-psycopg2 ```\n\n### source code : https://github.com/abhimanyuhk/aws-psycopg2 \n\n### instructions on compiling this package from scratch\n\nhere was the process that was used to build this package. you will need to\nperform these steps if you want to build a newer version of the psycopg2\nlibrary.\n\n1. download the\n  [postgresql source code](https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v9.4.3/postgresql-9.4.3.tar.gz) and extract into a directory.\n2. download the\n  [psycopg2 source code](http://initd.org/psycopg/tarballs/psycopg-2-6/psycopg2-2.6.1.tar.gz) and extract into a directory.\n3. go into the postgresql source directory and execute the following commands:\n  - `./configure --prefix {path_to_postgresql_source} --without-readline --without-zlib`\n  - `make`\n  - `make install`\n4. go into the psycopg2 source directory and edit the `setup.cfg` file with the following:\n  - `pg_config={path_to_postgresql_source/bin/pg_config}`\n  - `static_libpq=1`\n5. execute `python setup.py build` in the psycopg2 source directory.\n\nafter the above steps have been completed you will then have a build directory\nand the custom compiled psycopg2 library will be contained within it. copy this\ndirectory into your aws lambda package and you will now be able to access\npostgresql from within aws lambda using the psycopg2 library.\n\n\n",
