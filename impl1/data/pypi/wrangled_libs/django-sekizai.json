  "description": "==============\ndjango sekizai\n==============\n\n|pypi| |build| |coverage|\n\nsekizai means \"blocks\" in japanese, and that's what this app provides. a fresh\nlook at blocks. with django-sekizai you can define placeholders where your\nblocks get rendered and at different places in your templates append to those\nblocks. this is especially useful for css and javascript. your sub-templates can\nnow define css and javascript files to be included, and the css will be nicely\nput at the top and the javascript to the bottom, just like you should. also\nsekizai will ignore any duplicate content in a single block.\n\nthere are some issue/restrictions with this implementation due to how the\ndjango template language works, but if used properly it can be very useful and\nit is the media handling framework for the django cms (since version 2.2).\n\n.. note:: \n        \n        this project is endorsed by the `django cms association <https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/>`_.\n        that means that it is officially accepted by the dca as being in line with our roadmap vision and development/plugin policy. \n        join us on `slack <https://www.django-cms.org/slack/>`_.\n\n\n*******************************************\ncontribute to this project and win rewards\n*******************************************\n\nbecause this is a an open-source project, we welcome everyone to\n`get involved in the project <https://www.django-cms.org/en/contribute/>`_ and\n`receive a reward <https://www.django-cms.org/en/bounty-program/>`_ for their contribution. \nbecome part of a fantastic community and help us make django cms the best cms in the world.   \n\nwe'll be delighted to receive your\nfeedback in the form of issues and pull requests. before submitting your\npull request, please review our `contribution guidelines\n<http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html>`_.\n\nwe're grateful to all contributors who have helped create and maintain this package.\ncontributors are listed at the `contributors <https://github.com/django-cms/django-sekizai/graphs/contributors>`_\nsection.\n\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\nsee ``requirements`` in the `setup.py <https://github.com/divio/django-sekizai/blob/master/setup.py>`_\nfile for additional dependencies:\n\n|python| |django|\n\nplease refer to the documentation in the docs/ directory for more information or visit our\n`online documentation <https://django-sekizai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\n\nrunning tests\n-------------\n\nyou can run tests by executing::\n\n    virtualenv env\n    source env/bin/activate\n    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt\n    python setup.py test\n\n\n.. |pypi| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/django-sekizai.svg\n    :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/django-sekizai\n.. |build| image:: https://travis-ci.org/divio/django-sekizai.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/divio/django-sekizai\n.. |coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/divio/django-sekizai/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/divio/django-sekizai\n\n.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.5+-blue.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/django-sekizai/\n.. |django| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/django-2.2,%203.0,%203.1-blue.svg\n    :target: https://www.djangoproject.com/\n",
