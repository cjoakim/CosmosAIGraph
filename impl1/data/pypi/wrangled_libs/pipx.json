<https://github.com/pypa/pipx>\n\n_for comparison to other tools including pipsi, see\n[comparison to other tools](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/comparisons/)._\n\n## install pipx\n\n> [!note] it is not recommended to install `pipx` via `pipx`. if you'd like to do this anyway, take a look at the\n> [`pipx-in-pipx`](https://github.com/mattsb42-meta/pipx-in-pipx) project and read about the limitations there.\n\n### on macos\n\n```\nbrew install pipx\npipx ensurepath\n```\n\nupgrade pipx with `brew update && brew upgrade pipx`.\n\n### on linux\n\n- ubuntu 23.04 or above\n\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install pipx\npipx ensurepath\n```\n\n- ubuntu 22.04 or below\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install --user pipx\npython3 -m pipx ensurepath\n```\n\nupgrade pipx with `python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pipx`.\n\n### on windows, install via pip (requires pip 19.0 or later)\n\n```\n# if you installed python using microsoft store, replace `py` with `python3` in the next line.\npy -m pip install --user pipx\n```\n\nit is possible (even most likely) the above finishes with a warning looking similar to this:\n\n```\nwarning: the script pipx.exe is installed in `<user folder>\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python3x\\scripts` which is not on path\n```\n\nif so, go to the mentioned folder, allowing you to run the pipx executable directly. enter the following line (even if\nyou did not get the warning):\n\n```\n.\\pipx.exe ensurepath\n```\n\nthis will add both the above mentioned path and the `%userprofile%\\.local\\bin` folder to your search path. restart your\nterminal session and verify `pipx` does run.\n\nupgrade pipx with `py -m pip install --user --upgrade pipx`.\n\n### using pipx without installing (via zipapp)\n\nyou can also use pipx without installing it. the zipapp can be downloaded from\n[github releases](https://github.com/pypa/pipx/releases) and you can invoke it with a python 3.7+ interpreter:\n\n```\npython pipx.pyz ensurepath\n```\n\n### use with pre-commit\n\npipx [has pre-commit support](installation.md#pre-commit).\n\n### shell completions\n\nshell completions are available by following the instructions printed with this command:\n\n```\npipx completions\n```\n\nfor more details, see the [installation instructions](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).\n\n## overview: what is `pipx`?\n\npipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in python. it's roughly similar to macos's\n`brew`, javascript's [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b), and\nlinux's `apt`.\n\nit's closely related to pip. in fact, it uses pip, but is focused on installing and managing python packages that can be\nrun from the command line directly as applications.\n\n### how is it different from pip?\n\npip is a general-purpose package installer for both libraries and apps with no environment isolation. pipx is made\nspecifically for application installation, as it adds isolation yet still makes the apps available in your shell: pipx\ncreates an isolated environment for each application and its associated packages.\n\npipx does not ship with pip, but installing it is often an important part of bootstrapping your system.\n\n### where does `pipx` install apps from?\n\nby default, pipx uses the same package index as pip, [pypi](https://pypi.org/). pipx can also install from all other\nsources pip can, such as a local directory, wheel, git url, etc.\n\npython and pypi allow developers to distribute code with \"console script entry points\". these entry points let users\ncall into python code from the command line, effectively acting like standalone applications.\n\npipx is a tool to install and run any of these thousands of application-containing packages in a safe, convenient, and\nreliable way. **in a way, it turns python package index (pypi) into a big app store for python applications.** not all\npython packages have entry points, but many do.\n\nif you would like to make your package compatible with pipx, all you need to do is add a\n[console scripts](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html#the-console-scripts-entry-point)\nentry point. if you're a poetry user, use [these instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#scripts). or\nyou're using hatch, [try this](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/metadata/#cli).\n\n## features\n\n`pipx` enables you to\n\n- expose cli entrypoints of packages (\"apps\") installed to isolated environments with the `install` command. this\n  guarantees no dependency conflicts and clean uninstalls!\n- easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages that were installed with pipx\n- run the latest version of a python application in a temporary environment with the `run` command\n\nbest of all, pipx runs with regular user permissions, never calling `sudo pip install` (you aren't doing that, are you?\n\ud83d\ude04).\n\n### walkthrough: installing a package and its applications with `pipx`\n\nyou can globally install an application by running\n\n```\npipx install package\n```\n\nthis automatically creates a virtual environment, installs the package, and adds the package's associated applications\n(entry points) to a location on your `path`. for example, `pipx install pycowsay` makes the `pycowsay` command available\nglobally, but sandboxes the pycowsay package in its own virtual environment. **pipx never needs to run as sudo to do\nthis.**\n\nexample:\n\n```\n>> pipx install pycowsay\n  installed package pycowsay 2.0.3, python 3.7.3\n  these apps are now globally available\n    - pycowsay\ndone! \u2728 \ud83c\udf1f \u2728\n\n\n>> pipx list\nvenvs are in /home/user/.local/share/pipx/venvs\napps are exposed on your $path at /home/user/.local/bin\n   package pycowsay 2.0.3, python 3.7.3\n    - pycowsay\n\n\n# now you can run pycowsay from anywhere\n>> pycowsay mooo\n  ____\n< mooo >\n  ====\n         \\\n          \\\n            ^__^\n            (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n\n```\n\n### installing from source control\n\nyou can also install from a git repository. here, `black` is used as an example.\n\n```\npipx install git+https://github.com/psf/black.git\npipx install git+https://github.com/psf/black.git@branch  # branch of your choice\npipx install git+https://github.com/psf/black.git@ce14fa8b497bae2b50ec48b3bd7022573a59cdb1  # git hash\npipx install https://github.com/psf/black/archive/18.9b0.zip  # install a release\n```\n\nthe pip syntax with `egg` must be used when installing extras:\n\n```\npipx install \"git+https://github.com/psf/black.git#egg=black[jupyter]\"\n```\n\n### walkthrough: running an application in a temporary virtual environment\n\nthis is an alternative to `pipx install`.\n\n`pipx run` downloads and runs the above mentioned python \"apps\" in a one-time, temporary environment, leaving your\nsystem untouched afterwards.\n\nthis can be handy when you need to run the latest version of an app, but don't necessarily want it installed on your\ncomputer.\n\nyou may want to do this when you are initializing a new project and want to set up the right directory structure, when\nyou want to view the help text of an application, or if you simply want to run an app in a one-off case and leave your\nsystem untouched afterwards.\n\nfor example, the blog post [how to set up a perfect python project](https://sourcery.ai/blog/python-best-practices/)\nuses `pipx run` to kickstart a new project with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), a tool\nthat creates projects from project templates.\n\na nice side benefit is that you don't have to remember to upgrade the app since `pipx run` will automatically run a\nrecent version for you.\n\nokay, let's see what this looks like in practice!\n\n```\npipx run app [args...]\n```\n\nthis will install the package in an isolated, temporary directory and invoke the app. give it a try:\n\n```\n> pipx run pycowsay moo\n\n  ---\n< moo >\n  ---\n   \\   ^__^\n    \\  (oo)\\_______\n       (__)\\       )\\/\\\n           ||----w |\n           ||     ||\n\n\n```\n\nnotice that you **don't need to execute any install commands to run the app**.\n\nany arguments after the application name will be passed directly to the application:\n\n```\n> pipx run pycowsay these arguments are all passed to pycowsay!\n\n  -------------------------------------------\n< these arguments are all passed to pycowsay! >\n  -------------------------------------------\n   \\   ^__^\n    \\  (oo)\\_______\n       (__)\\       )\\/\\\n           ||----w |\n           ||     ||\n\n```\n\n### ambiguous arguments\n\nsometimes pipx can consume arguments provided for the application:\n\n```\n> pipx run pycowsay --py\n\nusage: pipx run [-h] [--no-cache] [--pypackages] [--spec spec] [--verbose] [--python python]\n                [--system-site-packages] [--index-url index_url] [--editable] [--pip-args pip_args]\n                app ...\npipx run: error: ambiguous option: --py could match --pypackages, --python\n```\n\nto prevent this put double dash `--` before app. it will make pipx to forward the arguments to the right verbatim to the\napplication:\n\n```\n> pipx run -- pycowsay --py\n\n\n  ----\n< --py >\n  ----\n   \\   ^__^\n    \\  (oo)\\_______\n       (__)\\       )\\/\\\n           ||----w |\n           ||     ||\n\n\n```\n\nre-running the same app is quick because pipx caches virtual environments on a per-app basis. the caches only last a few\ndays, and when they expire, pipx will again use the latest version of the package. this way you can be sure you're\nalways running a new version of the package without having to manually upgrade.\n\n### package with multiple apps, or the app name doesn't match the package name\n\nif the app name does not match the package name, you can use the `--spec` argument to specify the `package` name, and\nprovide the `app` to run separately:\n\n```\npipx run --spec package app\n```\n\nfor example, the [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) package doesn't provide an executable with the same\nname:\n\n```\n>> pipx run esptool\n'esptool' executable script not found in package 'esptool'.\navailable executable scripts:\n    esp_rfc2217_server.py - usage: 'pipx run --spec esptool esp_rfc2217_server.py [arguments?]'\n    espefuse.py - usage: 'pipx run --spec esptool espefuse.py [arguments?]'\n    espsecure.py - usage: 'pipx run --spec esptool espsecure.py [arguments?]'\n    esptool.py - usage: 'pipx run --spec esptool esptool.py [arguments?]'\n```\n\nyou can instead run the executables that this package provides by using `--spec`:\n\n```\npipx run --spec esptool esp_rfc2217_server.py\npipx run --spec esptool espefuse.py\npipx run --spec esptool espsecure.py\npipx run --spec esptool esptool.py\n```\n\nnote that the `.py` extension is not something you append to the executable name. it is part of the executable name, as\nprovided by the package. this can be anything. for example, when working with the\n[pymodbus](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus) package:\n\n```\n>> pipx run pymodbus[repl]\n'pymodbus' executable script not found in package 'pymodbus'.\navailable executable scripts:\n    pymodbus.console - usage: 'pipx run --spec pymodbus pymodbus.console [arguments?]'\n    pymodbus.server - usage: 'pipx run --spec pymodbus pymodbus.server [arguments?]'\n    pymodbus.simulator - usage: 'pipx run --spec pymodbus pymodbus.simulator [arguments?]'\n```\n\nyou can run the executables like this:\n\n```\npipx run --spec pymodbus[repl] pymodbus.console\npipx run --spec pymodbus[repl] pymodbus.server\npipx run --spec pymodbus[repl] pymodbus.simulator\n```\n\n### running a specific version of a package\n\nthe `package` argument above is actually a\n[requirement specifier](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-requirement-specifier). therefore, you can\nalso specify specific versions, version ranges, or extras. for example:\n\n```\npipx run mpremote==1.20.0\npipx run --spec esptool==4.6.2 esptool.py\npipx run --spec 'esptool>=4.5' esptool.py\npipx run --spec 'esptool >= 4.5' esptool.py\n```\n\nnotice that some requirement specifiers have to be enclosed in quotes or escaped.\n\n### running from source control\n\nyou can also run from a git repository. here, `black` is used as an example.\n\n```\npipx run --spec git+https://github.com/psf/black.git black\npipx run --spec git+https://github.com/psf/black.git@branch black  # branch of your choice\npipx run --spec git+https://github.com/psf/black.git@ce14fa8b497bae2b50ec48b3bd7022573a59cdb1 black  # git hash\npipx run --spec https://github.com/psf/black/archive/18.9b0.zip black # install a release\n```\n\n### running from url\n\nyou can run .py files directly, too.\n\n```\npipx run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cs01/fa721a17a326e551ede048c5088f9e0f/raw/6bdfbb6e9c1132b1c38fdd2f195d4a24c540c324/pipx-demo.py\npipx is working!\n```\n\n### summary\n\nthat's it! those are the most important commands `pipx` offers. to see all of pipx's documentation, run `pipx --help` or\nsee the [docs](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/).\n\n## testimonials\n\n<div>\n\"thanks for improving
