  "description": "## python-can-canine\n\n\n\nthis module is a plugin that lets you use [canine adapters](https://tinymovr.com/products/can-bus-adapter) with the [canine firmware](https://github.com/tinymovr/canine) in python-can.\n\n\n### installation\n\ninstall using pip:\n\n    $ pip install python-can-canine\n\n\n### usage\n\noverall, using this plugin is quite similar to the main python-can library, with the interface named `canine`. to integrate the canine interface into your scripts, you can import constants, device designations, and more from the python-can-canine module using `import canine`. for most scenarios, incorporating a canine interface is as easy as modifying python-can examples with the lines provided below:\n\ncreate python-can bus with the canine usb interface:\n\n    import can\n    from canine import caninebus\n\n    bus = can.bus(interface=\"canine\", bitrate=1000000)\n\n\n",
