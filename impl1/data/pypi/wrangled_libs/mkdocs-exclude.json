  "description": "# file exclude plugin for mkdocs\n\n`mkdocs-exclude` is a\n[mkdocs plugin](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/) that allows you\nto exclude files from your input using unix-style wildcards (globs) or\nregular expressions (regexes).\n\nthis implements what people were asking for in some mkdocs bugs, such as\n<https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1500> and\n<https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1152>.\n\n\n## quick start\n\n1. install the module using pip: `pip3 install mkdocs-exclude`\n\n2. in your project, add a plugin configuration to `mkdocs.yml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   plugins:\n     - exclude:\n         glob:\n           - exclude/this/path/*\n           - \"*.tmp\"\n           - \"*.pdf\"\n           - \"*.gz\"\n         regex:\n           - '.*\\.(tmp|bin|tar)$'\n   ```\n\nyou can provide zero or more patterns of each type.  (if you don't provide\nany patterns, then nothing will happen!)\n\nnote!  because of peculiarity of yaml syntax, the `glob:` and `regex:` lines\n**must not** start with a dash, but the lines under them **must** start with\na dash.\n\nalso because of yaml, patterns that start with a punctuation mark must be\nquoted.\n\nwhen writing regexes, it's best to use single quotes rather than double\nquotes, so that your regex backslash escapes are preserved correctly without\nhaving to be doubled up.",
