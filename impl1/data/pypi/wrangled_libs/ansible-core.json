certification](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2372/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2372)\n\n# ansible\n\nansible is a radically simple it automation system. it handles\nconfiguration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning,\nad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. ansible makes complex\nchanges like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. more information on the ansible [website](https://ansible.com/).\n\n## design principles\n\n* have an extremely simple setup process with a minimal learning curve.\n* manage machines quickly and in parallel.\n* avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by\n  leveraging the existing ssh daemon.\n* describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human\n  friendly.\n* focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.\n* manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any\n  software.\n* allow module development in any dynamic language, not just python.\n* be usable as non-root.\n* be the easiest it automation system to use, ever.\n\n## use ansible\n\nyou can install a released version of ansible with `pip` or a package manager. see our\n[installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for details on installing ansible\non a variety of platforms.\n\npower users and developers can run the `devel` branch, which has the latest\nfeatures and fixes, directly. although it is reasonably stable, you are more likely to encounter\nbreaking changes when running the `devel` branch. we recommend getting involved\nin the ansible community if you want to run the `devel` branch.\n\n## get involved\n\n* read [community information](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community) for all\n  kinds of ways to contribute to and interact with the project,\n  including mailing list information and how to submit bug reports and\n  code to ansible.\n* join a [working group](https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki),\n  an organized community devoted to a specific technology domain or platform.\n* submit a proposed code update through a pull request to the `devel` branch.\n* talk to us before making larger changes\n  to avoid duplicate efforts. this not only helps everyone\n  know what is going on, but it also helps save time and effort if we decide\n  some changes are needed.\n* for a list of email lists, irc channels and working groups, see the\n  [communication page](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html)\n\n## coding guidelines\n\nwe document our coding guidelines in the [developer guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/). we particularly suggest you review:\n\n* [contributing your module to ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_checklist.html)\n* [conventions, tips, and pitfalls](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_best_practices.html)\n\n## branch info\n\n* the `devel` branch corresponds to the release actively under development.\n* the `stable-2.x` branches correspond to stable releases.\n* create a branch based on `devel` and set up a [dev environment](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_general.html#common-environment-setup) if you want to open a pr.\n* see the [ansible release and maintenance](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html) page for information about active branches.\n\n## roadmap\n\nbased on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published for a major or minor version (ex: 2.7, 2.8).\nthe [ansible roadmap page](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/) details what is planned and how to influence the roadmap.\n\n## authors\n\nansible was created by [michael dehaan](https://github.com/mpdehaan)\nand has contributions from over 5000 users (and growing). thanks everyone!\n\n[ansible](https://www.ansible.com) is sponsored by [red hat, inc.](https://www.redhat.com)\n\n## license\n\ngnu general public license v3.0 or later\n\nsee [copying](copying) to see the
