  "description": "\n===========\ndjango-nose\n===========\n\n\n**django-nose** provides all the goodness of `nose`_ in your django tests, like:\n\n* testing just your apps by default, not all the standard ones that happen to\n  be in ``installed_apps``\n* running the tests in one or more specific modules (or apps, or classes, or\n  folders, or just running a specific test)\n* obviating the need to import all your tests into ``tests/__init__.py``.\n  this not only saves busy-work but also eliminates the possibility of\n  accidentally shadowing test classes.\n* taking advantage of all the useful `nose plugins`_\n\n.. _nose: https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _nose plugins: http://nose-plugins.jottit.com/\n\nit also provides:\n\n* fixture bundling, an optional feature which speeds up your fixture-based\n  tests by a factor of 4\n* reuse of previously created test dbs, cutting 10 seconds off startup time\n* hygienic transactiontestcases, which can save you a db flush per test\n* support for various databases. tested with mysql, postgresql, and sqlite.\n  others should work as well.\n\ndjango-nose requires nose 1.2.1 or later, and the `latest release`_ is\nrecommended.  it follows the `django's support policy`_, supporting:\n\n* django 1.8 (lts) with python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5\n* django 1.9 with python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5\n* django 1.10 with python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5\n* django 1.11 (lts) with python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6\n* django 2.0 with python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7\n* django 2.1 with python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7\n* django 2.2 with python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7\n\n.. _latest release: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose\n.. _django's support policy: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/internals/release-process/#supported-versions\n\n\nnote to users\n-------------\n\n`nose`_ has been in maintenance mode since at least 2015. ``django-nose`` is in\nmaintenance mode as well, and the sole maintainer is no longer an active user.\nsee `jazzband.co`_ to learn how ``django-nose`` is maintained and how you can\nhelp. new projects should consider using `pytest`_, or `unittest`_ with the\n`django testing framework`_.\n\n.. _jazzband.co: https://jazzband.co\n.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/\n.. _unittest: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html\n.. _django testing framework: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nyou can get django-nose from pypi with... :\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install django-nose\n\nthe development version can be installed with... :\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install -e git://github.com/jazzband/django-nose.git#egg=django-nose\n\nsince django-nose extends django's built-in test command, you should add it to\nyour ``installed_apps`` in ``settings.py``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    installed_apps = (\n        ...\n        'django_nose',\n        ...\n    )\n\nthen set ``test_runner`` in ``settings.py``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    test_runner = 'django_nose.nosetestsuiterunner'\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n:code:   https://github.com/jazzband/django-nose\n:issues: https://github.com/jazzband/django-nose/issues?state=open\n:docs:   https://django-nose.readthedocs.io\n\n\nchangelog\n---------\n\n1.4.7 (2020-08-19)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* document django 2.2 support, no changes needed\n* move project to `jazzband.co <https://jazzband.co>`_\n* fix fixture loading on mysql\n  (`issue 307 <https://github.com/jazzband/django-nose/issues/307>`_,\n  `dlareau <https://github.com/dlareau>`_)\n\n1.4.6 (2018-10-03)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* document django 2.0 and 2.1 support, no changes needed\n* document python 3.7 support\n\n1.4.5 (2017-08-22)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* add django 1.11 support\n\n1.4.4 (2016-06-27)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* add django 1.10 support\n* drop django 1.4 - 1.7, and python 2.6 support\n* drop south support\n\n1.4.3 (2015-12-28)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* add django 1.9 support\n* support long options without equals signs, such as \"--attr selected\"\n* support nose plugins using callback options\n* support nose options without default values (jsatt)\n* remove django from install dependencies, to avoid accidental upgrades\n  (jsocol, willkg)\n* setting reuse_db to an empty value now disables reuse_db, instead of\n  enabling it (wdoekes)\n\n1.4.2 (2015-10-07)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* warn against using reuse_db=1 and fastfixturetestcase in docs\n* reuse_db=1 uses new transaction management in django 1.7, 1.8 (scottsexton)\n* try to avoid accidentally using production database with reuse_db=1 (alexjg, eroninjapan)\n* supported django versions limited to current supported django version 1.4,\n  1.7, and 1.8, as well as relevant python versions.\n\n1.4.1 (2015-06-29)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* fix version number (ezarowny)\n* fix choice options, unbreaking nose-cover (aamirtharaj-rpx, jwhitlock)\n* support 1.8 app loading system (dgladkov)\n* support non-ascii file names (singingwolfboy)\n* better pep8'd assertion names (roganov)\n\n1.4 (2015-04-23)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* django 1.8 support (timc3, adepue, jwhitlock)\n* support --testrunner option (st4lk)\n* fix reuse_db second run in py3k (edrmp)\n\n1.3 (2014-12-05)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* django 1.6 and 1.7 support (conrado, co3k, nepherhotep, mbertheau)\n* python 3.3 and 3.4 testing and support (frewsxcv, jsocol)\n\n1.2 (2013-07-23)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* python 3 support (melinath and jonashaag)\n* django 1.5 compat (fabiosantoscode)\n\n1.1 (2012-05-19)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* django transactiontestcases don't clean up after themselves; they leave\n  junk in the db and clean it up only on ``_pre_setup``. thus, django makes\n  sure these tests run last. now django-nose does, too. this means one fewer\n  source of failures on existing projects. (erik rose)\n* add support for hygienic transactiontestcases. (erik rose)\n* support models that are used only for tests. just put them in any file\n  imported in the course of loading tests. no more crazy hacks necessary.\n  (erik rose)\n* make the fixture bundler more conservative, fixing some conceivable\n  situations in which fixtures would not appear as intended if a\n  transactiontestcase found its way into the middle of a bundle. (erik rose)\n* fix an error that would surface when using sqlalchemy with connection\n  pooling. (roger hu)\n* gracefully ignore the new ``--liveserver`` option introduced in django 1.4;\n  don't let it through to nose. (adam depue)\n\n1.0 (2012-03-12)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* new fixture-bundling plugin for avoiding needless fixture setup (erik rose)\n* moved fastfixturetestcase in from test-utils, so now all the\n  fixture-bundling stuff is in one library. (erik rose)\n* added the reuse_db setting for faster startup and shutdown. (erik rose)\n* fixed a crash when printing options with certain verbosities. (daniel abel)\n* broke hard dependency on mysql. support postgresql. (roger hu)\n* support sqlite, both memory- and disk-based. (roger hu and erik rose)\n* nail down versions of the package requirements. (daniel mizyrycki)\n\n\n\n_(older changes can be found in the full documentation)._\n\n\n",
