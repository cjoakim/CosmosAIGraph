  "description": "# clang-format python distribution\n\n[![pypi release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/clang-format.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/clang-format)\n\nthis project packages the `clang-format` utility as a python package. it allows you to install `clang-format` directly from pypi:\n\n```\npython -m pip install clang-format\n```\n\nthis projects intends to release a new pypi package for each major and minor release of `clang-format`.\n\n## use with pipx\n\nyou can use `pipx` to run clang-format, as well. for example, `pipx run clang-format <args>` will run clang-format without any previous install required on any machine with pipx (including all default github actions / azure runners, avoiding requiring a pre-install step or even `actions/setup-python`).\n\n## use from pre-commit\n\na [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hook is also [provided](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format), use like this:\n\n```yaml\n- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format\n  rev: v17.0.6\n  hooks:\n  - id: clang-format\n    types_or: [c++, c, cuda]\n```\n\nin contrast to many other pre-commit hooks, the versioning of the hook matches the versioning of `clang-format`.\n\nif you are required to stick with a given major/minor version of `clang-format` with your pre-commit-hook, you can use [this alternative hook repository](https://github.com/ssciwr/clang-format-hook) that also receives backports of older versions of clang-format.\ncurrently, all major/minor versions of llvm >= 10 are supported.\nit is best to subscribe to releases of the hook repository to get notified of new backport releases, as `pre-commit`'s auto-upgrade functionality will not work in that case.\n\n## building new releases\n\nthe [clang-format-wheel repository](https://github.com/ssciwr/clang-format-wheel) provides the logic to build and publish binary wheels of the `clang-format` utility.\n\nin order to add a new release, the following steps are necessary:\n\n* edit the [version file](https://github.com/ssciwr/clang-format-wheel/blob/main/clang-format_version.cmake) to reflect the new version.\n* make a github release to trigger the [github actions release workflow](https://github.com/ssciwr/clang-format-wheel/actions/workflows/release.yml). alternatively, the workflow can be triggered manually.\n\non manual triggers, the following input variables are available:\n* `use_qemu`: whether to build targets that require emulation (default: `true`)\n* `llvm_version`: override the llvm version (default: `\"\"`)\n* `wheel_version`: override the wheel packaging version (default `\"0\"`)\n* `deploy_to_testpypi`: whether to deploy to testpypi instead of pypi (default: `false`)\n\nthe repository with the precommit hook is automatically updated using a scheduled github actions workflow.\n\n## acknowledgements\n\nthis repository extends the great work of several other projects:\n\n* `clang-format` itself is [provided by the llvm project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) under the apache 2.0 license with llvm exceptions.\n* the build logic is based on [scikit-build](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build) which greatly reduces the amount of low level code necessary to package `clang-format`.\n* the `scikit-build` packaging examples of [cmake](https://github.com/scikit-build/cmake-python-distributions) and [ninja](https://github.com/scikit-build/ninja-python-distributions) were very helpful in packaging `clang-format`.\n* the ci build process is controlled by [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel) which makes building wheels across a number of platforms a pleasant experience (!)\n\nspecial thanks goes to mgevaert who initiated this project and maintained it until 2021.\n\nwe are grateful for the generous provisioning with ci resources that github currently offers to open source projects.\n",
