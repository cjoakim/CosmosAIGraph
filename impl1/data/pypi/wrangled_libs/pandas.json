easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    `nan`, `na`, or `nat`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n  - size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from dataframe and higher dimensional\n    objects\n  - automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    ignore the labels and let `series`, `dataframe`, etc. automatically\n    align the data for you in computations\n  - powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    and transforming data\n  - make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    differently-indexed data in other python and numpy data structures\n    into dataframe objects\n  - intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    large data sets\n  - intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    sets\n  - flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    data sets\n  - [**hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    labels per tick)\n  - robust io tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    (csv and delimited), [**excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**hdf5 format**][hdfstore]\n  - [**time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    date shifting and lagging\n\n\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n\n## where to get it\nthe source code is currently hosted on github at:\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n\nbinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [python\npackage index (pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\n```sh\n# conda\nconda install -c conda-forge pandas\n```\n\n```sh\n# or pypi\npip install pandas\n```\n\nthe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\n[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html). for full\ndetails, see the commit logs at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas.\n\n## dependencies\n- [numpy - adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays](https://www.numpy.org)\n- [python-dateutil - provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)\n- [pytz -
