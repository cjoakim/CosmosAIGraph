  "description": "a drop-in replacement for the re module.\n\nit uses re2 under the hood, of course, so various pcre features\n(e.g. backreferences, look-around assertions) are not supported.\nsee https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/syntax for the canonical\nreference, but known syntactic \"gotchas\" relative to python are:\n\n  * pcre supports \\z and \\z; re2 supports \\z; python supports \\z,\n    but calls it \\z. you must rewrite \\z to \\z in pattern strings.\n\nknown differences between this module's api and the re module's api:\n\n  * the error class does not provide any error information as attributes.\n  * the options class replaces the re module's flags with re2's options as\n    gettable/settable properties. please see re2.h for their documentation.\n  * the pattern string and the input string do not have to be the same type.\n    any str will be encoded to utf-8.\n  * the pattern string cannot be str if the options specify latin-1 encoding.\n\nknown issues with regard to building the c++ extension:\n\n  * building requires re2 to be installed on your system.\n    on debian, for example, install the libre2-dev package.\n  * building requires pybind11 to be installed on your system or venv.\n    on debian, for example, install the pybind11-dev package.\n    for a venv, install the pybind11 package from pypi.\n  * building on macos is known to work, but has been known to fail.\n    for example, the system python may not know which compiler flags\n    to set when building bindings for software installed by homebrew;\n    see https://docs.brew.sh/homebrew-and-python#brewed-python-modules.\n  * building on windows has not been tested yet and will probably fail.\n",
