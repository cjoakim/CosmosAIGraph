  "description": "===============================\ngetting started with grafanalib\n===============================\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/grafanalib/badge/?version=latest\n    :alt: documentation status\n    :scale: 100%\n    :target: https://grafanalib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n\ndo you like `grafana <http://grafana.org/>`_ but wish you could version your\ndashboard configuration? do you find yourself repeating common patterns? if\nso, grafanalib is for you.\n\ngrafanalib lets you generate grafana dashboards from simple python scripts.\n\nhow it works\n============\n\ntake a look at `the examples directory\n<https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/blob/main/grafanalib/tests/examples/>`_,\ne.g. `this dashboard\n<https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/blob/main/grafanalib/tests/examples/example.dashboard.py>`_\nwill configure a dashboard with a single row, with one qps graph broken down\nby status code and another latency graph showing median and 99th percentile\nlatency.\n\nin the code is a fair bit of repetition here, but once you figure out what\nworks for your needs, you can factor that out.\nsee `our weave-specific customizations\n<https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/blob/main/grafanalib/weave.py>`_\nfor inspiration.\n\nyou can read the entire grafanlib documentation on `readthedocs.io\n<https://grafanalib.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\ngetting started\n===============\n\ngrafanalib is just a python package, so:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n  $ pip install grafanalib\n\n\ngenerate the json dashboard like so:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n  $ curl -o example.dashboard.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/main/grafanalib/tests/examples/example.dashboard.py\n  $ generate-dashboard -o frontend.json example.dashboard.py\n\n\nsupport\n=======\n\nthis library is in its very early stages. we'll probably make changes that\nbreak backwards compatibility, although we'll try hard not to.\n\ngrafanalib works with python 3.6 through 3.10.\n\ndeveloping\n==========\nif you're working on the project, and need to build from source, it's done as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n  $ virtualenv .env\n  $ . ./.env/bin/activate\n  $ pip install -e .\n\nconfiguring grafana datasources\n===============================\n\nthis repo used to contain a program ``gfdatasource`` for configuring\ngrafana data sources, but it has been retired since grafana now has a\nbuilt-in way to do it.  see https://grafana.com/docs/administration/provisioning/#datasources\n\ncommunity\n=========\n\nwe currently don't follow a roadmap for ``grafanalib`` and both `maintainers\n<https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/blob/main/maintainers>` have recently\nbecome somewhat occupied otherwise.\n\nwe'd like you to join the ``grafanalib`` community! if you would like to\nhelp out maintaining ``grafanalib`` that would be great. it's a fairly laid-back\nand straight-forward project. please talk to us on slack (see the links below).\n\nwe follow the `cncf code of conduct </docs/code_of_conduct.rst>`_.\n\ngetting help\n------------\n\nif you have any questions about, feedback for or problems with ``grafanalib``:\n\n- read the documentation at https://grafanalib.readthedocs.io\n- invite yourself to the `weave users slack <https://slack.weave.works/>`_.\n- ask a question on the `#grafanalib <https://weave-community.slack.com/messages/grafanalib/>`_ slack channel.\n- `file an issue <https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib/issues/new>`_.\n\nyour feedback is always welcome!\n\n\n",
