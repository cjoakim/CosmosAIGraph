  "description": "|buildstatus| |supported python versions|\n\nan earley algorithm parser toolkit.\n===========================================\n\nthis package uses jay earley's algorithm for parsing context free\ngrammars, and comes with some generic abstract syntax tree\nroutines. there is also a prototype scanner which does its job by\ncombining python regular expressions.\n\n(spark stands for scanning, parsing, and rewriting kit. it is a poor\nname since it conflicts with a more popular package of the same\nname. in the future we will rename this.)\n\nthe original version of this was written by john aycock for his ph.d\nthesis and was described in his 1998 paper: \"compiling little\nlanguages in python\" at the 7th international python conference. the\ncurrent incarnation of this code is maintained (or not) by rocky\nbernstein.\n\nnote: earley algorithm parsers are almost linear when given an lr grammar.\nthese are grammars which are left-recursive.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nthis uses `setup.py`, so it follows the standard python routine:\n\n::\n\n    python setup.py install # may need sudo\n    # or if you have pyenv:\n    python setup.py develop\n\nexample\n-------\n\nthe github `example` directory_ has a worked-out examples; package uncompyle6_\nuses this and contains a much larger example.\n\nsee also\n--------\n\n* features_\n* http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/spark/ (old and not very well maintained)\n* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncompyle6/\n\n.. _features: https://github.com/rocky/python-spark/blob/master/new-features.rst\n.. _directory: https://github.com/rocky/python-spark/tree/master/example\n.. _uncompyle6: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncompyle6/\n.. |downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dd/spark.svg\n.. |buildstatus| image:: https://travis-ci.org/rocky/python-spark.svg\n\t\t :target: https://travis-ci.org/rocky/python-spark\n.. |supported python versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/spark_parser.svg\n\n\n\n",
