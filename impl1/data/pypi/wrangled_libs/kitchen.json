  "description": "\nwe've all done it.  in the process of writing a brand new application we've\ndiscovered that we need a little bit of code that we've invented before.\nperhaps it's something to handle unicode text.  perhaps it's something to make\na bit of python-2.5 code run on python-2.3.  whatever it is, it ends up being\na tiny bit of code that seems too small to worry about pushing into its own\nmodule so it sits there, a part of your current project, waiting to be cut and\npasted into your next project.  and the next.  and the next.  and since that\nlittle bittybit of code proved so useful to you, it's highly likely that it\nproved useful to someone else as well.  useful enough that they've written it\nand copy and pasted it over and over into each of their new projects.\n\nwell, no longer!  kitchen aims to pull these small snippets of code into a few\npython modules which you can import and use within your project.  no more copy\nand paste!  now you can let someone else maintain and release these small\nsnippets so that you can get on with your life.\n",
