  "description": "spylls: hunspell ported to python\n=================================\n\n**spylls** is an effort of porting prominent spellcheckers into clear, well-structured, well-documented python. it is intended to be useful both as a library and as some kind of \"reference (or investigatory, if you will) implementation\". currently, only `hunspell <https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell>`_ is ported.\n\nhunspell is a long-living, complicated, almost undocumented piece of software, and it was our feeling that the significant part of human knowledge is somehow \"locked\" in a form of a large c++ project. that's how **spylls** was born: as an attempt to \"unlock\" it, via well-structured and well-documented implementation in a high-level language.\n\n**follow the explanatory blog post series:** `on my blog <https://zverok.github.io/spellchecker.html>`_, `on medium <https://medium.com/spylls-rebuilding-the-spellchecker>`_, or `subscribe to my mailing list <https://zverok.github.io/subscribe.html>`_.\n\nusage as a library\n------------------\n\n::\n\n  $ pip install spylls\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  from spylls.hunspell import dictionary\n\n  # en_us dictionary is distributed with spylls\n  # see docs to load other dictionaries\n  dictionary = dictionary.from_files('en_us')\n\n  print(dictionary.lookup('spylls'))\n  # false\n  for suggestion in dictionary.suggest('spylls'):\n      print(suggestion)\n  # spells\n  # spills\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nfull documentation, including detailed source code/algorithms walkthrough, more detailed reasoning and some completeness reports, is available at https://spylls.readthedocs.io/.\n\nproject links\n-------------\n\n- docs: https://spylls.readthedocs.io/\n- github: https://github.com/zverok/spylls\n- pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spylls\n- issues: https://github.com/spylls/spylls/issues\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nmpl 2.0. see the bundled `license <https://github.com/spylls/spylls/blob/master/license>`_ file for more details.\nnote that being an \"explanatory rewrite\", spylls should considered a derivative work of hunspell, and so would be all of its ports/rewrites.\n\nwe are incredibly grateful to hunspell's original authors and current maintainers for all the hard work they've put into the most used spellchecker in the world!\n\n\n",
