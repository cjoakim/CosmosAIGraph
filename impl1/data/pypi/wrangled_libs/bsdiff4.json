  "description": "=======================================================\nbsdiff4: binary diff and patch using the bsdiff4-format\n=======================================================\n\nthe code is mostly derived from cx_bsdiff (written by anthony tuininga,\nhttp://cx-bsdiff.sourceforge.net/).  the cx_bsdiff code in turn was derived\nfrom bsdiff, the standalone utility produced for bsd which can be found\nat http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff.\nin addition to the two functions (diff and patch) cx_bsdiff provides, this\npackage includes:\n\n* an interface to the bsdiff4-format\n* command line interfaces: bsdiff4 and bspatch4\n* tests\n\n\nthe bsdiff4 package defines the following high level functions:\n\n``diff(src_bytes, dst_bytes)`` -> bytes\n   return a bsdiff4-format patch (from ``src_bytes`` to ``dst_bytes``) as\n   bytes.\n\n``patch(src_bytes, patch_bytes)`` -> bytes\n   apply the bsdiff4-format ``patch_bytes`` to ``src_bytes`` and return\n   the bytes.\n\n``file_diff(src_path, dst_path, patch_path)``\n   write a bsdiff4-format patch (from the file ``src_path`` to the\n   file ``dst_path``) to the file ``patch_path``.\n\n``file_patch(src_path, dst_path, patch_path)``\n   apply the bsdiff4-format file ``patch_path`` to the file ``src_path``\n   and write the result to the file ``dst_path``.\n\n``file_patch_inplace(path, patch_path)``\n   apply the bsdiff4-format file ``patch_path`` to the file ``path``\n   in place.\n\n\nexample:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   >>> import bsdiff4\n   >>> a = 100000 * b'a'\n   >>> b = bytearray(a)\n   >>> b[100:106] = b' diff '\n   >>> p = bsdiff4.diff(a, bytes(b))\n   >>> len(p)\n   154\n   >>> bsdiff4.patch(a, p) == b\n   true\n",
