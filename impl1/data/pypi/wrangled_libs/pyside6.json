  "description": "# pyside6\n\n### introduction\n\n**important:** for qt5 compatibility, check [pyside2](https://pypi.org/project/pyside2)\n\npyside6 is the official python module from the\n[qt for python project](https://wiki.qt.io/qt_for_python),\nwhich provides access to the complete qt 6.0+ framework.\n\nthe qt for python project is developed in the open, with all facilities you'd expect\nfrom any modern oss project such as all code in a git repository and an open\ndesign process. we welcome any contribution conforming to the\n[qt contribution agreement](https://www.qt.io/contributionagreement/).\n\n### installation\n\nsince the release of the [technical preview](https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/06/13/qt-python-5-11-released/)\nit is possible to install via `pip`, both from qt's servers\nand [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyside6/):\n\n```\npip install pyside6\n```\n\n> please note: this wheel is an alias to other two wheels\n> [pyside6_essentials](https://pypi.org/project/pyside6_essentials) and\n> [pyside6_addons](https://pypi.org/project/pyside6_addons), which contains\n> a predefined list of qt modules.\n\n#### dependencies\n\npyside6 versions following 6.0 use a c++ parser based on\n[clang](http://clang.org/). the clang library (c-bindings), version 13.0 or\nhigher is required for building. prebuilt versions of it can be downloaded from\n[download.qt.io](https://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/libclang/).\n\nafter unpacking the archive, set the environment variable *llvm_install_dir* to\npoint to the folder containing the *include* and *lib* directories of clang:\n\n```\n7z x .../libclang-release_100-linux-rhel7.2-gcc5.3-x86_64-clazy.7z\nexport llvm_install_dir=$pwd/libclang\n```\n\non windows:\n\n```\n7z x .../libclang-release_100-windows-vs2015_64-clazy.7z\nset llvm_install_dir=%cd%\\libclang\n```\n\n### building from source\n\nfor building pyside6 from scratch, please read about\n[getting started](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/gettingstarted.html).\nthis process will include getting the code:\n\n```\ngit clone https://code.qt.io/pyside/pyside-setup\ncd pyside-setup\ngit checkout 6.x # if a specific version is needed\n```\n\nthen install the dependencies, and following the instructions per platform.\na common build command will look like:\n\n```\npython setup.py install --qtpaths=/path/to/bin/qtpaths6 --parallel=8 --build-tests\n```\n\nyou can obtain more information about the options to build pyside and shiboken\nin [our wiki](https://wiki.qt.io/qt_for_python/).\n\n### documentation and bugs\n\nyou can find more information about the pyside6 module api in the\n[official qt for python documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/).\n\nif you come across any issue, please file a bug report at our\n[jira tracker](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/pyside) following\nour [guidelines](https://wiki.qt.io/qt_for_python/reporting_bugs).\n\n### community\n\ncheck our channels on irc (libera), telegram, gitter, matrix, and mailing list,\nand [join our community](https://wiki.qt.io/qt_for_python#community)!\n\n### licensing\n\npyside6 is available under both open source (lgplv3/gplv2) and commercial\nlicense. using pypi is the recommended installation source, because the\ncontent of the wheels is valid for both cases. for more information, refer to\nthe [qt licensing page](https://www.qt.io/licensing/).\n",
