  "description": "bazel-runfiles library\n======================\n\nthis is a bazel runfiles lookup library for bazel-built python binaries and tests.\n\nlearn about runfiles: read `runfiles guide <https://bazel.build/extending/rules#runfiles>`_\nor watch `fabian's bazelcon talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nbgumh1ogo>`_.\n\ntypical usage\n-------------\n\n1.  add the 'bazel-runfiles' dependency along with other third-party dependencies, for example in your\n    ``requirements.txt`` file.\n\n2.  depend on this runfiles library from your build rule, like you would other third-party libraries::\n\n      py_binary(\n          name = \"my_binary\",\n          ...\n          deps = [requirement(\"bazel-runfiles\")],\n      )\n\n3.  import the runfiles library::\n\n      import runfiles  # not \"from runfiles import runfiles\"\n\n4.  create a runfiles object and use rlocation to look up runfile paths::\n\n      r = runfiles.create()\n      ...\n      with open(r.rlocation(\"my_workspace/path/to/my/data.txt\"), \"r\") as f:\n        contents = f.readlines()\n        ...\n\n    the code above creates a manifest- or directory-based implementations based\n    on the environment variables in os.environ. see `create()` for more info.\n\n    if you want to explicitly create a manifest- or directory-based\n    implementations, you can do so as follows::\n\n      r1 = runfiles.createmanifestbased(\"path/to/foo.runfiles_manifest\")\n\n      r2 = runfiles.createdirectorybased(\"path/to/foo.runfiles/\")\n\n    if you want to start subprocesses, and the subprocess can't automatically\n    find the correct runfiles directory, you can explicitly set the right\n    environment variables for them::\n\n      import subprocess\n      import runfiles\n\n      r = runfiles.create()\n      env = {}\n      ...\n      env.update(r.envvars())\n      p = subprocess.popen([r.rlocation(\"path/to/binary\")], env, ...)\n",
