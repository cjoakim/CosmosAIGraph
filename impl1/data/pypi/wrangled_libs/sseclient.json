  "description": "=================\npython sse client\n=================\n\nthis is a python client library for iterating over http server sent event (sse)\nstreams (also known as eventsource, after the name of the javascript interface\ninside browsers).  the sseclient class accepts a url on init, and is then an\niterator over messages coming from the server.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nuse pip::\n\n    pip install sseclient\n\nusage\n-----\n\n::\n\n    from sseclient import sseclient\n\n    messages = sseclient('http://mysite.com/sse_stream/')\n    for msg in messages:\n        do_something_useful(msg)\n\neach message object will have a 'data' attribute, as well as optional 'event',\n'id', and 'retry' attributes.\n\noptional init parameters:\n\n- last_id: if provided, this parameter will be sent to the server to tell it to\n  return only messages more recent than this id.\n\n- retry: number of milliseconds to wait after disconnects before attempting to\n  reconnect.  the server may change this by including a 'retry' line in a\n  message.  retries are handled automatically by the sseclient object.\n\nyou may also provide any additional keyword arguments supported by the\nrequests_ library, such as a 'headers' dict and a (username, password) tuple\nfor 'auth'.\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n\ninstall the library in editable mode::\n\n    pip install -e .\n\ninstall the test dependencies::\n\n    pip install pytest backports.unittest_mock\n\nrun the tests with py.test::\n\n    (sseclient)vagrant sseclient $ py.test\n    ===================== test session starts ======================\n    platform linux2 -- python 2.7.6 -- py-1.4.30 -- pytest-2.7.2\n    rootdir: /vagrant/code/sseclient, inifile: \n    plugins: backports.unittest-mock\n    collected 11 items \n\n    test_sseclient.py ...........\n\n    ================== 11 passed in 0.19 seconds ===================\n\nthere are a couple todo items in the code for getting the implementation\ncompletely in line with the finer points of the sse spec.\n\nadditional resources\n--------------------\n\n- `html5rocks tutorial`_\n- `official sse spec`_\n\n.. _requests: https://requests.readthedocs.io/\n.. _html5rocks tutorial: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/\n.. _official sse spec: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#server-sent-events",
