  "description": "# causal-learn: causal discovery in python\n\ncausal-learn is a python package for causal discovery that implements both classical and state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms, which is a python translation and extension of [tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad).\n\nthe package is actively being developed. feedbacks (issues, suggestions, etc.) are highly encouraged.\n\n# package overview\n\nour causal-learn implements methods for causal discovery:\n\n* constraint-based causal discovery methods.\n* score-based causal discovery methods.\n* causal discovery methods based on constrained functional causal models.\n* hidden causal representation learning.\n* permutation-based causal discovery methods.\n* granger causality.\n* multiple utilities for building your own method, such as independence tests, score functions, graph operations, and evaluations.\n\n# install\n\ncausal-learn needs the following packages to be installed beforehand:\n\n* python 3 (>=3.7)\n* numpy\n* networkx\n* pandas\n* scipy\n* scikit-learn\n* statsmodels\n* pydot\n\n(for visualization)\n\n* matplotlib\n* graphviz\n\nto use causal-learn, we could install it using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/causal-learn/):\n\n```\npip install causal-learn\n```\n\n\n# documentation\n\nplease kindly refer to [causal-learn doc](https://causal-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for detailed tutorials and usages.\n\n# running examples\n\nfor search methods in causal discovery, there are various running examples in the **\u2018tests\u2019** directory, such as testpc.py and testges.py.\n\nfor the implemented modules, such as (conditional) independent test methods, we provide unit tests for the convenience of developing your own methods.\n\n# benchmarks\n\nfor the convenience of our community, [cmu-clear](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality) group maintains a list of benchmark datasets including real-world scenarios and various learning tasks. please refer to the following links:\n\n* [https://github.com/cmu-phil/example-causal-datasets](https://github.com/cmu-phil/example-causal-datasets) (maintained by joseph ramsey)\n* [https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality/projects/causal_learn_benchmarks](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality/projects/causal_learn_benchmarks)\n\nplease feel free to let us know if you have any recommendation regarding causal datasets with high-quality. we are grateful for any effort that benefits the development of causality community.\n\n\n# contribution\n\nplease feel free to open an issue if you find anything unexpected.\nand please create pull requests, perhaps after passing unittests in 'tests/', if you would like to contribute to causal-learn.\nwe are always targeting to make our community better!\n\n# running tetrad in python\n\nalthough causal-learn provides python implementations for some causal discovery algorithms, there are currently a lot more in the classical java-based [tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) program. for users who would like to incorporate arbitrary java code in tetrad as part of a python workflow, we strongly recommend considering [py-tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad). here is a list of [reusable examples](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad/tree/main/pytetrad) of how to painlessly benefit from the most comprehensive tetrad java codebase.\n\n# citation\n\nplease cite as:\n\n```\n@article{causallearn,\n  title={causal-learn: causal discovery in python},\n  author={yujia zheng and biwei huang and wei chen and joseph ramsey and mingming gong and ruichu cai and shohei shimizu and peter spirtes and kun zhang},\n  journal={arxiv preprint arxiv:2307.16405},\n  year={2023}\n}\n```\n",
