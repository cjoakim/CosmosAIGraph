  "description": "# ubiquerg\n\n![run pytests](https://github.com/pepkit/ubiquerg/workflows/run%20pytests/badge.svg)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/pepkit/ubiquerg/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/pepkit/ubiquerg)\n[![pep compatible](https://pepkit.github.io/img/pep-compatible-green.svg)](https://pepkit.github.io)\n\nubiquerg is a utility package with a collection of helpful universally useful functions. the name means work (erg) everywhere (ubique), indicating our intention for these to be low-level functions that can be used in lots of different places. functions are divided into groups, including:\n\n- collection\n- environment\n- files\n- paths\n- system\n- web\n- cli_tools\n\n## development guidelines\n\n- ubiquerg should have no dependencies outside of standard built-in python modules. please do not add any functions that introduce a new dependency.\n- functions should be generic. they should perform basic, low-level processing that is not specific to a particular application.\n- functions should only be added to ubiquerg if they are used in at least 2 existing modules.\n- functions should be kept relatively small and simple (ideally <50 lines of code).\n",
