if you want them to\ninstead be stopped early, use pytest-timeout_.\n\n.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org\n.. _pytest-timeout: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-timeout\n\n\ninstallation\n============\n``pytest-fail-slow`` requires python 3.7 or higher and pytest 6.0 or higher.\njust use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ for python 3 (you have pip, right?) to\ninstall it::\n\n    python3 -m pip install pytest-fail-slow\n\n\nusage\n=====\n\nfailing slow tests\n------------------\n\nto cause a specific test to fail if it takes too long to run, apply the\n``fail_slow`` marker to it, with the desired cutoff time as the argument:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import pytest\n\n    @pytest.mark.fail_slow(\"5s\")\n    def test_something_sluggish():\n        ...\n\nin addition, the ``--fail-slow duration`` option can be passed to the\n``pytest`` command to affect all tests in that run.  if ``--fail-slow`` is\ngiven and a test has the ``fail_slow`` marker, the duration given by the marker\ntakes precedence for that test.\n\nif a test fails due to being slow, pytest's output will include the test's\nduration and the duration threshold, like so::\n\n    ________________________________ test_func ________________________________\n    test passed but took too long to run: duration 123.0s > 5.0s\n\n**note:** this feature only takes the durations for tests themselves into\nconsideration.  if a test passes in less than the specified duration, but one\nor more fixture setups/teardowns take longer than the duration, the test will\nstill be marked as passing.  to fail a test if the setup takes too long, see\nbelow.\n\n\nfailing slow setups\n-------------------\n\n*new in version 0.4.0*\n\nto cause a specific test to fail if the setup steps for all of its fixtures\ncombined take too long to run, apply the ``fail_slow_setup`` marker to it, with\nthe desired cutoff time as the argument:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import pytest\n\n    @pytest.mark.fail_slow_setup(\"5s\")\n    def test_costly_resource(slow_to_create):\n        ...\n\ndo not apply the marker to the test's fixtures; markers have no effect on\nfixtures.\n\nin addition, the ``--fail-slow-setup duration`` option can be passed to the\n``pytest`` command to affect all tests in that run.  if ``--fail-slow-setup``\nis given and a test has the ``fail_slow_setupresou`` marker, the duration given\nby the marker takes precedence for that test.\n\nif the setup for a test takes too long to run, the test will be marked as\n\"errored,\" the test itself will not be run, and pytest's output will include\nthe setup stage's duration and the duration threshold, like so::\n\n    _______________________ error at setup of test_func _______________________\n    setup passed but took too long to run: duration 123.0s > 5.0s\n\n**note:** if a test depends on multiple fixtures and just one of them exceeds\nthe given duration on its own, the remaining fixtures will still have their\nsetup steps run.  also, all fixture teardowns will still be run after the test\nwould have run.\n\n\nspecifying durations\n--------------------\n\na duration passed to a marker or command-line option can be either a bare\nnumber of seconds or else a floating-point number followed by one of the\nfollowing units (case insensitive):\n\n- ``h``, ``hour``, ``hours``\n- ``m``, ``min``, ``mins``, ``minute``, ``minutes``\n- ``s``, ``sec``, ``secs``, ``second``, ``seconds``\n- ``ms``, ``milli``, ``millisec``, ``milliseconds``\n- ``us``, ``\u03bcs``, ``micro``, ``microsec``, ``microseconds``\n",
