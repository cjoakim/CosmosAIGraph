  "description": "============\r\npytest-cover\r\n============\r\n\r\n`pytest-cover` has been merged back into `pytest-cov 2.0 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov>`_.\r\n\r\nchangelog\r\n=========\r\n\r\n2.0.2 (2015-07-08)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* fixed a race condition when running with xdist (all the workers tried to combine the files).\r\n\r\n2.0.1 (2015-07-06)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* avoid warning about missing coverage data (just like ``coverage.control.process_startup``).\r\n* don't setup the multiprocessing finalizer if there's no coverage active.\r\n\r\n2.0.0 (2015-06-29)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* renamed ``--cov-min`` to ``--cov-fail-under`` to be consistent with the new ``fail_under`` option in `coverage-4.0`.\r\n* changed ``--cov-report=term`` to automatically upgrade to ``--cov-report=term-missing`` if there's ``[run] show_missing = true`` in\r\n  ``.coveragerc``.\r\n* changed ``--cov-fail-under`` to be automatically activated if there's a ``[report] fail_under = ...`` in ``.coveragerc``.\r\n\r\n1.0.0 (2015-06-05)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* fixed `.pth` installation to work in all cases (install, easy_install, wheels, develop etc).\r\n* fixed `.pth` uninstallation to work for wheel installs.\r\n* reverted the unreleased ``--cov=path`` deprecation.\r\n* removed the unreleased addition of ``--cov-source=path``.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* forked from the `2.0` branch of https://github.com/schlamar/pytest-cov/ - fixes include:\r\n\r\n  * no need to specify the source anymore via ``--cov``. the source settings from\r\n    ``.coveragerc`` will be used instead.\r\n  * support for ``--cov-min``.",
