  "description": "cityhash\n========\n\na fork of python wrapper around `cityhash <https://github.com/google/cityhash>`__\nwith downgraded version of algorithm. this fork used as 3-rd party library\nfor hashing data in clickhouse protocol. unfortunately clickhouse\nserver comes with built-in old version of this algorithm.\n\nplease use original `python-cityhash <https://github.com/escherba/python-cityhash>`_\npackage for other purposes.\n\ngetting started\n---------------\n\nto use this package in your program, simply type\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install clickhouse-cityhash\n\nsee also\n--------\nfor other fast non-cryptographic hashing implementations available as python\nextensions, see `metrohash <https://github.com/escherba/python-metrohash>`__\nand `xxh <https://github.com/lebedov/xxh>`__.\n\nauthors\n-------\nthe python bindings were originally written by alexander [amper] marshalov and\nwere subsequently edited for more speed/versatility and packaged for pypi by\neugene scherba. the original cityhash algorithm is by google.\n\nlicense\n-------\nthis software is licensed under the `mit license\n<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license>`_.  see the included license\nfile for more information.",
