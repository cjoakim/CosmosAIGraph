https://coveralls.io/repos/reinout/createcoverage/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\n  :target: https://coveralls.io/github/reinout/createcoverage?branch=master\n\nthis package installs one command: ``createcoverage`` that runs your tests\nwith coverage.py and opens the coverage reports in your browser.  all with\njust one single handy command.\n\nassumption: you're using buildout.  or rather, the assumption is that you have\na ``bin/test`` command that runs all your tests.\n\nno options are passed to coverage.py, so any extra options you want to give to\ncoverage must be put in a ``.coveragerc`` in your buildout's root.  this is a\ngood idea in any case :-)  an example .coveragerc that omits code you normally\ndon't want to include in a coverage report::\n\n    [report]\n    omit =\n        /home/*/.buildout/eggs/*\n        /usr/*\n        parts/*\n        eggs/*\n        */test*\n\ninstalling ``createcoverage`` in a zc.recipe.egg section is enough.\ncreatecoverage itself depends on `coverage.py\n<http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`_ and makes sure ``bin/coverage`` is\ncreated::\n\n    [console_scripts]\n    recipe = zc.recipe.egg\n    eggs = createcoverage\n\n\ncode, bugs, ideas\n-----------------\n\nthe code is hosted at github: https://github.com/reinout/createcoverage\n.\n\nyou can also report `issues and bugs and ideas\n<https://github.com/reinout/createcoverage/issues>`_ there. pull\nrequests are of course also very welcome :-)\n\n\ndevelopment installation\n------------------------\n\nthe first time, you'll have to run the \"bootstrap\" script to set up setuptools\nand buildout::\n\n    $ python bootstrap.py\n\nand then run buildout to set everything up::\n\n    $ bin/buildout\n\n(on windows it is called ``bin\\buildout.exe``).\n\nyou'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in\n``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.\n\nthe current package is installed as a \"development package\", so\nchanges in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python\nsetup.py develop``).\n\ntests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\\test.exe``.\n\n\ncredits\n=======\n\ncreated by `reinout van rees <http://reinout.vanrees.org>`_.\n\n\nchangelog of createcoverage\n===========================\n\n1.5 (2016-02-02)\n----------------\n\n- fixed ``bin/coverage`` script (it pointed at an old entry point). note that\n  this script is only included because buildout originally didn't install\n  scripts of dependencies. it *does* now, with the proper configuration. but\n  installing this script ourselves solves every case.\n\n\n1.4.1 (2015-11-11)\n------------------\n\n- upped the coverage requirement (to 3.7). coveralls.io's library needs 3.6\n  and this makes it a bit easier to make sure there's a new enough release.\n\n\n1.4 (2015-09-17)\n----------------\n\n- note: no functional changes in this release.\n\n- moved to github: https://github.com/reinout/createcoverage .\n\n- noted (in the ``setup.py`` classifiers) that we work just fine with\n  python 3!\n\n- set up travis testing and coveralls.io integration. 100% coverage, of course\n  :-)\n\n\n1.3.2 (2014-12-09)\n------------------\n\n- packaging fix. nothing changed (functionally) compared to 1.3.\n\n\n1.3.1 (2014-12-09)\n------------------\n\n- some internal cleanup and a small pypi metadata fix.\n\n\n1.3 (2014-12-09)\n----------------\n\n- added ``-t/--test-args`` command line option. the string passed to\n  that is passed straight on to the test runner. for instance, use\n  ``-t \"-m somemodule\"`` to effectively run ``bin/test -m\n  somemodule``. note the need for quotes (single or double) as you're\n  using an option to pass options... fix by godefroid chapelle,\n  thanks!\n\n\n1.2 (2012-06-28)\n----------------\n\n- fixed a problem with opening the coverage ``index.html`` file on os x when\n  using python 2.7 or newer by using a file url instead of a path.\n\n\n1.1 (2011-04-19)\n----------------\n\n- making the path to the coverage index.html file absolute before opening it\n  in the webbrowser. this prevents osx from complaining that it isn't a url.\n\n\n1.0 (2010-12-20)\n----------------\n\n- added option (\"-d\") for specifying an output directory.  specifying it also\n  makes sure the results aren't opened in a webbrowser (as the option is\n  intended for offline operation for automatic documentation generation\n  purposes).\n\n\n0.4 (2010-10-05)\n----------------\n\n- falling back to global 'coverage' binary if there isn't one in\n  ``bin/coverage``.\n\n\n0.3 (2010-09-20)\n----------------\n\n- added missing manifest.in file so that the distribution on pypi is complete\n  now.\n\n\n0.2 (2010-09-20)\n----------------\n\n- documentation update: pointing at bitbucket for code, issues, ideas.\n\n\n0.1 (2010-09-20)\n----------------\n\n- first working version.\n\n- copied some code from the \"createzopecoverage\" package.\n\n- initial library skeleton created by nensskel.
