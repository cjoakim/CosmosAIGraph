  "description": "## aws cloudformation resource provider go plugin\n\nthe cloudformation cli (cfn) allows you to author your own resource providers that can be used by cloudformation.\n\nthis plugin library helps to provide go runtime bindings for the execution of your providers by cloudformation.\n\nusage\n-----\n\nif you are using this package to build resource providers for cloudformation, install the [cloudformation cli go plugin](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli-go-plugin) - this will automatically install the the [cloudformation cli](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli)! a python virtual environment is recommended.\n\n```bash\npip3 install cloudformation-cli-go-plugin\n```\n\nrefer to the documentation for the [cloudformation cli](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli) for usage instructions.\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n\nfor changes to the plugin, a python virtual environment is recommended. check out and install the plugin in editable mode:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip3 install -e /path/to/cloudformation-cli-go-plugin\n```\n\nyou may also want to check out the [cloudformation cli](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli) if you wish to make edits to that. in this case, installing them in one operation works well:\n\n```bash\npip3 install \\\n  -e /path/to/cloudformation-cli \\\n  -e /path/to/cloudformation-cli-go-plugin\n```\n\nthat ensures neither is accidentally installed from pypi.\n\nlinting and running unit tests is done via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), and so is performed automatically on commit. the continuous integration also runs these checks. manual options are available so you don't have to commit:\n\n```bash\n# run all hooks on all files, mirrors what the ci runs\npre-commit run --all-files\n# run unit tests only. can also be used for other hooks, e.g. black, isort, pytest-local\npre-commit run pytest-local\n```\n\nuse `./generate-examples.sh` to run install `cloudformation-cli-go-plugin` locally and run `cfn generate` in each example.\n\ngetting started\n---------------\n\nthis plugin create a sample go project and requires golang 1.8 or above and [godep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/introduction.html). for more information on installing and setting up your go environment, please visit the official [golang site](https://golang.org/).\n\ncommunity\n---------------\n\njoin us on discord! connect & interact with cloudformation developers &\nexperts, find channels to discuss and get help for cfn-lint, cloudformation registry, stacksets,\nguard and more:\n\n[![join our discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/981586120448020580/widget.png?style=banner3)](https://discord.gg/9zpd7ttrwq)\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nthis library is licensed under the apache 2.0 license.\n",
