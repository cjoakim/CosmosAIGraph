  "description": "*python-pptx* is a python library for creating, reading, and updating powerpoint (.pptx)\nfiles.\n\na typical use would be generating a powerpoint presentation from dynamic content such as\na database query, analytics output, or a json payload, perhaps in response to an http\nrequest and downloading the generated pptx file in response. it runs on any python\ncapable platform, including macos and linux, and does not require the powerpoint\napplication to be installed or licensed.\n\nit can also be used to analyze powerpoint files from a corpus, perhaps to extract search\nindexing text and images.\n\nin can also be used to simply automate the production of a slide or two that would be\ntedious to get right by hand, which is how this all got started.\n\nmore information is available in the `python-pptx documentation`_.\n\nbrowse `examples with screenshots`_ to get a quick idea what you can do with\npython-pptx.\n\n.. _`python-pptx documentation`:\n   https://python-pptx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\n.. _`examples with screenshots`:\n   https://python-pptx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/quickstart.html\n\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nrelease history\n---------------\n\n0.6.23 (2023-11-02)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- fix: #912 pillow<=9.5 constraint entails security vulnerability\n\n\n0.6.22 (2023-08-28)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- add #909

fix: #748 setup's `license` should be short string\n- fix: #762 attributeerror: module 'collections' has no attribute 'abc'\n       (windows python 3.10+)\n\n\n0.6.21 (2021-09-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- fix #741 _dirpkgreader must implement .__contains__()\n\n\n0.6.20 (2021-09-14)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- fix #206 accommodate null target-references in relationships.\n- fix #223 escape image filename that appears as literal in xml.\n- fix #517 option to display chart categories/values in reverse order.\n- major refactoring of ancient package loading

represented as an icon.\n\n\n0.6.18 (2019-05-02)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- .text property getters encode line-break as a vertical-tab (vt, '\\v', ascii 11/x0b).\n  this is consistent with powerpoint's copy/paste behavior and allows like-breaks (soft\n  carriage-return) to be distinguished from paragraph boundary. previously, a line-break\n  was encoded as a newline ('\\n') and was not distinguishable from a paragraph boundary.\n\n  .text properties include shape.text, _cell.text, textframe.text, _paragraph.text and\n  _run.text.\n\n- .text property setters accept vertical-tab character and place a line-break element in\n  that location. all other control characters other than horizontal-tab ('\\t') and\n  newline ('\\n') in range \\x00-\\x1f are accepted and escaped with plain-text like\n  \"_x001b\" for esc (ascii 27).\n\n  previously a control character other than tab or newline in an assigned string would\n  trigger an exception related to invalid xml character.\n\n\n0.6.17 (2018-12-16)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- add slidelayouts.remove() - delete unused slide-layout\n- add slidelayout.used_by_slides - get slides based on this slide-layout\n- add

`shadowformat` object.\n- add `shadowformat` object with read/write (boolean) `.inherit` property.\n- fix #328 add support for 26+ series in a chart\n\n\n0.6.9 (2018-05-08)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- add `picture.crop_x` setters, allowing picture cropping values to be set,\n  in addition to interrogated.\n- add `slide.background` and `slidemaster.background`, allowing the\n  background fill to be set for an individual slide or for all slides based\n  on a slide master.\n- add option `shapes` parameter to `shapes.add_group_shape`, allowing a group\n  shape to be formed from a number of existing shapes.\n- improve efficiency of `shapes._next_shape_id` property to improve\n  performance on high shape-count slides.\n\n\n0.6.8 (2018-04-18)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- add `groupshape`, providing

be specified and added to a slide.\n- add support for patterned fills.\n- add `lineformat.dash_style` to allow interrogation and setting of dashed\n  line styles.\n\n\n0.6.6 (2017-06-17)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- add `slideshapes.add_movie()`, allowing video media to be added to a slide.\n\n- fix #190 accommodate non-conforming part names having '00' index segment.\n- fix

hierarchical categories in an\n  existing chart.\n- add support for date axes on category charts, including writing a dateax\n  element for the category axis when chartdata categories are date or\n  datetime.\n\n**backward incompatibilities:**\n\nsome changes were made to the boilerplate xml used to create new charts. this\nwas done to more closely adhere to the settings powerpoint uses when creating\na chart using the ui. this may result in some appearance changes in charts\nafter upgrading. in particular:\n\n* chart.has_legend now defaults to true for line charts.\n* plot.vary_by_categories now defaults to false for line charts.\n\n\n0.6.1 (2016-10-09)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- add connector shape type\n\n\n0.6.0 (2016-08-18)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- add xy chart

and .crop_bottom\n- add shape.placeholder_format and placeholderformat object\n\n**backward incompatibilities:**\n\nshape.shape_type is now unconditionally `mso_shape_type.placeholder` for all\nplaceholder shapes. previously, some placeholder shapes reported\n`mso_shape_type.auto_shape`, `mso_shape_type.chart`,\n`mso_shape_type.picture`, or `mso_shape_type.table` for that property.\n\n\n0.5.6 (2014-12-06)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- fix #138 - unicodedecodeerror in setup.py on windows 7 python 3.4\n\n\n0.5.5 (2014-11-17)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- feature #51 - add python 3

access\n  **note backward incompatibilities below**\n\n**backward incompatibilities:**\n\na table is no longer treated as a shape. rather it is a graphical object\ncontained in a graphicframe shape, as are chart and smartart objects.\n\nexample::\n\n    table = shapes.add_table(...)\n\n    # becomes\n\n    graphic_frame = shapes.add_table(...)\n    table = graphic_frame.table\n\n    # or\n\n    table = shapes.add_table(...).table\n\nas the enclosing shape, the id, name, shape type, position, and size are\nattributes of the enclosing graphicframe object.\n\nthe contents of a graphicframe shape can be identified using three available\nproperties on a shape: has_table, has_chart, and has_smart_art. the enclosed\ngraphical object is obtained using the properties graphicframe.table and\ngraphicframe.chart. smartart is not yet supported. accessing one of these\nproperties on a graphicframe not containing the corresponding object raises\nan exception.\n\n\n0.4.2

access to read and change line color and\n  width.\n- add autoshape.line\n- add picture.line\n\n- rationalize enumerations. **note backward incompatibilities below**\n\n**backward incompatibilities:**\n\nthe following enumerations were moved/renamed during the rationalization of\nenumerations:\n\n- ``pptx.enum.mso_color_type`` --> ``pptx.enum.dml.mso_color_type``\n- ``pptx.enum.mso_fill`` --> ``pptx.enum.dml.mso_fill``\n- ``pptx.enum.mso_theme_color`` --> ``pptx.enum.dml.mso_theme_color``\n- ``pptx.constants.mso.anchor_*`` --> ``pptx.enum.text.mso_anchor.*``\n-
