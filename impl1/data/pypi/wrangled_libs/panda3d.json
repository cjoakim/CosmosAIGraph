  "description": "the panda3d free 3d game engine\n===============================\n\npanda3d is a powerful 3d engine written in c++, with a complete set of python\nbindings. unlike other engines, these bindings are automatically generated,\nmeaning that they are always up-to-date and complete: all functions of the\nengine can be controlled from python. all major panda3d applications have been\nwritten in python, this is the intended way of using the engine.\n\npanda3d now supports automatic shader generation, which now means you can use\nnormal maps, gloss maps, glow maps, hdr, cartoon shading, and the like without\nhaving to write any shaders.\n\npanda3d is a modern engine supporting advanced features such as shaders,\nstencil, and render-to-texture. panda3d is unusual in that it emphasizes a\nshort learning curve, rapid development, and extreme stability and robustness.\npanda3d is free software that runs under windows, linux, or macos.\n\nthe panda3d team is very concerned with making the engine accessible to new\nusers. we provide a detailed manual, a complete api reference, and a large\ncollection of sample programs to help you get started. we have active forums,\nwith many helpful users, and the developers are regularly online to answer\nquestions.\n",
