  "description": "\n**pgsanity checks the syntax of postgresql sql files.**\n\nit does this by leveraging the ecpg command which is traditionally\nused for preparing c files with embedded sql for compilation.\nhowever, as part of that preparation, ecpg checks the embedded sql\nstatements for syntax errors using the exact same parser that is\nin postgresql.\n\nso the approach that pgsanity takes is to take a file that has a\nlist of bare sql in it, make that file look like a c file with\nembedded sql, run it through ecpg and let ecpg report on the syntax\nerrors of the sql.\n",
