colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rom1504/img2dataset/blob/master/notebook/img2dataset_getting_started.ipynb)\n[![try it on gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/try-on%20gitpod-brightgreen.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset)\n[![chat on discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/823813159592001537?color=5865f2&logo=discord&logocolor=white)](https://discord.gg/eq3camztcc)\n\neasily turn large sets of image urls to an image dataset.\ncan download, resize and package 100m urls in 20h on one machine.\n\nalso supports saving captions for url+caption datasets.\n\nif you believe in making reusable tools to make data easy to use for ml and you would like to contribute, please join the [datatoml](https://discord.gg/ep8yuutcnp) chat.\n\n## install\n\n```bash\npip install img2dataset\n```\n\nfor better performance, it's highly recommended to set up a fast dns resolver, see [this section](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset#setting-up-a-high-performance-dns-resolver)\n\n## opt-out directives\n\nwebsites can pass the http headers `x-robots-tag: noai`, `x-robots-tag: noindex` , `x-robots-tag: noimageai` and `x-robots-tag: noimageindex`\nby default img2dataset will ignore images with such headers.\n\nto disable this behavior and download all images, you may pass --disallowed_header_directives '[]'\n\nsee [ai use impact](#ai-use-impact) to understand better why you may decide to enable or disable this feature.\n\n## examples\n\nexample of datasets to download with example commands are available in the [dataset_examples](dataset_examples) folder. in particular:\n* [mscoco](dataset_examples/mscoco.md) 600k image/text pairs that can be downloaded in 10min\n* [sbucaptions](dataset_examples/sbucaptions.md) 860k image/text pairs can be downloaded in 20 mins.\n* [cc3m](dataset_examples/cc3m.md) 3m image/text pairs that can be downloaded in one hour\n* [cc12m](dataset_examples/cc12m.md) 12m image/text pairs that can be downloaded in five hour\n* [laion400m](dataset_examples/laion400m.md) 400m image/text pairs that can be downloaded in 3.5 days\n* [laion5b](dataset_examples/laion5b.md) 5b image/text pairs that can be downloaded in 7 days using 10 nodes\n* [laion-aesthetic](dataset_examples/laion-aesthetic.md) laion aesthetic is a 120m laion5b subset with aesthetic > 7 pwatermark < 0.8 punsafe < 0.5\n* [laion-art](dataset_examples/laion-art.md) laion aesthetic is a 8m laion5b subset with aesthetic > 8 pwatermark < 0.8 punsafe < 0.5\n* [laion-high-resolution](dataset_examples/laion-high-resolution.md) laion high resolution is a 170m resolution >= 1024x1024 subset of laion5b\n* [laion-face](dataset_examples/laion-face.md) laion face is the human face subset of laion-400m for large-scale face pretraining. it has 50m image-text pairs.\n* [coyo-700m](dataset_examples/coyo-700m.md) coyo is a large-scale dataset that contains 747m image-text pairs as well as many other meta-attributes to increase the usability to train various models.\n* [commonpool](dataset_examples/common_pool.md) commonpool is a large-scale dataset collected from commoncrawl containing 12.8b image-text pairs.\n* [datacomp-1b](dataset_examples/datacomp.md) datacomp-1b is a large-scale dataset with 1.4b image-text pairs filtered from commonpool.\n\nfor all these examples, you may want to tweak the resizing to your preferences. the default is 256x256 with white borders.\nsee options below.\n\n## usage\n\nfirst get some image url list. for example:\n\n```bash\necho 'https://placekitten.com/200/305' >> myimglist.txt\necho 'https://placekitten.com/200/304' >> myimglist.txt\necho 'https://placekitten.com/200/303' >> myimglist.txt\n```\n\nthen, run the tool:\n\n```bash\nimg2dataset --url_list=myimglist.txt --output_folder=output_folder --thread_count=64 --image_size=256\n```\n\nthe tool will then automatically download the urls, resize them, and store them with that format:\n* output_folder\n    * 00000\n        * 000000000.jpg\n        * 000000001.jpg\n        * 000000002.jpg\n\nor as this format if choosing webdataset:\n* output_folder\n    * 00000.tar containing:\n        * 000000000.jpg\n        * 000000001.jpg\n        * 000000002.jpg\n\nwith each number being the position in the list. the subfolders avoids having too many files in a single folder.\n\nif **captions** are provided, they will be saved as 0.txt, 1.txt, ...\n\nthis can then easily be fed into machine learning training or any other use case.\n\nalso .json files named 0.json, 1.json,... are saved with these keys:\n* url\n* caption\n* key of the form 000010005 : the first 5 digits are the shard id, the last 4 are the index in the shard\n* status : whether the download succeeded\n* error_message\n* width\n* height\n* original_width\n* original_height\n* exif\n\nalso a .parquet file will be saved with the same name as the subfolder/tar files containing these same metadata.\nit can be used to analyze the results efficiently.\n\n.json files will also be saved with the same name suffixed by _stats, they contain stats collected during downloading (download time, number of success, ...)\n\n## python

(default '[\"noai\", \"noimageai\", \"noindex\", \"noimageindex\"]')\n\n## incremental mode\n\nif a first download got interrupted for any reason, you can run again with --incremental \"incremental\" (this is the default) and using the same output folder , the same number_sample_per_shard and the same input urls, and img2dataset will complete the download.\n\n## output format choice\n\nimg2dataset support several formats. there are trade off for which to choose:\n* files: this is the simplest one, images are simply saved as files. it's good for up to 1m samples on a local file system. beyond that performance issues appear very fast. handling more than a million files in standard filesystem does not work well.\n* webdataset: webdataset format saves samples in tar files, thanks to [webdataset](https://webdataset.github.io/webdataset/) library, this makes it possible to load the resulting dataset fast in both pytorch, tensorflow and jax. choose this for most use cases. it works well for any filesystem\n* parquet: parquet is a columnar format that allows fast filtering. it's particularly easy to read it using pyarrow and pyspark. choose this if the rest of your data ecosystem is based on pyspark. [petastorm](https://github.com/uber/petastorm) can be used to read the data but it's not as easy to use as webdataset\n* tfrecord: tfrecord is a protobuf based format. it's particularly easy to use from tensorflow and using [tf data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data). use this if you plan to use the dataset only in the tensorflow ecosystem. the tensorflow writer does not use fsspec and as a consequence supports only a limited amount of filesystem, including local, hdfs, s3 and gcs. it is also less efficient than the webdataset writer when writing to other filesystems than local, losing some 30% performance.\n\n## encode format choice\n\nimages can be encoded in jpeg, png or webp, with diffent quality settings.\n\nhere are a few comparisons of space used for 1m images at 256 x 256:\n\n| format | quality | compression | size (gb)  |\n| ------ | ------- | ----------- | ---------- |\n| jpg    | 100     | n/a         | 54.2       |\n| jpg    | 95      | n/a         | 29.9       |\n| png    | n/a     | 0           | 187.9      |\n| png    | n/a     | 9           | 97.7       |\n| webp   | 100     | n/a         | 31.0       |\n| webp   | 95      | n/a         | 23.8       |\n\nnotes:\n\n* jpeg at quality 100 is not lossless\n* png format is lossless\n* webp at quality >100 is lossless ([see opencv docs](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d6a/group__imgcodecs__flags.html))\n* same quality scale between formats does not mean same image quality\n\n## filtering the dataset\n\nwhenever feasible, you should pre-filter your dataset prior to downloading.\n\nif needed, you can use:\n* --min_image_size size : to filter out images with one side smaller than size\n* --max_image_area size : to filter out images with area larger than size\n* --max_aspect_ratio ratio : to filter out images with an aspect ratio greater than ratio\n\nwhen filtering data, it is recommended to pre-shuffle your dataset to limit the impact on shard size distribution.\n\n## hashes and security\n\nsome dataset (for example laion5b) expose hashes of original images.\n\nif you want to be extra safe, you may automatically drop out the images that do not match theses hashes.\nin that case you can use `--compute_hash \"md5\" --verify_hash '[\"md5\",\"md5\"]'` \nsome of those images are actually still good but have been slightly changed by the websites.\n\n## how to tweak the options\n\nthe default values should be good enough for small sized dataset. for larger ones, these tips may help you get the best performance:\n\n* set the processes_count as the number of cores your machine has\n* increase thread_count as long as your bandwidth and cpu are below the limits\n* i advise to set output_format to webdataset if your dataset has more than 1m elements, it will be easier to manipulate few tars rather than million of files\n* keeping metadata to true can be useful to check what items were already saved and avoid redownloading them\n\nto benchmark your system, and img2dataset interactions with it, it may be interesting to enable these options (only for testing, not for real downloads)\n* --output_format dummy : will not save anything. good to remove the storage bottleneck\n* --disable_all_reencoding true : will not reencode anything. good to remove the cpu bottleneck\nwhen both these options are enabled, the only bottlenecks left are network related: eg dns setup, your bandwidth or the url servers bandwidth.\n\n## file system support\n\nthanks to [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), img2dataset supports reading and writing files in [many file systems](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/blob/6233f315548b512ec379323f762b70764efeb92c/fsspec/registry.py#l87).\nto use it, simply use the prefix of your filesystem before the path. for example `hdfs://`, `s3://`, `http://`, or `gcs://`.\nsome of these file systems require installing an additional package (for example s3fs for s3, gcsfs for gcs).\nsee fsspec doc for all the details.\n\nif you need specific configuration for your filesystem, you may handle this problem by using the [fsspec configuration system](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#configuration) that makes it possible to create a file such as `.config/fsspec/s3.json` and have information in it such as:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"s3\": {\n    \"client_kwargs\": {\n            \"endpoint_url\": \"https://some_endpoint\",\n            \"aws_access_key_id\": \"your_user\",\n           \"aws_secret_access_key\": \"your_password\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhich may be necessary if using s3 compatible file systems such as [minio](https://min.io/). that kind of configuration also work for all other fsspec-supported file systems.\n\n## distribution modes\n\nimg2dataset supports several distributors.\n* multiprocessing which spawns a process pool and use these local processes for downloading\n* pyspark which spawns workers in a spark pool to do the downloading\n\nmultiprocessing is a good option for downloading on one machine, and as such it is the default.\npyspark lets img2dataset use many nodes, which makes it as fast as the number of machines.\nit can be particularly useful if downloading datasets with more than a billion image.\n\n### pyspark configuration\n\nin order to use img2dataset with pyspark, you will need to do this:\n1. `pip install pyspark`\n2. use the `--distributor pyspark` option\n3. tweak the `--subjob_size 1000` option: this is the number of images to download in each subjob. increasing it will mean a longer time of preparation to put the feather files in the temporary dir, a shorter time will mean sending less shards at a time to the pyspark job.\n\nby default a local spark session will be created.\nyou may want to create a custom spark session depending on your specific spark cluster.\nto do that check [pyspark_example.py](examples/pyspark_example.py), there you can plug your custom code to create a spark session, then\nrun img2dataset which will use it for downloading.\n\nto create a spark cluster check the [distributed img2dataset tutorial](examples/distributed_img2dataset_tutorial.md)\n\n## integration with weights & biases\n\nto enable wandb, use the `--enable_wandb=true` option.\n\nperformance metrics are monitored through [weights & biases](https://wandb.com/).\n\n![w&b metrics](doc_assets/wandb_metrics.png)\n\nin addition, most frequent errors are logged for easier debugging.\n\n![w&b table](doc_assets/wandb_table.png)\n\nother features are available:\n\n* logging of environment configuration (os, python version, cpu count, hostname, etc)\n* monitoring of hardware resources (gpu/cpu, ram, disk, networking, etc)\n* custom graphs and reports\n* comparison of runs (convenient when optimizing parameters such as number of threads/cpus)\n\nwhen running the script for the first time, you can decide to either associate your metrics to your account or log them anonymously.\n\nyou can also log in (or create an account) before by running `wandb login`.\n\n## road map\n\nthis tool works very well in the current state for up to 100m elements. future goals include:\n\n* a benchmark for 1b pictures which may require\n  * further optimization on the resizing part\n  * better multi node support\n  * integrated support for incremental support (only download new elements)\n\n## architecture notes\n\nthis tool is designed to download pictures as fast as possible.\nthis put a stress on various kind of resources. some numbers assuming 1350 image/s:\n* bandwidth: downloading a thousand average image per second requires about 130mb/s\n* cpu: resizing one image may take several milliseconds, several thousand per second can use up to 16 cores\n* dns querying: million of urls mean million of domains, default os setting usually are not enough. setting up a local bind9 resolver may be required\n* disk: if using resizing, up to 30mb/s write speed is necessary. if not using resizing, up to 130mb/s. writing in few tar files make it possible to use rotational drives instead of a ssd.\n\nwith these information in mind, the design choice was done in this way:\n* the list of urls is split in k shards. k is chosen such that a shard has a reasonable size on disk (for example 256mb), by default k = 10000\n* n processes are started (using multiprocessing process pool)\n  * each process starts m threads. m should be maximized in order to use as much network as possible while keeping cpu usage below 100%.\n  * each of this thread download 1 image and returns it\n  * the parent thread handle resizing (which means there is at most n resizing running at once, using up the cores but not more)\n  * the parent thread saves to a tar file that is different from other process\n\nthis design make it possible to use the cpu resource efficiently by doing only 1 resize per core, reduce disk overhead by opening 1 file per core, while using the bandwidth resource as much as possible by using m thread per process.\n\nalso see [architecture.md](img2dataset/architecture.md) for the precise split in python modules.\n\n## setting up a high performance dns resolver\n\nto get the best performances with img2dataset, using an efficient dns resolver is needed.\n* knot resolver can run in parallel\n* bind resolver is the historic resolver and is mono core but very optimized\n\n\n### setting up a knot resolver\n\nfollow [the official quick start](https://knot-resolver.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart-install.html) or run this on ubuntu:\n\ninstall knot with\n\n```bash\nwget https://secure.nic.cz/files/knot-resolver/knot-resolver-release.deb\nsudo dpkg -i knot-resolver-release.deb\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y knot-resolver\nsudo sh -c 'echo `hostname -i` `hostname` >> /etc/hosts'\nsudo sh -c 'echo nameserver 127.0.0.1 > /etc/resolv.conf'\nsudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved\n```\n\nthen start 4 instances with\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start kresd@1.service\nsudo systemctl start kresd@2.service\nsudo systemctl start kresd@3.service\nsudo systemctl start kresd@4.service\n```\n\ncheck it works with\n\n```bash\ndig @localhost google.com\n```\n\n### setting up a bind9 resolver\n\nin order to keep the success rate high, it is necessary to use an efficient dns resolver.\ni tried several options: systemd-resolved, dnsmaskq and bind9 and reached the conclusion that bind9 reaches the best performance for this use case.\nhere is how to set this up on ubuntu. run:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install bind9\nsudo vim /etc/bind/named.conf.options\n```\n\nand add this in `options`:\n\n```\n\trecursive-clients 10000;\n\tresolver-query-timeout 30000;\n\tmax-clients-per-query 10000;\n\tmax-cache-size 2000m;\n```\n\nthen, run:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart bind9\necho nameserver 127.0.0.1 | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf\n```\n\nthis will make it possible to keep an high success rate while doing thousands of dns queries.\nyou may also want to [setup bind9 logging](https://nsrc.org/activities/agendas/en/dnssec-3-days/dns/materials/labs/en/dns-bind-logging.html) in order to check that few dns errors happen.\n\n\n## ai use impact\n\nimg2dataset is used to retrieve images from the web and make them easily available for ml use cases. use cases involve:\n* doing inference and indexing to better understand what is in the web (https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/ is an example of this)\n* training models\n\nmodels that can be trained using image/text datasets include:\n* clip: an image understanding model that allow for example to know whether an image is safe, aesthetic, what animal it contains, ...\n* text to image models: generating images based on text\n\nthere is a lot of discussions regarding the consequences of text to image models. some opinions include:\n* ai art is democratizing art and letting hundred of millions of people express themselves through art. making art much more prevalent and unique\n* ai models should not be trained on images that creator do not want to share\n\nthe opt out directive try to let creators that do not want to share their art not be used for indexing and for training.\n\n\n## for development\n\neither locally, or in [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) (do `export pip_user=false` there)\n\nsetup a virtualenv:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m venv .env\nsource .env/bin/activate\npip install -e .\n```\n\nto run tests:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements-test.txt\n```\nthen\n\n```bash\nmake lint\nmake test\n```\n\nyou can use `make black` to reformat the code\n\n`python -m pytest -x -s -v tests -k \"dummy\"` to run a specific test\n\n## benchmarks\n\n### 10000 image benchmark\n\n```bash\ncd tests/test_files\nbash benchmark.sh\n```\n\n\n### 18m image benchmark\n\ndownload crawling at home first part, then:\n\n```bash\ncd tests\nbash large_bench.sh\n```\n\nit takes 3.7h to download 18m
