  "description": "introduction\n============\n\nthis package will allow you to get zip code information. the data used in this\npackage can be retrieved from\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20101126192032/http://pablotron.org/files/zipcodes-csv-10-aug-2004.zip\n\n`pyzipcode` uses a local sqlite database to run. you can replace it with your\nown other storage mechanism with a little effort.\n\nhere is some basic usage...\n\n```pycon\n>>> from pyzipcode import zipcodedatabase\n>>> zcdb = zipcodedatabase()\n\n>>> zcdb[54115]\nzipcode(zip='54115', city='de pere', state='wi', longitude=-88.07896, latitude=44.42042, timezone=-6, dst=1)\n>>> zcdb[210]\nzipcode(zip='00210', city='portsmouth', state='nh', longitude=-71.013202, latitude=43.005895, timezone=-5, dst=1)\n```\n\nsearch zip codes...\n\n```pycon\n>>> from pyzipcode import zipcodedatabase\n>>> zcdb = zipcodedatabase()\n>>> len(zcdb.find_zip(city=\"oshkosh\"))\n7\n>>> len(zcdb.find_zip(city=\"o%\"))  # all cities starting with \"o\" using sql wildcard\n60\n>>> len(zcdb.find_zip(city=\"doesn't exist\"))  # returns none\n>>> \n```\n\nget a list of zipcodes around a radius of a zipcode (this actually searches a square area)\n\n```pycon\n>>> from pyzipcode import zipcodedatabase\n>>> zcdb = zipcodedatabase()\n>>> [z.zip for z in zcdb.get_zipcodes_around_radius('54901', 10)]\n['54901', '54902', '54903', '54904', '54906', '54927', '54952', '54956', '54957', '54979', '54985']\n```\n\nthe data\n========\n\nthe following is the original readme file from `zipcodes-csv-10-aug-2004.zip`:\n\n```text\ncivicspace us zip code database\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nwritten by schuyler erle <schuyler@geocoder.us>\n5 august 2004\n\ncorrected total count and removed sql table definition\nneil drumm <neil@civicspacelabs.org>\n10 august 2004\n\nthe zip code database contained in 'zipcode.csv' contains 43191 zip\ncodes for the continetal united states, alaska, hawaii, puerto rico,\nand american samoa. the database is in comma separated value format,\nwith columns for zip code, city, state, latitude, longitude, timezone\n(offset from gmt), and daylight savings time flag (1 if dst is observed\nin this zip code and 0 if not).\n\nthis database was composed using zip code gazetteers from the us census\nbureau from 1999 and 2000, augmented with additional zip code information\nfrom the census bureau's tiger/line 2003 data set. timezone information\nwas added using cartographic data sets from nationalatlas.gov. the\ndatabase is guaranteed to exclusively contain information gathered from\nsources in the public domain, and thus be legal to redistribute.\n\nthe database is believed to contain over 98% of the zip codes in current\nuse in the united states. the remaining zip codes absent from this\ndatabase are entirely po box or firm zip codes added in the last five\nyears, which are no longer published by the census bureau, but in any\nevent serve a very small minority of the population (probably on the\norder of .1% or less). although every attempt has been made to filter\nthem out, this data set may contain up to .5% false positives, that is,\nzip codes that do not exist or are no longer in use but are included due\nto erroneous data sources. the latitude and longitude given for each zip\ncode is typically (though not always) the geographic centroid of the zip\ncode; in any event, the location given can generally be expected to lie\nsomewhere within the zip code's \"boundaries\".\n\nthe database andthis readme are copyright 2004 civicspace labs, inc.,\nand are published under a creative commons attribution-sharealike\nlicense, which requires that all updates must be released under the same\nlicense. see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/ for more\ndetails. please contact schuyler@geocoder.us if you are interested in\nreceiving updates to this database as they become available.\n\n-=- 30 -=-\n\nvisit http://civicspacelabs.org/zipcodedb for latest information.\n```\n\n\n\n# changelog\n\n3.0.1 (2021-03-03)\n\n- fix release\n\n## 3.0.0 (2021-03-03)\n\n- zipcodedatabase objects now behave like dictionaries\n  - looking up a non-existent zipcode raises a keyerror instead of indexerror\n  - .get() now returns a zipcode object instead of a list containing 1 zipcode object\n  - they now have a len(), can be iterated over and reversed()\n  - they now have .keys() .values() and .items() methods\n- zipcode objects are created by passing multiple arguments, one for\n  each value, instead of a tuple\n- support looking up 4 and 3 digit zip codes as integers\n- drop python 2 support\n\n  2.0.3 (unreleased)\n\n---\n\n- nothing changed yet.\n\n## 2.0.2 (2021-02-28)\n\n- license update\n\n## 2.0.1 (2021-02-25)\n\n- fix error message for unknown zip code[mpcusack]\n\n## 2.0.0 (2020-04-07)\n\n- updated to work with py3\n  [david schneider]\n\n  1.0 (2016-01-20)\n\n---\n\n- fix import code so that it is not run when the module is imported (for\n  example, when building sphinx api documentation).\n- rename the import.py module to import_zipcode.py because `import` is a\n  reserved python keyword.\n- document the import_zipcode module.\n\n  0.4\n\n---\n\n- updated to use maxmind database http://www.maxmind.com/app/postalcode\n\n- now also keeps timezone and dst values\n\n- longitude and latitude is now contains negative numbers\n\n## 0.3\n\n- use strings instead of integer for storing zip codes since zip codes can start\n  with a zero.\n\n## 0.2\n\n- catch sqlite db file reading errors and keep trying in case\n  another process is trying to access the file at the same time.\n\n## 0.1\n\n- initial release",
