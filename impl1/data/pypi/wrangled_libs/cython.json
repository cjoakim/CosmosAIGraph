  "description": "the cython language makes writing c extensions for the python language as\neasy as python itself.  cython is a source code translator based on pyrex_,\nbut supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.\n\nthe cython language is a superset of the python language (almost all python\ncode is also valid cython code), but cython additionally supports optional\nstatic typing to natively call c functions, operate with c++ classes and\ndeclare fast c types on variables and class attributes.  this allows the\ncompiler to generate very efficient c code from cython code.\n\nthis makes cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external\nc/c++ libraries, and for fast c modules that speed up the execution of\npython code.\n\nnote that for one-time builds, e.g. for ci/testing, on platforms that are not\ncovered by one of the wheel packages provided on pypi *and* the pure python wheel\nthat we provide is not used, it is substantially faster than a full source build\nto install an uncompiled (slower) version of cython with::\n\n    pip install cython --install-option=\"--no-cython-compile\"\n\n.. _pyrex: https://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/pyrex/\n",
