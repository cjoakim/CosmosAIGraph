implements\n``collections.abc.mutablesequence``. the list is *mutable* until ``frozenlist.freeze``\nis called, after which list modifications raise ``runtimeerror``:\n\n\n>>> from frozenlist import frozenlist\n>>> fl = frozenlist([17, 42])\n>>> fl.append('spam')\n>>> fl.append('vikings')\n>>> fl\n<frozenlist(frozen=false, [17, 42, 'spam', 'vikings'])>\n>>> fl.freeze()\n>>> fl\n<frozenlist(frozen=true, [17, 42, 'spam', 'vikings'])>\n>>> fl.frozen\ntrue\n>>> fl.append(\"monty\")\ntraceback (most recent call last):\n  file \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  file \"frozenlist/_frozenlist.pyx\", line 97, in frozenlist._frozenlist.frozenlist.append\n    self._check_frozen()\n  file \"frozenlist/_frozenlist.pyx\", line 19, in frozenlist._frozenlist.frozenlist._check_frozen\n    raise runtimeerror(\"cannot modify frozen list.\")\nruntimeerror: cannot modify frozen list.\n\n\nfrozenlist is also hashable, but only when frozen. otherwise it also throws a runtimeerror:\n\n\n>>> fl = frozenlist([17, 42, 'spam'])\n>>> hash(fl)\ntraceback (most recent call last):\n  file \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  file \"frozenlist/_frozenlist.pyx\", line 111, in frozenlist._frozenlist.frozenlist.__hash__\n    raise runtimeerror(\"cannot hash unfrozen list.\")\nruntimeerror: cannot hash unfrozen list.\n>>> fl.freeze()\n>>> hash(fl)\n3713081631934410656\n>>> dictionary = {fl: 'vikings'} # frozen fl can be a dict key\n>>> dictionary\n{<frozenlist(frozen=true, [1, 2])>: 'vikings'}\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n   $ pip install frozenlist\n\nthe library requires python 3.8 or newer.\n\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nhttps://frozenlist.aio-libs.org\n\ncommunication channels\n----------------------\n\nwe have a *matrix space* `#aio-libs-space:matrix.org\n<https://matrix.to/#/%23aio-libs-space:matrix.org>`_ which is\nalso accessible via gitter.\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\n- python >= 3.8\n\nlicense\n-------\n\n``frozenlist`` is offered under the apache 2 license.\n\nsource code\n-----------\n\nthe project is hosted on github_\n\nplease file an issue in the `bug tracker\n<https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues>`_ if you have found a bug\nor have some suggestions to improve the library.\n\n.. _github: https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist\n\n=========\nchangelog\n=========\n\n..\n    you should *not* be adding new change log entries to this file, this\n    file is managed by towncrier. you *may* edit previous change logs to\n    fix problems like typo corrections or such.\n    to add a new change log entry, please see\n    https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/contributing/#news-entries\n    we named the news folder \"changes\".\n\n    warning: don't drop the next directive!\n\n.. towncrier release notes start\n\n1.4.1 (2023-12-15)\n==================\n\npackaging updates and notes for downstreams\n-------------------------------------------\n\n- declared python 3.12 and pypy 3.8-3.10 supported officially\n  in the distribution package metadata.\n\n\n  *related issues and pull requests on github:*\n  `#553 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/553>`__.\n\n- replaced the packaging is replaced from an old-fashioned ``setup.py`` to an\n  in-tree `pep 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ build backend -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  whenever the end-users or downstream packagers need to build ``frozenlist``\n  from source (a git checkout or an sdist), they may pass a ``config_settings``\n  flag ``pure-python``. if this flag is not set, a c-extension will be built\n  and included into the distribution.\n\n  here is how this can be done with ``pip``:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python3 -m pip install . --config-settings=pure-python=\n\n  this will also work with ``-e | --editable``.\n\n  the same can be achieved via ``pypa/build``:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python3 -m build --config-setting=pure-python=\n\n  adding ``-w | --wheel`` can force ``pypa/build`` produce a wheel from source\n  directly, as opposed to building an ``sdist`` and then building from it.\n\n\n  *related issues and pull requests on github:*\n  `#560 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/560>`__.\n\n\ncontributor-facing changes\n--------------------------\n\n- it is now possible to request line tracing in cython builds using the\n  ``with-cython-tracing`` `pep 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ config setting\n  -- `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  this can be used in ci and development environment to measure coverage\n  on cython modules, but is not normally useful to the end-users or\n  downstream packagers.\n\n  here's a usage example:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python3 -im pip install . --config-settings=with-cython-tracing=true\n\n  for editable installs, this setting is on by default. otherwise, it's\n  off unless requested explicitly.\n\n  the following produces c-files required for the cython coverage\n  plugin to map the measurements back to the pyx-files:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python -im pip install -e .\n\n  alternatively, the ``frozenlist_cython_tracing=1`` environment variable\n  can be set to do the same as the `pep 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ config setting.\n\n\n  *related issues and pull requests on github:*\n  `#560 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/560>`__.\n\n- coverage collection has been implemented for the cython modules\n  -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  it will also be reported to codecov from any non-release ci jobs.\n\n\n  *related issues and pull requests on github:*\n  `#561 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/561>`__.\n\n- a step-by-step ``release guide`` guide has\n  been added, describing how to release *frozenlist* -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  this is primarily targeting the maintainers.\n\n\n  *related issues and pull requests on github:*\n  `#563 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/563>`__.\n\n- detailed ``contributing guidelines`` on\n  authoring the changelog fragments have been published in the\n  documentation -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n\n  *related issues and pull requests on github:*\n  `#564 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/564>`__.\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.4.0
