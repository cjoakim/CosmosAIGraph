  "description": "# ypy-websocket\n\nypy-websocket is an async websocket connector for ypy.\n\n[![build status](https://github.com/y-crdt/ypy-websocket/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/y-crdt/ypy-websocket/actions)\n[![code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n\n---\n\n**documentation**: <a href=\"https://davidbrochart.github.io/ypy-websocket\" target=\"_blank\">https://davidbrochart.github.io/ypy-websocket</a>\n\n**source code**: <a href=\"https://github.com/y-crdt/ypy-websocket\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/y-crdt/ypy-websocket</a>\n\n---\n\nypy-websocket is a python library for building websocket servers and clients that connect and synchronize shared documents.\nit can be used to create collaborative web applications.\n\nthe following diagram illustrates a typical architecture. the goal is to share a document among several clients.\n\neach client has an instance of a [ydoc](https://ypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/y_py/index.html#y_py.ydoc), representing their view of a document. a shared document also lives in a [room](./reference/room.md) on the server side. conceptually, a room can be seen as the place where clients collaborate on a document. the websocket to which a client connects points to the corresponding room through the endpoint path. in the example below, clients a and b connect to a websocket at path `room-1`, and thus both clients find themselves in a room called `room-1`. all the `ydoc` synchronization logic is taken care of by the [websocketprovider](./reference/websocket_provider.md).\n\neach update to a shared document can be persisted to disk using a [store](./reference/store.md), which can be a file or a database.\n```mermaid\nflowchart td\n    classdef room1 fill:#f96\n    classdef room2 fill:#bbf\n    a[client a<br>room-1]:::room1 <-->|websocket<br>provider| server(websocket server)\n    b[client b<br>room-1]:::room1 <-->|websocket<br>provider| server\n    c[client c<br>room-2]:::room2 <-->|websocket<br>provider| server\n    d[client d<br>room-2]:::room2 <-->|websocket<br>provider| server\n    server <--> room1((room-1<br>clients: a, b)):::room1\n    server <--> room2((room-2<br>clients: c, d)):::room2\n    a <-..-> room1\n    b <-..-> room1\n    c <-..-> room2\n    d <-..-> room2\n    room1 ---> store1[(store)]\n    room2 ---> store2[(store)]\n```\n",
