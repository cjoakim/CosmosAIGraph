  "description": "pycryptodome\n============\n\npycryptodome is a self-contained python package of low-level\ncryptographic primitives.\n\nit supports python 2.7, python 3.5 and newer, and pypy.\n\nyou can install it with::\n\n    pip install pycryptodomex\n\nall modules are installed under the ``cryptodome`` package.\n\ncheck the pycryptodome_ project for the equivalent library that\nworks under the ``crypto`` package.\n\npycryptodome is a fork of pycrypto. it brings several enhancements\nwith respect to the last official version of pycrypto (2.6.1),\nfor instance:\n\n* authenticated encryption modes (gcm, ccm, eax, siv, ocb)\n* accelerated aes on intel platforms via aes-ni\n* first class support for pypy\n* elliptic curves cryptography (nist p-curves; ed25519, ed448)\n* better and more compact api (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,\n  automatic generation of random nonces and ivs, simplified ctr cipher mode,\n  and more)\n* sha-3 (including shake xofs) and blake2 hash algorithms\n* salsa20 and chacha20 stream ciphers\n* scrypt and hkdf\n* deterministic (ec)dsa and eddsa\n* password-protected pkcs#8 key containers\n* shamir's secret sharing scheme\n* random numbers get sourced directly from the os (and not from a csprng in userspace)\n* simplified install process, including better support for windows\n* cleaner rsa and dsa key generation (largely based on fips 186-4)\n* major clean ups and simplification of the code base\n\npycryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate c library like *openssl*.\nto the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure python.\nonly the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)\nare implemented as c extensions.\n\nfor more information, see the `homepage`_.\n\nall the code can be downloaded from `github`_.\n\n.. _pycryptodome: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycryptodome\n.. _`homepage`: http://www.pycryptodome.org\n.. _github: https://github.com/legrandin/pycryptodome\n\n\n",
