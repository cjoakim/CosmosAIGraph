libraries\r\n\r\n[![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python%20-3.8%7c3.9-blue)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx-bsl)\r\n[![pypi](https://badge.fury.io/py/tfx-bsl.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tfx-bsl)\r\n\r\ntfx basic shared libraries (`tfx_bsl`) contains libraries shared by many\r\n[tensorflow extended (tfx)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) components.\r\n\r\n__only symbols exported by sub-modules under `tfx_bsl/public` are intended for\r\ndirect use by tfx users__, including by standalone tfx library (e.g. tfdv, tfma,\r\ntft) users, tfx pipeline authors and tfx component authors. those apis will\r\nbecome stable and follow semantic versioning once `tfx_bsl` goes beyond `1.0`.\r\n\r\napis under other directories should be considered internal to tfx\r\n(and therefore there is no backward or forward compatibility guarantee for\r\nthem).\r\n\r\neach minor version of a tfx library or tfx itself, if it needs to\r\ndepend on `tfx_bsl`, will depend on a specific minor version of it (e.g.\r\n`tensorflow_data_validation` 0.14.\\* will depend on, and only work with,\r\n`tfx_bsl` 0.14.\\*)\r\n\r\n## installing from pypi\r\n\r\n`tfx_bsl` is available as a [pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/tfx-bsl/).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install tfx-bsl\r\n```\r\n\r\n### nightly packages\r\n\r\ntfx-bsl also hosts nightly packages at https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org on\r\ngoogle cloud. to install the latest nightly package, please use the following\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install --extra-index-url https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org/simple tfx-bsl\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis will install the nightly packages for the major dependencies of tfx-bsl\r\nsuch as tensorflow metadata (tfmd).\r\n\r\nhowever it is a dependency of many tfx components and usually as a user you\r\ndon't need to install it directly.\r\n\r\n## build with docker\r\n\r\nif you want to build a tfx component from the master branch, past the latest\r\nrelease, you may also have to build the latest `tfx_bsl`, as that tfx component\r\nmight have depended on new features introduced past the latest `tfx_bsl`\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nbuilding from docker is the recommended way to build `tfx_bsl` under linux,\r\nand is continuously tested at google.\r\n\r\n### 1. install docker\r\n\r\nplease first install [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and\r\n[`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) by following the\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n### 2. clone the `tfx_bsl` repository\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx-bsl\r\ncd tfx-bsl\r\n```\r\n\r\nnote that these instructions will install the latest master branch of `tfx-bsl`.\r\nif you want to install a specific branch (such as a release branch), pass\r\n`-b <branchname>` to the `git clone` command.\r\n\r\n### 3. build the pip package\r\n\r\nthen, run the following at the project root:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo docker-compose build manylinux2010\r\nsudo docker-compose run -e python_version=${python_version} manylinux2010\r\n```\r\nwhere `python_version` is one of `{38, 39}`.\r\n\r\na wheel will be produced under `dist/`.\r\n\r\n### 4. install the pip package\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npip install dist/*.whl\r\n```\r\n\r\n## build from source\r\n\r\n### 1. prerequisites\r\n\r\n#### install numpy\r\n\r\nif numpy is not installed on your system, install it now by following [these\r\ndirections](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html).\r\n\r\n#### install bazel\r\n\r\nif bazel is not installed on your system, install it now by following [these\r\ndirections](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. clone the `tfx_bsl` repository\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx-bsl\r\ncd tfx-bsl\r\n```\r\n\r\nnote that these instructions will install the latest master branch of `tfx_bsl`\r\nif you want to install a specific branch (such as a release branch),\r\npass `-b <branchname>` to the `git clone` command.\r\n\r\n### 3. build the pip package\r\n\r\n`tfx_bsl` wheel is python version dependent -- to build the pip package that\r\nworks for a specific python version, use that python binary to run:\r\n```shell\r\npython setup.py bdist_wheel\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can find the generated `.whl` file in the `dist` subdirectory.\r\n\r\n### 4. install the pip package\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npip install dist/*.whl\r\n```\r\n\r\n## supported platforms\r\n\r\n`tfx_bsl` is tested on the following 64-bit operating systems:\r\n\r\n  * macos 10.12.6 (sierra) or later.\r\n  * ubuntu 20.04 or later.\r\n  * windows 7 or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n## compatible versions\r\n\r\nthe following table is the `tfx_bsl` package versions that are compatible with\r\neach other. this is determined by our testing framework, but other *untested*\r\ncombinations may also work.\r\n\r\ntfx-bsl
