  "description": "# tianocore edk2 pytool library (edk2toollib)\r\n\r\n[![pypi]][_pypi]\r\n[![codecov]][_codecov]\r\n[![ci]][_ci]\r\n[![docs]][_docs]\r\n\r\nthis is a tianocore maintained project consisting of a python library supporting\r\nuefi firmware development.  this package's intent is to provide an easy way to\r\norganize and share python code to facilitate reuse across environments, tools,\r\nand scripts.  inclusion of this package and dependency management is best\r\nmanaged using pip/pypi.\r\n\r\nthis is a supplemental package and is not required to be used for edk2 builds.\r\n\r\n## current status\r\n\r\n[![codecov]][_codecov]\r\n[![ci]][_ci]\r\n\r\nthe code coverage and ci badges represent unit test status and the code coverage\r\nof those unit tests. we require 100% unit test success (hence the pass / fail)\r\nand that code coverage percentage does not lower.\r\n\r\nsupported versions\r\n\r\n|  host type         |  toolchain    |  status\r\n|  :---------------  |  :----------  |  :--------------------  |\r\n|  [windows-latest]  |  python 3.10  |  [![ci]][_ci]           |\r\n|  [windows-latest]  |  python 3.11  |  [![ci]][_ci]

github\r\n [tags](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/tags),\r\n [releases](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/releases) and\r\n [milestones](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/milestones).\r\n\r\n## content\r\n\r\nthe package contains classes and modules that can be used as the building blocks\r\nof tools that are relevant to uefi firmware developers.  these modules should\r\nattempt to provide generic support and avoid tightly coupling with specific use\r\ncases.  it is expected these modules do not provide direct interaction with the\r\nuser (through command line interfaces) but instead are intended to be wrapped in\r\nother scripts/tools which contains the specific usage and interface.\r\n\r\nexamples:\r\n\r\n* file parsers for edk2 specific file types.  these parse the file and provide\r\n  an object for interacting with the content.\r\n* uefi specific services for encoding/decoding binary structures.\r\n* uefi defined values and interfaces for usage in python\r\n* python wrappers for other system cli tools ( signtool, catalog file\r\n  generation, inf file generation, etc)\r\n* python utilities to provide consistent logging, command invocation, path\r\n  resolution, etc\r\n\r\n## license\r\n\r\nall content in this repository is licensed under [bsd-2-clause plus patent\r\nlicense](license.txt).\r\n\r\n[![pypi -\r\nlicense](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/edk2_pytool_library.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/edk2-pytool-library/)\r\n\r\n## usage\r\n\r\nnote: it is strongly recommended that you use python virtual environments.\r\nvirtual environments avoid changing the global python workspace and causing\r\nconflicting dependencies.  virtual environments are lightweight and easy to use.\r\n[learn more](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)\r\n\r\n* to install run `pip install --upgrade edk2-pytool-library`\r\n* to use in your python code\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from edk2toollib.<module> import <class>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## history\r\n\r\nthis library and functionality was ported from project mu. for history and\r\ndocumentation prior to this see the original project mu project\r\n<https://github.com/microsoft/mu_pip_python_library>\r\n\r\n## contribution process\r\n\r\nthis project welcomes all types of contributions. for issues, bugs, and\r\nquestions it is best to open a [github\r\nissue](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/issues).\r\n\r\n### code contributions\r\n\r\nfor code contributions this project leverages github pull requests.  see github\r\ntutorials, help, and documentation for complete descriptions. for best success\r\nplease follow the below process.\r\n\r\n1. contributor opens an issue describing problem or new desired functionality\r\n2. contributor forks repository in github\r\n3. contributor creates branch for work in their fork\r\n4. contributor makes code changes, writes relevant unit tests, authors\r\n   documentation and release notes as necessary.\r\n5. contributor runs tests locally\r\n6. contributor submits pr to master branch of tianocore/edk2-pytool-library\r\n    1. pr reviewers will provide feedback on change.  if any modifications are\r\n       required, contributor will make changes and push updates.\r\n    2. pr automation will run and validate tests pass\r\n    3. if all comments resolved, maintainers approved, and tests pass the pr\r\n       will be squash merged and closed by the maintainers.\r\n\r\n## maintainers\r\n\r\nsee the [github\r\nteam](https://github.com/orgs/tianocore/teams/edk-ii-tool-maintainers) for more\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n## documentation\r\n\r\n[![docs]][_docs]\r\n\r\n### users and consumers\r\n\r\ndocumentation for the most recent release of edk2-pytool-library is hosted on\r\n[tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-library](https://www.tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-library/).\r\nraw documentation is located in the ```docs/``` folder and is split into two\r\nseparate categories. the first is located at ```docs/user/``` and is\r\ndocumentation and api references for those that are using this package in their\r\nown project. users can generate a local copy of the documentation by executing the\r\nfollowing command from the root of the project:\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\npip install --upgrade -e .[docs]\r\nmkdocs serve\r\n```\r\n\r\n### contributors\r\n\r\ncontributor documentation is located at ```docs/contributor/``` and contains instructions for:\r\n\r\n* setting up a development and testing environment\r\n* how edk2pytools is versioned and published\r\n* contributing to the edk2-pytool-extensions repository\r\n\r\n[codecov]:
