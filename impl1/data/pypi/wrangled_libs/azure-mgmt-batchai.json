  "description": "microsoft azure sdk for python\n==============================\n\nthis is the microsoft azure batch ai management client library.\n\nazure resource manager (arm) is the next generation of management apis that\nreplace the old azure service management (asm).\n\nthis package has been tested with python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.\n\nfor the older azure service management (asm) libraries, see\n`azure-servicemanagement-legacy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy>`__ library.\n\nfor a more complete set of azure libraries, see the `azure <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure>`__ bundle package.\n\n\ncompatibility\n=============\n\n**important**: if you have an earlier version of the azure package\n(version < 1.0), you should uninstall it before installing this package.\n\nyou can check the version using pip:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    pip freeze\n\nif you see azure==0.11.0 (or any version below 1.0), uninstall it first:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    pip uninstall azure\n\n\nusage\n=====\n\nfor code examples, see `batch ai management\n<https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/batchai>`__\non docs.microsoft.com.\n\n\nprovide feedback\n================\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the\n`issues <https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues>`__\nsection of the project.\n\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nrelease history\n===============\n\n2.0.0 (2018-06-07)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses 2018-05-01 batchai api specification which introduced the following braking changes:\n\n- clusters, fileservers must be created under a workspace;\n- jobs must be created under an experiment;\n- clusters, fileservers and jobs do not accept location during creation and belong to the same location as the parent\n  workspace;\n- clusters, fileservers and jobs do not support tags;\n- batchaimanagementclient.usage renamed to batchaimanagementclient.usages;\n- job priority changed a type from int to an enum;\n- file.is_directory is replaced with file.file_type;\n- job.priority and jobcreateparameters.priority is replaced with scheduling_priority;\n- removed unsupported mountsettings.file_server_type attribute;\n- outputdirectory.type unsupported attribute removed;\n- outputdirectory.create_new attributes removed, batchai will always create output directories if they not exist;\n- setuptask.run_elevated attribute removed, the setup task is always executed under root.\n\n**features**\n\n- added support to workspaces to group clusters, fileservers and experiments and remove limit on number of allocated\n  resources;\n- added support for experiment to group jobs and remove limit on number of jobs;\n- added support for configuring /dev/shm for jobs which use docker containers;\n- added first class support for generic mpi jobs;\n- added first class support for horovod jobs.\n\n1.0.1 (2018-04-16)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n- fix some invalid models in python 3\n- compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0\n\n1.0.0 (2018-03-19)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.\n\n- model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. all positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.\n  to keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for python 2 and python 3. python 3 uses the \"*\" syntax for keyword-only arguments.\n- enum types now use the \"str\" mixin (class azureenum(str, enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.\n  while this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:\n  https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others\n  at a glance:\n\n  - \"is\" should not be used at all.\n  - \"format\" will return the string value, where \"%s\" string formatting will return `nameofenum.stringvalue`. format syntax should be prefered.\n\n- new long running operation:\n\n  - return type changes from `msrestazure.azure_operation.azureoperationpoller` to `msrest.polling.lropoller`. external api is the same.\n  - return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.lropoller`, regardless of the optional parameters used.\n  - the behavior has changed when using `raw=true`. instead of returning the initial call result as `clientrawresponse`, \n    without polling, now this returns an lropoller. after polling, the final resource will be returned as a `clientrawresponse`.\n  - new `polling` parameter. the default behavior is `polling=true` which will poll using arm algorithm. when `polling=false`,\n    the response of the initial call will be returned without polling.\n  - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of `msrest.polling.pollingmethod`.\n  - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right away.\n\n**features**\n\n- added support for job level mounting\n- added support for environment variables with secret values\n- added support for performance counters reporting in azure application insights\n- added support for custom images\n- added support for pytorch deep learning framework\n- added api for usage and limits reporting\n- added api for listing job files in subdirectories\n- now user can choose caching type during nfs creation\n- get cluster now reports a path segment generated for storing start task output logs\n- get job now reports a path segment generated for job's output directories\n- renamed environmentsetting to environmentvariable\n\n0.2.0 (2017-10-05)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n* credentials_info property got renamed to credentials.\n* removed unused class fileserverstatus and code enum\n* renamed enums for cachingtype and vmpriority\n* removed 'statuses' attribute on fileserver\n\n0.1.0 (2017-10-03)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n* initial release\n\n\n",
