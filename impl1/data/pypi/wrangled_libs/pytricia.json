  "description": "\npytricia is a python module to store ip prefixes in a\npatricia tree. it's based on dave plonka's modified patricia tree\ncode, and has three things to recommend it over related modules\n(including py-radix and subnettree):\n\n * it's faster,\n\n * it works nicely in python 3, and\n\n * there are a few nicer library features for manipulating the structure.\n\nsee the github repo for documentation and some performance numbers: <https://github.com/jsommers/pytricia>.\n\npytricia is released under terms of the gnu lesser general public license,\nversion 3.\n\n\n",
