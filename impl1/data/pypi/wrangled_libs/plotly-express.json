  "description": "# plotly express\n\nplotly express is now part of plotly.py version 4 and so the `plotly_express` module now just re-exports the contents of `plotly.express`\n\n## installation\n\nif you follow the [`plotly` getting started](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/) instructions for installation, you will get access to `plotly.express`.\n\nhowever, if you have existing code that imports from `plotly_express` explicitly and you don't wish to change it, you can still install the latest version, which just exposes `plotly.express` under the `plotly_express` namespace.\n\n### via `pip`\n\njust running `pip install plotly_express==0.4.0` in your terminal should do it!\n\n### via `conda`\n\nyou'll have to install from the `plotly` channel with `conda install -c plotly plotly_express==0.4.0`\n\n## getting help\n\nplease join our [community forum](https://community.plot.ly/c/api/python) or file a [github issue](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/new) if you've found a bug.\n\n\n",
