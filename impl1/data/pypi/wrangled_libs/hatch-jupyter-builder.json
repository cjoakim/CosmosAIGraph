  "description": "# hatch-jupyter-builder\n\n[![pypi - version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hatch-jupyter-builder.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/hatch-jupyter-builder)\n[![hatch project](https://img.shields.io/badge/%f0%9f%a5%9a-hatch-4051b5.svg)](https://github.com/pypa/hatch)\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nthis provides a [build hook](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#build-hooks) plugin for [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) that adds a build step for use with jupyter packages.\n\n**table of contents**\n\n- [documentation](#documentation)\n- [installation](#installation)\n- [license](#license)\n- [usage and configuration](#usage_and_configuration)\n- [local development](#local_development)\n\n## documentation\n\nthe full documenation is available on [read the docs](https://hatch-jupyter-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## installation\n\n```console\npip install hatch-jupyter-builder\n```\n\n## local development\n\nto test this package locally with another package, use the following:\n\n```toml\n[tool.hatch.build.hooks.jupyter-builder]\ndependencies = [\"hatch-jupyter-builder@file://<path_to_this_repo>\"]\n```\n\n## skipping the build\n\nyou can skip the build by setting the `skip_jupyter_builder` environment\nvariable.\n\n## migration\n\nthis library can be used to migrate from a `setuptools` based package to\nuse `hatch_jupyter_builder`. it will attempt to migrate `jupyter-packaging`\nconfig as well, if present.\n\nto migrate, run the following:\n\n```bash\npython -m hatch_jupyter_builder.migrate .\n```\n\nthe migration script will do most of the migration automatically, but\nwill prompt you for anything it cannot do itself.\n\nto compare dist files with a reference checkout, run the following:\n\n```bash\npython -m hatch_jupyter_builder.compare_migration <source_dir> <target_dir> sdist\n```\n\nthe migration scripts can also be used without installation, using `pipx`, e.g.:\n\n```bash\npipx hatch_jupyter_builder migrate .\n```\n\nuse `wheel` to compare wheel file contents.\n\nsee the [documentation for more information on migration](https://hatch-jupyter-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/how_to_guides/index.html) for more details.\n\n## license\n\n`hatch-jupyter-builder` is distributed under the terms of the [mit](https://spdx.org/licenses/mit.html) license.\n",
