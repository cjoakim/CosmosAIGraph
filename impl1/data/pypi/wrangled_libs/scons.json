can keep multiple jobs running\n      simultaneously regardless of directory hierarchy.\n    * integrated autoconf-like support for finding #include files, libraries,\n      functions and typedefs.\n    * global view of all dependencies - no more multiple build passes or\n      reordering targets to build everything.\n    * ability to share built files in a cache to speed up multiple builds.\n    * designed from the ground up for cross-platform builds, and known to\n      work on linux, other posix systems (including aix, bsd systems,\n      hp/ux, irix and solaris), windows 7/8/10, macos, and os/2.\n    * written in python.\n\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\ndocumentation for scons is available at\nhttp://www.scons.org/documentation.html.\n\n\nexecution requirements\n======================\n\nrunning scons requires python 3.6 or higher. there should be no other\ndependencies or requirements to run standard scons.\nthe last release to support python 3.5 was 4.2.0.\n\nsome experimental features may require additional python packages\nto be installed - at the moment the ninja feature requires the\nsupporting `ninja package <https://pypi.org/project/ninja/>`_.\n\nthe default scons configuration assumes use of the microsoft visual c++\ncompiler suite on win32 systems, and assumes a c compiler named ``cc``, a c++\ncompiler named ``c++``, and a fortran compiler named ``gfortran`` (such as found\nin the gnu compiler collection) on any other type of system.  you may\noverride these default values by appropriate configuration of variables\nin a construction environment, or in the case of cygwin on a win32 system,\nby selecting the 'cygwin' platform, which will set some of those construction\nvariables for you.\n\nby default, scons knows how to search for available programming tools on\nvarious systems - see the\n`scons man page <https://scons.org/doc/production/html/scons-man.html>`_\nfor details.  you can override\nthe default scons choices made by appropriate configuration of\nconstruction variables.\n\n\ninstallation requirements\n=========================\n\nscons has no installation dependencies beyond a compatible version\nof python. the tools which will be used to to actually construct the\nproject, such as compilers, documentation production tools, etc.\nshould of course be installed by the appropriate means.\n\n\ngetting started using scons\n===========================\n\nif you're new to scons, the first couple of chapters of the\n`scons user guide <https://scons.org/doc/production/html/scons-user.html>`_\nprovide an excellent starting spot.\n\n\ncontributing to scons\n=====================\n\nplease see `contributing <https://github.com/scons/scons/contributing.rst>`_.\n\n\nlicense\n=======\n\nscons is distributed under the mit license, a full copy of which is available\nin the license file.\n\n\nreporting bugs\n==============\n\nthe scons project welcomes bug reports and feature requests.\n\nplease make sure you send email with the problem or feature request to\nthe scons users mailing list, which you can join at\nhttps://two.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/scons-users,\nor on the scons discord server in\n`#scons-help <https://discord.gg/bxvpway#scons-help>`_.\n\nonce you have discussed your issue on the users mailing list and the\ncommunity has confirmed that it is either a new bug or a duplicate of an\nexisting bug, then please follow the instructions the community provides\nto file a new bug or to add yourself to the cc list for an existing bug\n\nyou can explore the list of existing bugs, which may include workarounds\nfor the problem you've run into, on the\n`github issue tracker <https://github.com/scons/scons/issues>`_.\n\n\nmailing lists\n=============\n\nin addition to the scons-users list which is appropriate for almost any\nquestion, there is a mailing list specifically for developers of scons\nyou may send questions or comments to the list at:\n\nyou may subscribe to the developer's mailing list using the form at\nhttps://two.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/scons-dev.\n\nsubscription to the developer's mailing list is by approval.  in practice, no\none is refused list membership, but we reserve the right to limit membership\nin the future and/or weed out lurkers.\n\nnote that while this list still exists, the number of different places you\ncan talk about scons means it is no longer very active.  github has\nsupport for discussions as well as for issues, and there is usually more\nimmediacy on the discord chat, so these are probably now considered the\npreferred places for \"development\" topics.\n\n\ndonations\n=========\n\nif you find scons helpful, please consider making a donation (of cash,\nsoftware, or hardware) to support continued work on the project.  information\nis available at https://www.scons.org/donate.html\nor the github sponsors button on https://github.com/scons/scons.\n\n\nfor more information\n====================\n\ncheck the scons web site at https://www.scons.org/\n\n\ncopyright (c) 2001 -
