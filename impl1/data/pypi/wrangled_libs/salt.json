automation*\n*engine.*\n\nabout salt\n==========\nbuilt on python, salt is an event-driven automation tool and framework to\ndeploy, configure, and manage complex it systems. use salt to automate common\ninfrastructure administration tasks and ensure that all the components of your\ninfrastructure are operating in a consistent desired state.\n\nsalt has many possible uses, including configuration management, which involves:\n\n* managing operating system deployment and configuration.\n* installing and configuring software applications and services.\n* managing servers, virtual machines, containers, databases, web servers,\n  network devices, and more.\n* ensuring consistent configuration and preventing configuration drift.\n\nsalt is ideal for configuration management because it is pluggable,\ncustomizable, and plays well with many existing technologies. salt enables you\nto deploy and manage applications that use any tech stack running on nearly any\n`operating system <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/salt-supported-operating-systems.html>`_,\nincluding different types of network devices such as switches and routers from a\nvariety of vendors.\n\nin addition to configuration management salt can also:\n\n* automate and orchestrate routine it processes, such as common required tasks\n  for scheduled server downtimes or upgrading operating systems or applications.\n* create self-aware, self-healing systems that can automatically respond to\n  outages, common administration problems, or other important events.\n\n\nabout our sponsors\n==================\nsalt powers vmware's `vmware aria automation config`_\n(previously vrealize automation saltstack config / saltstack enterprise), and can be found\nunder the hood of products from juniper, cisco, cloudflare, nutanix, suse, and\ntieto, to name a few.\n\nthe original sponsor of our community, saltstack, was `acquired by vmware in 2020 <https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/saltstack.html>`_.\nthe salt project remains an open source ecosystem that vmware supports and\ncontributes to. vmware ensures the code integrity and quality of the salt\nmodules by acting as the official sponsor and manager of the salt project. many\nof the core salt project contributors are also vmware employees. this team\ncarefully reviews and enhances the salt modules to ensure speed, quality, and\nsecurity.\n\n\ndownload and install salt\n=========================\nsalt is tested and packaged to run on centos, debian, rhel, ubuntu, macos,\nwindows, and more. download salt and get started now. see\n`supported operating systems
