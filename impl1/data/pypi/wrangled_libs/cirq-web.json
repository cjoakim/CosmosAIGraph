  "description": ".. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantumlib/cirq/master/docs/images/cirq_logo_color.png\n  :target: https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq\n  :alt: cirq\n  :width: 500px\n\n`cirq <https://quantumai.google/cirq>`__ is a python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum\ncircuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.\n\nthis module is **cirq-web**, which allows users to take advantage of browser based 3d visualization tools\nand features in cirq. cirq-web also provides a development environment for contributors to create and add \ntheir own visualizations to the module.\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\ndocumentation for cirq-web can be found in the readme files located in this module's subdirectories.\n\nbelow is a quick example of how to generate a portable 3d rendering of the bloch sphere using cirq-web:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import cirq\n    from cirq_web import blochsphere\n\n    # prepare a state\n    zero_state = [1+0j, 0+0j]\n    state_vector = cirq.to_valid_state_vector(zero_state)\n\n    # create and display the bloch sphere\n    sphere = blochsphere(state_vector=state_vector)\n    sphere.generate_html_file()\n\nthis will create the file in the current working directory. there are additional options to specify the\noutput directory or to open the visualization in a browser for example.\n\nyou can also view and interact with a bloch sphere in a colab or jupyter notebook setting\nwith the following:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import cirq\n    from cirq_web import blochsphere\n\n    # prepare a state\n    zero_state = [1+0j, 0+0j]\n    state_vector = cirq.to_valid_state_vector(zero_state)\n\n    # create and display the bloch sphere\n    sphere = blochsphere(state_vector=state_vector)\n    display(sphere)\n\nsee the example jupyter notebook in this directory for more examples on how to use cirq-web.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\ncirq-web is currently in development, and therefore is only available via pre-release.\n\nto install the pre-release version of only **cirq-web**, use `pip install cirq-web --pre`.\n\nnote, that this will install both cirq-web and cirq-core.\n\nto get all the optional modules installed as well, you'll have to use `pip install cirq` or `pip install cirq --pre` for the pre-release version.\n",
