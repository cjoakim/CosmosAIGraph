  "description": "# microsoft azure sdk for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure iotcentral management client library.\nthis package has been tested with python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.\nfor a more complete view of azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).\n\n\n# usage\n\n\nto learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)\n\n\n\nfor docs and references, see [python sdk references](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)\ncode samples for this package can be found at [iotcentral management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=getting%20started%20-%20managing&terms=getting%20started%20-%20managing) on docs.microsoft.com.\nadditional code samples for different azure services are available at [samples repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)\n\n\n# provide feedback\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the\n[issues](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project. \n\n\n![impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fazure-mgmt-iotcentral%2freadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 9.0.0 (2021-11-11)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model app has a new parameter state\n  - model app has a new parameter identity\n  - model apppatch has a new parameter state\n  - model apppatch has a new parameter identity\n\n## 9.0.0b1 (2021-05-13)\n\nthis is beta preview version.\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\n- credential system has been completly revamped:\n\n  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\n  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`\n\n\n- the `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. example: `myclient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=true)`. for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n- you can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead\n- operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.lropoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.lropoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.\n- exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror` (`clouderror` has been removed).\n- most of the operation kwarg have changed. some of the most noticeable:\n\n  - `raw` has been removed. equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal http response for advanced user\n  - for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n\n**general new features**\n\n- type annotations support using `typing`. sdks are mypy ready.\n- this client has now stable and official support for async. check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.\n- this client now support natively tracing library like opencensus or opentelemetry. see this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.\n\n## 4.1.0 (2021-02-19)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model apptemplate has a new parameter industry\n  - model apptemplate has a new parameter locations\n  - model operation has a new parameter properties\n  - model operation has a new parameter origin\n\n## 4.0.0 (2021-01-05)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model apptemplate has a new parameter name\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - model apptemplate no longer has parameter app_template_name\n\n## 3.1.0 (2020-06-30)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model apppatch has a new parameter sku\n\n## 3.0.0 (2020-03-09)\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n- removed operation appsoperations.list_templates\n\n## 2.0.0 (2019-12-25)\n\n**features**\n\n  - added operation appsoperations.list_templates\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that might introduce\nbreaking changes if from some import. in summary, some modules were\nincorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. this fixed several\nissues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in\nthe first place. iotcentralclient cannot be imported from\nazure.mgmt.iotcentreal.iot_central_client anymore (import from\nazure.mgmt.iotcentreal works like before) iotcentralclientconfiguration\nimport has been moved from azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.iot_central_client\nto azure.mgmt.iotcentreal a model myclass from a \"models\" sub-module\ncannot be imported anymore using azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.models.my_class\n(import from azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.models works like before) an\noperation class myclassoperations from an operations sub-module cannot\nbe imported anymore using\nazure.mgmt.iotcentreal.operations.my_class_operations (import from\nazure.mgmt.iotcentreal.operations works like before) last but not least,\nhttp connection pooling is now enabled by default. you should always use\na client as a context manager, or call close(), or use no more than one\nclient per process.\n\n## 1.0.0 (2018-10-26)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model operationinputs has a new parameter type\n  - model errordetails has a new parameter details\n  - added operation appsoperations.check_subdomain_availability\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - operation appsoperations.check_name_availability has a new\n    signature\n\n**note**\n\n  - azure-mgmt-nspkg is not installed anymore on python 3 (pep420-based\n    namespace package)\n\n## 0.2.0 (2018-08-07)\n\n  - replace api version by 2018-09-01\n\n## 0.1.0 (2018-07-16)\n\n  - initial release with support for 2017-07-01-privatepreview\n\n\n",
