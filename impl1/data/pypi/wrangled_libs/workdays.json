  "description": "extend python datetime with excel-like workday addition/subtraction\n    functionality:\n\n    networkdays(start_date,end_date,holidays)\n\n    returns the number of whole working days between start_date and\n    end_date (inclusive of both start_date and end_date). working days\n    exclude weekends and any dates identified in holidays. use networkdays\n    to calculate employee benefits that accrue based on the number of\n    days worked during a specific term.\n\n    workday(start_date,days,[holidays])\n\n    returns a number that represents a date that is the indicated number\n    of working days before or after a date (the starting date). working\n    days exclude weekends and any dates identified as holidays. use\n    workday to exclude weekends or holidays when you calculate invoice\n    due dates, expected delivery times, or the number of days of work\n    performed.\n\n    this module has similarities with the businesshours module - you may\n    want to check it out as well to see which one better fits your needs.",
