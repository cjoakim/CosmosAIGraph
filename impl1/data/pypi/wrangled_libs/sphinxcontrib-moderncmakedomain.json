  "description": "# sphinx domain for modern cmake\n\nthis is taken directly from the kitware git repository's utilities directory.\nthe original [sphinxcontrib-cmakedomain][] has not been touched in quite some and\nas a result it was wildly out of date. documenting cmake domain entities in\nprojects is painful otherwise. this works *exactly* in the same way as kitware,\nso some time might be needed to study their approach to these problems.\n\nthis repository is under the same license as all of cmake, which is the\nbsd-3-clause license.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\nany issues you run into with this plugin must be reported to [kitware][],\nunless they involve the packaging itself. the python files exactly match\nthe cmake source for the released version numbers.\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n# installation\n\n## pypi\n\nthis domain is available via pypi. install it directly via `pip`:\n\n```\n$ pip install sphinxcontrib-moderncmakedomain\n```\n\nalternatively, place it inside of your `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`,\n`requirements.txt` or whatever system it is that you use to declare and manage\nyour dependencies. a new version will usually only be released if there is a\nchange to this extension inside cmake.\n\n## git\n\nthis module is installable via `pip` and github directly as well\n\n```\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/scikit-build/moderncmakedomain.git\n```\n\n# usage\n\nto enable the use of the `moderncmakedomain`, add\n`sphinxcontrib.moderncmakedomain` to the `extensions` variable of your\n`conf.py` file:\n\n```python\nextensions = [..., 'sphinxcontrib.moderncmakedomain', ...]\n```\n\nthe plugin currently provides several directives and references. these are\ndocumented below.\n\n## directives\n\n|     directive      |                      description                    |\n|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------|\n| `cmake:variable::` | for a basic variable                                |\n| `cmake:command::`  | for a function                                      |\n| `cmake-module::`   | autodoc style extractor (takes a relative filepath) |\n| `cmake:envvar::`   | for environment variables                           |\n\nto declare any of the references found below, they must be placed into a\ndirectory with the same name under the sphinx sourcedir/master doc. thus,\n`prop_tgt/my_personal_property.rst` can be referred to with\n``:prop_tgt:`my_personal_property` ``. this is currently the *only* way cmake\npermits declaring new properties.\n\n## references\n\neach reference below can be placed into a directory with the same name to\ndocument custom extensions provided by your cmake libraries.\n\n|      ref       |                   description                      |\n|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| `:variable:`   | refer to a cmake

             |\n\n# history\n\n`sphinx-moderncmakedomain` was initially developed in october 2018 by\n[slurps-mad-rips][slurps-mad-rips] to  help write cmake documentation by simply\npublishing a python package of the same. this was a critical step to  ease the\nmaintenance of sphinx-based documentation and avoid systematically copying the\nassociated python  module maintained within the cmake repository.\n\nlater in early august 2021, [henryiii][henryiii] discovered the\n`sphinx-moderncmakedomain` project  while working on scikit-build issue\n[#574][skbuild-issue-574] intended to simplify its documentation generation\ninfrastructure and avoid updating its own copy of the sphinx extension.\n[henryiii][henryiii] and [jcfr][jcfr] then worked with\n[slurps-mad-rips][slurps-mad-rips] to establish a transition plan to\ncollaboratively maintain the project within the scikit-build organization.\n\n[sphinxcontrib-cmakedomain]: https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/cmakedomain\n[kitware]:
