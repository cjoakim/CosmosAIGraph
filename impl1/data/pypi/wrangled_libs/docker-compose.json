  "description": "docker compose\n==============\n[![build status](https://ci-next.docker.com/public/buildstatus/icon?job=compose/master)](https://ci-next.docker.com/public/job/compose/job/master/)\n\n![docker compose](logo.png?raw=true \"docker compose logo\")\n\ndocker compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on docker\ndefined using the [compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).\na compose file is used to define how the one or more containers that make up\nyour application are configured.\nonce you have a compose file, you can create and start your application with a\nsingle command: `docker-compose up`.\n\ncompose files can be used to deploy applications locally, or to the cloud on\n[amazon ecs](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs) or\n[microsoft aci](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-instances/) using\nthe docker cli. you can read more about how to do this:\n- [compose for amazon ecs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/ecs-integration/)\n- [compose for microsoft aci](https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/aci-integration/)\n\nwhere to get docker compose\n----------------------------\n\n### windows and macos\n\ndocker compose is included in\n[docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\nfor windows and macos.\n\n### linux\n\nyou can download docker compose binaries from the\n[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.\n\n### using pip\n\nif your platform is not supported, you can download docker compose using `pip`:\n\n```console\npip install docker-compose\n```\n\n> **note:** docker compose requires python 3.6 or later.\n\nquick start\n-----------\n\nusing docker compose is basically a three-step process:\n1. define your app's environment with a `dockerfile` so it can be\n   reproduced anywhere.\n2. define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so\n   they can be run together in an isolated environment.\n3. lastly, run `docker-compose up` and compose will start and run your entire\n   app.\n\na compose file looks like this:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  web:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:5000\"\n    volumes:\n      - .:/code\n  redis:\n    image: redis\n```\n\nyou can find examples of compose applications in our\n[awesome compose repository](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose).\n\nfor more information about the compose format, see the\n[compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\nwant to help develop docker compose? check out our\n[contributing documentation](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/contributing.md).\n\nif you find an issue, please report it on the\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).\n\nreleasing\n---------\n\nreleases are built by maintainers, following an outline of the [release process](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/project/release-process.md).\n\n\n",
