  "description": "torchaudio: an audio library for pytorch\n========================================\n\n[![documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=docs&url=https%3a%2f%2fpypi.org%2fpypi%2ftorchaudio%2fjson&query=%24.info.version&colorb=brightgreen&prefix=v)](https://pytorch.org/audio/main/)\n[![anaconda badge](https://anaconda.org/pytorch/torchaudio/badges/downloads.svg)](https://anaconda.org/pytorch/torchaudio)\n[![anaconda-server badge](https://anaconda.org/pytorch/torchaudio/badges/platforms.svg)](https://anaconda.org/pytorch/torchaudio)\n\n![torchaudio logo](docs/source/_static/img/logo.png)\n\nthe aim of torchaudio is to apply [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) to\nthe audio domain. by supporting pytorch, torchaudio follows the same philosophy\nof providing strong gpu acceleration, having a focus on trainable features through\nthe autograd system, and having consistent style (tensor names and dimension names).\ntherefore, it is primarily a machine learning library and not a general signal\nprocessing library. the benefits of pytorch can be seen in torchaudio through\nhaving all the computations be through pytorch operations which makes it easy\nto use and feel like a natural extension.\n\n- [support audio i/o (load files, save files)](http://pytorch.org/audio/main/)\n  - load a variety of audio formats, such as `wav`, `mp3`, `ogg`, `flac`, `opus`, `sphere`, into a torch tensor using sox\n  - [kaldi (ark/scp)](http://pytorch.org/audio/main/kaldi_io.html)\n- [dataloaders for common audio datasets](http://pytorch.org/audio/main/datasets.html)\n- audio and speech processing functions\n  -
