  "description": "the iisignature package\n=======================\n\nthis package provides tools for calculating the signature and log signature of a data stream. \nthese are summary statistics of piecewise linear paths, consisting of iterated integrals, inspired by rough path theory. \nsee <https://github.com/bottler/phd-docs/blob/master/iisignature.pdf> for documentation, the page\n<https://github.com/bottler/phd-docs> for more information about the calculations, \nand <https://github.com/bottler/iisignature> for source code.\n\nit is work in progress.\n\npython\n------\n\ninstall with::\n\n    pip install iisignature\n\ndon't install this package if you don't have numpy > 1.7 installed. \non windows, this package is not usable with python 2.x. \nfor python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 on windows, there are precompiled wheels available, you may need to do ``pip install wheel`` to use them.\non other platforms, you will need to be able to compile c++ extensions. \non a mac, you will need to have installed xcode and the xcode command line tools before doing the installation.\nthe fastest, on-the-fly compiled versions of the log signature calculations are for windows, mac and linux, on both 32 and 64 bit.\n\nsometimes there are compile errors on a mac, if this happens try::\n\n    macosx_deployment_target=10.9 pip install iisignature\n\nuse without installing a released version\n-----------------------------------------\n\nto install the current \"master\" development version straight from github you can type::\n\n    pip install git+git://github.com/bottler/iisignature\n\n>from a checkout of this repository, you can build the extension and run the tests using::\n\n    python setup.py test\n\n>from a checkout of this repository, you can build the extension into this directory itself using::\n\n    python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n\nafter which you can use the package in python in this directory, use the examples in the ``examples`` directory, or add this directory to your pythonpath and then use the package in python anywhere.\n\n\nauthors\n-------\n\n* benjamin graham\n* jeremy reizenstein\n\nthanks\n------\n\nthis package includes bch coefficients from fernando casas and ander murua.\n<http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2656>\n\n\n",
