  "description": "snowball stemming library collection for python\n===============================================\n\npython 3 (>= 3.3) is supported.  we no longer actively support python 2 as\nthe python developers stopped supporting it at the start of 2020.  snowball\n2.1.0 was the last release to officially support python 2.\n\nwhat is stemming?\n-----------------\n\nstemming maps different forms of the same word to a common \"stem\" - for\nexample, the english stemmer maps *connection*, *connections*, *connective*,\n*connected*, and *connecting* to *connect*.  so a searching for *connected*\nwould also find documents which only have the other forms.\n\nthis stem form is often a word itself, but this is not always the case as this\nis not a requirement for text search systems, which are the intended field of\nuse.  we also aim to conflate words with the same meaning, rather than all\nwords with a common linguistic root (so *awe* and *awful* don't have the same\nstem), and over-stemming is more problematic than under-stemming so we tend not\nto stem in cases that are hard to resolve.  if you want to always reduce words\nto a root form and/or get a root form which is itself a word then snowball's\nstemming algorithms likely aren't the right answer.\n\nhow to use library\n------------------\n\nthe ``snowballstemmer`` module has two functions.\n\nthe ``snowballstemmer.algorithms`` function returns a list of available\nalgorithm names.\n\nthe ``snowballstemmer.stemmer`` function takes an algorithm name and returns a\n``stemmer`` object.\n\n``stemmer`` objects have a ``stemmer.stemword(word)`` method and a\n``stemmer.stemwords(word[])`` method.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   import snowballstemmer\n\n   stemmer = snowballstemmer.stemmer('english');\n   print(stemmer.stemwords(\"we are the world\".split()));\n\nautomatic acceleration\n----------------------\n\n`pystemmer <https://pypi.org/project/pystemmer/>`_ is a wrapper module for\nsnowball's ``libstemmer_c`` and should provide results 100% compatible to\n**snowballstemmer**.\n\n**pystemmer** is faster because it wraps generated c versions of the stemmers;\n**snowballstemmer** uses generate python code and is slower but offers a pure\npython solution.\n\nif pystemmer is installed, ``snowballstemmer.stemmer`` returns a ``pystemmer``\n``stemmer`` object which provides the same ``stemmer.stemword()`` and\n``stemmer.stemwords()`` methods.\n\nbenchmark\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nthis is a crude benchmark which measures the time for running each stemmer on\nevery word in its sample vocabulary (10,787,583 words over 26 languages).  it's\nnot a realistic test of normal use as a real application would do much more\nthan just stemming.  it's also skewed towards the stemmers which do more work\nper word and towards those with larger sample vocabularies.\n\n* python 2.7 + **snowballstemmer** : 13m00s (15.0 * pystemmer)\n* python 3.7 + **snowballstemmer** : 12m19s (14.2 * pystemmer)\n* pypy 7.1.1 (python 2.7.13) + **snowballstemmer** : 2m14s (2.6 * pystemmer)\n* pypy 7.1.1 (python 3.6.1) + **snowballstemmer** : 1m46s (2.0 * pystemmer)\n* python 2.7 + **pystemmer** : 52s\n\nfor reference the equivalent test for c runs in 9 seconds.\n\nthese results are for snowball 2.0.0.  they're likely to evolve over time as\nthe code snowball generates for both python and c continues to improve (for\na much older test over a different set of stemmers using python 2.7,\n**snowballstemmer** was 30 times slower than **pystemmer**, or 9 times slower\nwith **pypy**).\n\nthe message to take away is that if you're stemming a lot of words you should\neither install **pystemmer** (which **snowballstemmer** will then automatically\nuse for you as described above) or use pypy.\n\nthe testapp example\n-------------------\n\nthe ``testapp.py`` example program allows you to run any of the stemmers\non a sample vocabulary.\n\nusage::\n\n   testapp.py <algorithm> \"sentences ... \"\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ python testapp.py english \"sentences... \"\n\n\n",
