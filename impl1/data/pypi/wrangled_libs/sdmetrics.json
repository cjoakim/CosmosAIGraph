it to the real data that you're trying to mimic. it includes a variety of metrics to capture different aspects of the data, for example **quality and privacy**. it also includes reports that you can run to generate insights, visualize data and share with your team.\n\nthe sdmetrics library is **model-agnostic**, meaning you can use any synthetic data. the library does not need to know how you created the data. \n\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"docs/images/column_comparison.png\"></img>\n\n# install\n\ninstall sdmetrics using pip or conda. we recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other software on your device.\n\n```bash\npip install sdmetrics\n```\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge sdmetrics\n```\n\nfor more information about using sdmetrics, visit the [sdmetrics documentation](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics).\n\n# usage\n\nget started with **sdmetrics reports** using some demo data,\n\n```python\nfrom sdmetrics import load_demo\nfrom sdmetrics.reports.single_table import qualityreport\n\nreal_data, synthetic_data, metadata = load_demo(modality='single_table')\n\nmy_report = qualityreport()\nmy_report.generate(real_data, synthetic_data, metadata)\n```\n```\ncreating report: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 4/4 [00:00<00:00,  5.22it/s]\n\noverall quality score: 82.84%\n\nproperties:\ncolumn shapes: 82.78%\ncolumn pair trends: 82.9%\n```\n\nonce you generate the report, you can drill down on the details and visualize the results.\n\n```python\nmy_report.get_visualization(property_name='column pair trends')\n```\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"docs/images/column_pairs.png\"></img>\n\nsave the report and share it with your team.\n```python\nmy_report.save(filepath='demo_data_quality_report.pkl')\n\n# load it at any point in the future\nmy_report = qualityreport.load(filepath='demo_data_quality_report.pkl')\n```\n\n**want more metrics?** you can also manually apply any of the metrics in this library to your data.\n\n```python\n# calculate whether the synthetic data respects the min/max bounds\n# set by the real data\nfrom sdmetrics.single_column import boundaryadherence\n\nboundaryadherence.compute(\n    real_data['start_date'],\n    synthetic_data['start_date']\n)\n```\n```\n0.8503937007874016\n```\n\n```python\n# calculate whether the synthetic data is new or whether it's an exact copy of the real data\nfrom sdmetrics.single_table import newrowsynthesis\n\nnewrowsynthesis.compute(\n    real_data,\n    synthetic_data,\n    metadata\n)\n```\n```\n1.0\n```\n\n# what's next?\n\nto learn more about the reports

ai lab](\nhttps://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. after 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we\ncreated [datacebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.\ntoday, datacebo is the proud developer of sdv, the largest ecosystem for\nsynthetic data generation & evaluation. it is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic\ndata, including:\n\n* \ud83d\udd04 data discovery & transformation. reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.\n* \ud83e\udde0 multiple machine learning models -- ranging from copulas to deep learning -- to create tabular,\n  multi table and time series data.\n* \ud83d\udcca measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data\n  generation models.\n\n[get started using the sdv package](https://sdv.dev/sdv/getting_started/install.html) -- a fully\nintegrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. or, use the standalone libraries\nfor specific needs.\n\n\n# history\n\n## v0.13.0 - 2023-12-04\n\nthis release makes significant improvements to the diagnostic reports! the report now runs a diagnostic to calculate scores for three basic but important properties of your data: data validity, data structure and in the multi table case, relationship validity. data validity checks that the columns of your data are valid (eg. correct range or values). data structure makes sure the synthetic data has the correct columns. relationship validity checks to make sure key references are correct and the cardinality is within ranges seen in the real data. these changes are meant to make the `diagnosticreport` a quick way for you to see if there are any major problems with your synthetic data.\n\nadditionally, some general improvements were made and bugs were resolved. the `logisticdetection` and `svcdetection` metrics were fixed to only use boolean, categorical, datetime and numeric columns in their calculations. a bug that prevented visualizations from displaying on jupyter notebooks was patched. the cardinality property in the multi table `qualityreport` can now handle multiple foreign keys to the same parent. finally, a new visualization was added for sequential/timeseries data called `get_column_line_plot`.\n\n### new features\n\n* detection metrics should only use statistically modeled columns (filter out the rest) -
