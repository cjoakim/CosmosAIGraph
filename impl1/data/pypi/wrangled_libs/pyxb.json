  "description": "pyxb is a pure `python <http://www.python.org>`_ package that generates\npython code for classes that correspond to data structures defined by\n`xmlschema <http://www.w3.org/xml/schema>`_.  in concept it is similar to\n`jaxb <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaxb>`_ for java and `codesynthesis xsd\n<http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/>`_ for c++.\n\nthe major goals of pyxb are:\n\n* provide a generated python interface that is \"pythonic\", meaning similar\n  to one that would have been hand-written:\n\n  + attributes and elements are python properties, with name conflicts\n    resolved in favor of elements\n  + elements with maxoccurs larger than 1 are stored as python lists\n  + bindings for type extensions inherit from the binding for the base type\n  + enumeration constraints are exposed as class (constant) variables\n\n* support bi-directional conversion (document to python and back)\n\n* allow easy customization of the generated bindings to provide\n  functionality along with content\n\n* support all xmlschema features that are in common use, including:\n\n  + complex content models (nested all/choice/sequence)\n  + cross-namespace dependencies\n  + include and import directives\n  + constraints on simple types",
