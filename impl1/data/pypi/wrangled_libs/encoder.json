  "description": "# raspberry pi rotary encoder library\n\nencoder library for raspberry pi for measuring quadrature encoded signals.\n### about\nencoder class allows to work with rotary encoder which connected via two pin a and b (en11 for example). works only on interrupts because all rpi pins allow that. this library is a simple port of the arduino encoder library (https://github.com/paulstoffregen/encoder)\n\n### installation\n```sh\n$ pip install encoder\n```\n\n### usage\n\nto use it, you need to connect pins a and b and gnd of the rotary encoder to two pins and gnd of the raspberry pi, for example 24 and 10. then just use it:\n```python\nimport encoder\n\nenc = encoder.encoder(24, 10)\nenc.read()\n```\n\nyou can use two or more rotary encoders:\n```python\nimport encoder\n\nenc_1 = encoder.encoder(24, 10)\nenc_2 = encoder.encoder(25, 9)\n```\n\n### note\nif the encoder works in the wrong direction, for example, it reduces the position when turning clockwise, you just need to swap pins a and b in the code.\n\nlicense\n----\n\nmit\n\n\n",
