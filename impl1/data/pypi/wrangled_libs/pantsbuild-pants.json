  "description": "pants is an apache2 licensed build tool written in python and rust.\n\nthe latest documentation can be found at [pantsbuild.org](https://www.pantsbuild.org/).\n\n\n# 2.17.x release series\n\n\u2757\u2757\u2757 this project is no longer being released via pypi, and is instead released via github releases. see https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/releases\n\n## what's new\n\nindividuals and companies can now [sponsor pants financially](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship).\n\npants is an open-source project that is not owned or controlled by any one company or organization, and does incur some expenses. these expenses are managed by pants build, a non-profit that was established for this purpose. this non-profit's only source of revenue is sponsorship by individuals and companies that use pants.\n\nwe offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [github](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild).\n\n### overall\n\nthe [`pants` launcher binary](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants) (aka `scie-pants`) is now the recommended way to run pants.\nuse of a `./pants` shell script in a repository is deprecated.\n\nthe `pants` launcher has numerous benefits, such as:\n\n* automatically download and maintain a python distribution for running pants\n* run `pants` from any directory within a repository and not just the build root\n* far less overhead when starting commands (up to 4-5\u00d7)\n\nsee the [pants  installation\ninstructions](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/installation) for additional information on how to migrate to the `pants` launcher binary.\n\nrelated to this, pants' distribution model is changing, and 2.17 will be the last version where:\n\n* the `pantsbuild.pants` package is published to pypi. use [the `pants_requirements` target](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/reference-pants_requirements) for installing the requisite packages for plugins, rather than `python_requirement` or similar.\n* the universal (cross-platform) `pants` pex is published to github releases. for future releases, smaller per-platform pexes will be attached instead.\n\n### performance\n\nas mentioned above, the new launcher binary reduces start-up overhead.\n\nlarge files are now cached as standalone files on disk, rather than stored directly in the internal database pants uses for cache (but still under the `~/.cache/pants/lmdb_store` directory). this improves performance for manipulating these files, especially when the cache directory and sandbox temporary directory are on the same file system and thus allow hard-linking.\n\n### backends\n\n#### python\n\npython dependencies are now analyzed via an intrinsic rule implemented in rust for increased performance\nover the prior python implementation of the rule. see [#18854](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/18854) for\ndiscusion of the performance improvements.\n\nexported mutable virtualenvs can now include [pep-660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) editable installs of `python_distribution` targets.\nto enable this feature for a resolve, add that resolve's name to the `[export].py_editables_in_resolves` list in `pants.toml`.\nsee [#18639](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/18639) for details on pants' pep-660 implementation.\n\nthe default `pip` pants uses under the hood has changed from 20.3.4 to 23.1.2. this newer `pip` has better dependency resolution performance in many cases, but may give different results than the earlier `pip`. of course those results will still be correct in the sense that they will be compatible with your requirements and constraints.\n\nthe `python_awslambda` or `python_google_cloud_function` targets now support a new 'zip' layout, as recommended by the cloud vendors. this layout gives smaller packages and faster cold starts than the existing lambdex layout, and will become the default in 2.18. see the docs [for `python_awslambda`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/awslambda-python#migrating-from-pants-216-and-earlier) and [for `python_google_cloud_function`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/google-cloud-function-python#migrating-from-pants-216-and-earlier).\n\nthe default value for the `[python].interpreter_constraints` option was deprecated in 2.16 and is now removed: `pants.toml` must provide this option. we recommend constraining to a single interpreter minor version if you can, for instance: `interpreter_constraints = ['==3.11.*']`. see [the interpreter compatibility docs for more details](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-interpreter-compatibility).\n\n#### docker\n\nthe docker backend now supports authenticating with registries via the `docker_host`, `docker_config` and `docker_cert_path` environment variables.\n\n#### new: javascript (experimental!)\n\npants now has _very early_ experimental support for javascript thanks to ongoing efforts by tobias nilsson and\ntheo ribeiro. please note that the javascript backend is still incomplete, is being actively developed, and _probably\nhas critical bugs_. despite that, the pants maintainers would appreciate any feedback from the community to help\nguide our development efforts.\n\nsupported goals are:\n\n* `test`: letting you run tests via runners installed with the package manager of your choice.\n* `package` goal, either to run a customized `package.json` script that produces an artifact via `node_build_script`, or to pack a tarball for npm-registry publication via the `npm_distribution` target.\n* `tailor`: generates build file targets for `*.js`, `*.test.js` and `package.json` files.\n* `generate-lockfile`: creates the lockfile in the format matching a projects package manager.\n\nthe backend supports all package managers provided by `corepack`. `yarn@v2` and [plugnplay](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) is not supported.\n\nenable the `pants.backend.experimental.javascript` backend to try out this support. please [file issues](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) for any issues encountered, and follow along [the stabilization ticket on github](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/19240).\n\n#### new: taplo toml formatter\n\npants now supports the [taplo toml formatter](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/). enable the `pants.backend.tools.taplo`\nbackend to add this support.\n\n### plugin api changes\n\nrules should now request output types which do not need an input type via the new one-argument form of `get`. for\nexample, rules can now write `await get(chosenlocalenvironmentname)`. certain request types which exists only to\nwork around the previous lack of such synax are now deprecated in favor of the one argument `get()` form.\n\nthe `pythonbinary` type is now deprecated, use `pythonbuildstandalone` instead.\n\n----\n\n## 2.17.1 (nov 10, 2023)\n\nthe second stable release of the `2.17.x` series,
