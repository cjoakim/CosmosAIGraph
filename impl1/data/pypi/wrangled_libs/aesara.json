  "description": "aesara is a python library that allows you to define, optimize, and efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. it is built on top of numpy_. aesara features:\n\n * **tight integration with numpy:** a similar interface to numpy's. numpy.ndarrays are also used internally in aesara-compiled functions.\n * **efficient symbolic differentiation:** aesara can compute derivatives for functions of one or many inputs.\n * **speed and stability optimizations:** avoid nasty bugs when computing expressions such as log(1 + exp(x)) for large values of x.\n * **dynamic c code generation:** evaluate expressions faster.\n * **extensive unit-testing and self-verification:** includes tools for detecting and diagnosing bugs and/or potential problems.\n\n.. _numpy: http://numpy.scipy.org/\n",
