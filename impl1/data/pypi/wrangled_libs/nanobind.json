  "description": "\n![nanobind logo](\nhttps://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/raw/master/docs/images/logo.jpg?raw=true)\n\n_nanobind_ is a small binding library that exposes c++ types in python and\nvice versa. it is reminiscent of\n[boost.python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/python/doc/html)\nand [pybind11](http://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and uses near-identical\nsyntax. in contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is more efficient:\nbindings compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and\nhave better runtime performance.\n\nmore concretely,\n[benchmarks](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark.html) show up\nto **~4\u00d7 faster** compile time, **~5\u00d7 smaller** binaries, and **~10\u00d7 lower**\nruntime overheads compared to pybind11. nanobind also outperforms cython in\nimportant metrics (**3-12\u00d7** binary size reduction, **1.6-4\u00d7** compilation time\nreduction, similar runtime performance).\n\nplease see the following links for tutorial and reference documentation in\n[html](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and\n[pdf](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/) formats.\n",
