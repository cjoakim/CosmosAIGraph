`pip install \"panflute[extras]\"` to include extra dependencies (`yamlloader`)\n- `pip install -u panflute` to upgrade\n- `pip uninstall panflute` to remove\n\nyou need a matching pandoc version for panflute to work flawlessly. see [supported pandoc versions] for details. or, use the [conda] method to install below to have the pandoc version automatically managed for you.\n\n### conda\n\nto manage panflute with a matching pandoc version, open the command line and run\n\n- `conda install -c conda-forge pandoc 'panflute>=2.0.5'` to install both\n    `conda install -c conda-forge pandoc 'panflute>=2.0.5' yamlloader` to include extra dependencies\n- `conda update pandoc panflute` to upgrade both\n- `conda remove pandoc panflute` to remove both\n\nyou may also replace `conda` by `mamba`, which is basically a drop-in replacement of the conda package manager. see [mamba-org/mamba: the fast cross-platform package manager](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) for details.\n\n### note on versions\n\n#### supported python versions\n\npanflute 1.12 or above dropped support of python 2. when using python 3, depending on your setup, you may need to use `pip3`/`python3` explicitly. if you need to use panflute in python 2, install panflute 1.11.x or below.\n\ncurrently supported python versions: [![python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/panflute.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/panflute/). check `setup.py` for details, which further indicates support of pypy on top of cpython.\n\n#### supported pandoc versions\n\npandoc versioning semantics is [major.major.minor.patch](https://pvp.haskell.org) and panflute's is major.minor.patch. below we shows matching versions of pandoc that panflute supports, in descending order. only major version is shown as long as the minor versions doesn't matter.\n\n<!-- for pandoc api verion, check https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc for pandoc-types, which is the same thing. -->\n\n| panflute version | supported pandoc versions | supported pandoc api versions |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| 2.3.0            | 2.11.0.4\u20133.0.x            | 1.22\u20131.23                     |\n| 2.2.4            | 2.11.0.4\u20132.17.x           | 1.22\u20131.22.1                   |\n| 2.1              | 2.11.0.4\u20142.14.x           | 1.22                          |\n| 2.0              | 2.11.0.4\u20142.11.x           | 1.22                          |\n| not supported    | 2.10                      | 1.21                          |\n| 1.12             | 2.7-2.9                   | 1.17.5\u20131.20                   |\n\nnote: pandoc 2.10 is short lived and 2.11 has minor api changes comparing to that, mainly for fixing its shortcomings. please avoid using pandoc 2.10.\n\n## dev install\n\nafter cloning the repo and opening the panflute folder, run\n\n- `python setup.py install` to install the package locally\n- `python setup.py develop` to install locally with a symlink so changes are automatically updated\n\n## contributing\n\nfeel free to submit push requests. for consistency, code should comply with [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) (as long as its reasonable), and with the style guides by [@kennethreitz](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/) and [google](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). read more [here](/contributing.md).\n\n## license\n\nbsd3 license (following [`pandocfilters`](https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters) by @jgm).\n\n\n## changelog\n\n- `2.3.0` update [pandoc api](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-types/blob/master/changelog) from 1.22 to 1.23 ([pandoc 3.0](https://pandoc.org/releases.html#pandoc-3.0-2023-01-18)):\n    - add `figure` block object\n    - remove `null` block object (scheduled for removed)\n",
