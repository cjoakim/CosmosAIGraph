  "description": "peppercorn\n==========\n\na library for converting a token stream into a data structure comprised of\nsequences, mappings, and scalars, developed primarily for converting http form\npost data into a richer data structure.  it runs on python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\nand 3.7.\n\nplease see https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/peppercorn/en/latest/\nfor the documentation.\n\nsee https://github.com/pylons/peppercorn for in-development version.\n\n\nchanges\n=======\n\n0.6 (2018-08-24)\n----------------\n\n- add support for python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.\n\n- drop support for python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n- add contributing.md and update docs. see\n  https://github.com/pylons/peppercorn/issues/13\n\n\n0.5 (2014-09-29)\n----------------\n\n- switch to an iterative parser rather than a recursive parser to avoid\n  dos attacks.\n\n- add the ``ignore`` operation. the subsequent data elements in the stream\n  will be ignored until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker.  this feature\n  is useful for form elements designed for client-side scripting, such as a\n  \"select all\" checkbox in the middle of a list of other kinds of fields.\n\n- add support for python 3.3.\n\n- drop support for python 2.5 and jython.\n\n\n0.4 (2012-02-14)\n----------------\n\n- drop support for python 2.4.\n\n- add support for python 3.2.\n\n- move project to github.\n\n- switch to pylons project sphinx theme.\n\n- add tox configuration.\n\n\n0.3 (2010-09-02)\n----------------\n\n- 0.2 was a brownbag release. handle the case where ``rename`` operation types\n  may not have children.\n\n\n0.2 (2010-09-02)\n----------------\n\n- add new operation type: ``rename``.  ``rename`` begins a special mode.\n  the value of the first subsequent data element in the stream will be\n  used within its parent sequence or mapping. any remaining data\n  elements until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker are ignored.\n  this is mostly in support of radio buttons.  see the ``rename`` docs\n  within `https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/peppercorn/en/latest/\n  <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/peppercorn/en/latest/>`_ for more\n  information.\n\n\n0.1 (2010-03-23)\n----------------\n\n- initial release.\n\n\n",
