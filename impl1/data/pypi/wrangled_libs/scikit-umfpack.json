  "description": "scikit-umfpack\n==============\n\n`scikit-umfpack <https://scikit-umfpack.github.io/scikit-umfpack>`_ provides\nwrapper of umfpack sparse direct solver to scipy.\n\nusage:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from scikits.umfpack import spsolve, splu\n    >>> lu = splu(a)\n    >>> x = spsolve(a, b)\n\ninstalling scikits.umfpack also enables using umfpack solver via some of\nthe scipy.sparse.linalg functions, for scipy >= 0.14.0. note you will\nneed to have installed umfpack before hand. umfpack is a part of\n`suitesparse <http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html>`__.\n\nreferences\n----------\n\n..

[3] t. a. davis, j. r. gilbert, s. larimore, e. ng, algorithm 836: colamd,\n       an approximate column minimum degree ordering algorithm, acm trans. on\n       mathematical software, 30(3), 2004, pp. 377--380.\n       https://doi.org/10.1145/1024074.1024080\n\ninstallation\n============\n\n.. include-start\n\nreleases of scikit-umfpack can be installed from source using ``pip``, or with\na package manager like ``conda`` . to install from source, first ensure the\ndependencies described in the next section are installed, then run::\n\n  pip install scikit-umfpack\n\nto install scikit-umfpack from its source code directory, run in the root of\na clone of the git repository::\n\n  pip install .\n\ndependencies\n------------\n\nscikit-umfpack depends on numpy, scipy, and suitesparse.\n\nto build scikit-umfpack, the following are needed:\n- a c compiler\n- a blas library with cblas symbols (e.g., openblas, accelerate on macos, or reference blas)\n- numpy\n- suitesparse (which contains umfpack)\n- swig\n\npkg-config is an optional dependency, if it's installed it may be used to\ndetect a blas library.\n\nsuitesparse cannot be installed from pypi, however it will likely be available\nfrom your package manager of choice. e.g., installing on ubuntu 22.04 can be\nachieved with::\n\n    sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev\n\nor from conda-forge on any supported os with::\n\n    conda install suitesparse\n\nsuitesparse can also be built from source, see the instructions in the readme\nof the `suitesparse repository <https://github.com/drtimothyaldendavis/suitesparse>`__.\n\n\ndetection of umfpack\n''''''''''''''''''''\n\nduring the build, scikit-umfpack tries to automatically detect the umfpack\nshared library and headers. in case suitesparse is installed in a non-standard\nlocation, this autodetection may fail. if that happens, it is possible to\nprovide the paths to the library and include directories in a config file (a\nmeson machine file). this file should contain absolute paths. for example, for\na conda env on windows, it may look like:\n\n.. code:: ini\n\n    [properties]\n    umfpack-libdir = 'c:\\users\\micromamba\\envs\\scikit-umfpack-dev\\library\\lib'\n    umfpack-includedir = 'c:\\users\\micromamba\\envs\\scikit-umfpack-dev\\library\\include\\suitesparse'\n\nif that file is named ``nativefile.ini``, then the ``pip`` invocation should\nlook like (note that ``$pwd`` ensures an absolute path to the native file is\nused)::\n\n    pip install . -csetup-args=--native-file=$pwd/nativefile.ini\n\n.. include-end\n\n\ndevelopment\n===========\n\ncode\n----\n\nyou can check the latest sources with the command:\n\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/scikit-umfpack/scikit-umfpack.git\n\nor if you have write privileges:\n\n::\n\n    git clone git@github.com:scikit-umfpack/scikit-umfpack.git\n\ntesting\n-------\n\nafter installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the source\ndirectory (you will need to have the ``pytest`` package installed):\n\n::\n\n   pip install pytest\n   pytest --pyargs scikits.umfpack\n",
