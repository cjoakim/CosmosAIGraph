  "description": "==================\npytest-travis-fold\n==================\n\n`pytest`_ plugin that folds captured output sections in travis ci build log.\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/530396/10524841/52ecb102-738a-11e5-83ab-f3cf1b3316fb.png\n    :alt: travis ci build log view\n\nin addition, pytest-travis-fold recognizes presence of the `pytest-cov`_ plugin\nand folds coverage reports accordingly.\n\ninstallation and usage\n----------------------\n\njust install the `pytest-travis-fold`_ package as part of your build.\n\nwhen using `tox`_, add the package to the ``deps`` list in your ``tox.ini``\nand make sure the ``travis`` environment variable is passed::\n\n    [testenv]\n    deps =\n        pytest-travis-fold\n    passenv = travis\n\nif you **don't** use tox and invoke ``py.test`` directly from ``.travis.yml``,\nyou may install the package as an additional ``install`` step::\n\n    install:\n      - pip install -e .\n      - pip install pytest-travis-fold\n\n    script: py.test\n\noutput folding is enabled automatically when running inside travis ci. it is ok\nto have the plugin installed also in your dev environment: it is only activated\nby checking the presence of the ``travis`` environmental variable, unless the\n``--travis-fold`` command line switch is used.\n\n\nthe ``travis`` fixture\n----------------------\nthe plugin by itself only makes the captured output sections appear folded.\nif you wish to make the same thing with arbitrary lines, you can do it manually\nby using the ``travis`` fixture.\n\nit is possible to fold the output of a certain code block using the\n``travis.folding_output()`` context manager::\n\n\tdef test_something(travis):\n\t\twith travis.folding_output():\n\t\t\tprint('lines, lines, lines...')\n\t\t\tprint('lots of them!')\n\t\t\t...\n\nor you may want to use lower-level ``travis.fold_string()`` and\n``travis.fold_lines()`` functions and then output the result as usual.\n\ncontributing\n------------\ncontributions are very welcome. tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\ndistributed under the terms of the `mit`_ license, \"pytest-travis-fold\" is free and open source software\n\n\nissues\n------\n\nif you encounter any problems, please `file an issue`_ along with a detailed description.\n\n.. _pytest-travis-fold: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-travis-fold\n.. _mit: http://opensource.org/licenses/mit\n.. _file an issue: https://github.com/abusalimov/pytest-travis-fold/issues\n.. _pytest: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest\n.. _pytest-cov: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov\n.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi\n\n\n",
