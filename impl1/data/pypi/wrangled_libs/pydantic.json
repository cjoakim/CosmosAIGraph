python type hints.\n\nfast and extensible, pydantic plays nicely with your linters/ide/brain.\ndefine how data should be in pure, canonical python 3.7+; validate it with pydantic.\n\n## pydantic company :rocket:\n\nwe've started a company based on the principles that i believe have led to pydantic's success.\nlearning more from the [company announcement](https://pydantic.dev/announcement/).\n\n## pydantic v1.10 vs. v2\n\npydantic v2 is a ground-up rewrite that offers many new features, performance improvements, and some breaking changes compared to pydantic v1.\n\nif you're using pydantic v1 you may want to look at the\n[pydantic v1.10 documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) or,\n[`1.10.x-fixes` git branch](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/tree/1.10.x-fixes). pydantic v2 also ships with the latest version of pydantic v1 built in so that you can incrementally upgrade your code base and projects: `from pydantic import v1 as pydantic_v1`.\n\n## help\n\nsee [documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for more details.\n\n## installation\n\ninstall using `pip install -u pydantic` or `conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`.\nfor more installation options to make pydantic even faster,\nsee the [install](https://docs.pydantic.dev/install/) section in the documentation.\n\n## a simple example\n\n```py\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import list, optional\nfrom pydantic import basemodel\n\nclass user(basemodel):\n    id: int\n    name: str = 'john doe'\n    signup_ts: optional[datetime] = none\n    friends: list[int] = []\n\nexternal_data = {'id': '123', 'signup_ts': '2017-06-01 12:22', 'friends': [1, '2', b'3']}\nuser = user(**external_data)\nprint(user)\n#> user id=123 name='john doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3]\nprint(user.id)\n#> 123\n```\n\n## contributing\n\nfor guidance on
