  "description": "# g2pkk\nthis is a cross-platform g2p for korean.\n\ng2pkk is a library that made [kyubyong's g2pk](https://github.com/kyubyong/g2pk) work in windows.\nthe reason why g2pk does not work well in windows is that the `mecab`, the morpheme analyzer used by g2pk, causes build errors in windows.\ng2pkk uses a different morpheme analyzer depending on the operating system.\nwindows uses [eunjeon](https://github.com/koshort/pyeunjeon), which enables mecab to be used in windows, and other operating systems use [python-mecab-ko](https://github.com/jonghwanhyeon/python-mecab-ko), which was previously used in g2pk.\n\ninstall g2pkk and make sure that a morpheme analyzer exists for the operating system of the system you are using for the first time, and if not, proceed with the installation automatically.\n\n## requirements\n* python >= 3.6\n* jamo\n* nltk\n\n\n## installation\n```\npip install g2pkk\n```\n\n\n## how to use\ng2pkk uses same syntaxes as g2pk.\n```\n>>> from g2pkk import g2p\n>>> g2p = g2p(\"\ud3ec\uc0c1\uc740 \uc5f4\uc2ec\ud788 \ud55c \uc544\uc774\uc5d0\uac8c\ub9cc \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud3ec\uc0c1\uc778 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\")\n>>> g2p(\"\ud3ec\uc0c1\uc73c \ub148\uc2ec\ud788 \ud558 \ub098\uc774\uc5d0\uac8c\ub9cc \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb34\ub124 \ud3ec\uc0c1\uc778 \uac70\uc2ec\ub2c8\ub2e4.\")\n\n```\nif you want more information, check [g2pk](https://github.com/kyubyong/g2pk)\n\n",
