  "description": "# nfoursid\n\nimplementation of the n4sid algorithm for subspace identification [1], together with kalman filtering and state-space\nmodels.\n\nstate-space models are versatile models for representing multi-dimensional timeseries.\nas an example, the armax(_p_, _q_, _r_)-models - autoregressive movingaverage with exogenous input -\nare included in the representation of state-space models.\nby extension, arma-, ar- and ma-models can be described, too.\nthe numerical implementations are based on [2].\n\n## installation\nreleases are made available on pypi.\nthe recommended installation method is via `pip`:\n\n```python\npip install nfoursid\n```\n\nfor a development setup, the requirements are in `dev-requirements.txt`.\nsubsequently, this repo can be locally `pip`-installed.\n\n## documentation and code example\ndocumentation is provided [here](https://nfoursid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\nan example jupyter notebook is provided [here](https://github.com/spmvg/nfoursid/blob/master/examples/overview.ipynb).\n\n## references\n\n1. van overschee, peter, and bart de moor. \"n4sid: subspace algorithms for the identification of combined\n   deterministic-stochastic systems.\" automatica 30.1 (1994): 75-93.\n2. verhaegen, michel, and vincent verdult. _filtering and system identification: a least squares approach._\n   cambridge university press, 2007.\n",
