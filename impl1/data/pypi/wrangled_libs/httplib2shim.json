  "description": "httplib2shim\n============\n\n|build status| |coverage status| |pypi version|\n\n``httplib2shim`` is a wrapper over ``httplib2`` that uses ``urllib3`` to perform http requests. this library is intended to help existing legacy libraries (and their users) to migrate away from ``httplib2``. it is not intended to be a general purpose replacement for ``httplib2``. it does not support every feature and edge case for ``httplib2``, although contributions are welcome in order to help us cover these cases.\n\npresently, ``httplib2shim`` passes the test suite for ``httplib2``. a few non-applicable tests were disabled, and it's very possible that the tests do not account for behavior that is depended on by clients.\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nit's recommended to install ``urllib3[secure]`` before installing ``httplib2shim``:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install urllib3[secure] httplib2shim\n\nusage is straightforward. you can substitute ``httplib2shim.http`` anywhere ``httplib2.http`` is used:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import httplib2shim\n    from oauth2client.client import googlecredentials\n\n\n    credentials = googlecredentials.get_application_default()\n    http = httplib2shim.http()\n    credentials.authorize(http)\n\n    # http is now authorized with oauth2 credentials and uses urllib3 under\n    # the covers.\n\n\nalternatively, if you do not control the construction of the ``http`` object, you can use ``httplib2shim.patch()`` to monkey-patch the ``httplib2.http`` class to point to ``httplib2shim.http()``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import httplib2shim\n    httplib2shim.patch()\n\n    from googleapiclient.discovery import build\n    from oauth2client.client import googlecredentials\n\n    credentials = googlecredentials.get_application_default()\n\n    # build constructs its own httplib2.http instance.\n    service = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)\n\n    # service.http is now a httplib2shim.http object.\n\nunsupported features\n--------------------\n\n* arguments to the `http` constructor will be accepted, but may not make a difference. for instance, ``ca_certs`` will have no effect. instead, pass a ``urllib3.pool`` instance ``http = httplib2shim.http(pool=my_pool)``.\n* `http.add_certificate` is a no-op and will warn.\n* probably others, pull requests are welcome to complete the functionality.\n\n\ncontributing changes\n--------------------\n\n-  see `contributing.md`_\n\nlicensing\n---------\n\n- mit - see `license`_\n\n.. _license: https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/httplib2shim/blob/master/license\n.. _contributing.md: https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/httplib2shim/blob/master/contributing.md\n\n.. |build status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/googlecloudplatform/httplib2shim.svg\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/googlecloudplatform/httplib2shim\n.. |coverage status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/googlecloudplatform/httplib2shim/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/googlecloudplatform/httplib2shim?branch=master\n.. |pypi version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/httplib2shim.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/httplib2shim",
