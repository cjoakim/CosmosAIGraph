  "description": "intel\u00ae oneapi math kernel library (intel\u00ae onemkl) is a computing math library of highly optimized, extensively threaded routines for applications that require maximum performance. this package provides c and data parallel c++ (dpc++) programming language interfaces. intel mkl c language interfaces can be called from applications written in either c or c++, as well as in any other language that can reference a c interface. use it to optimize code for current and future generations of intel\u00ae cpus and gpus.\n\n",
