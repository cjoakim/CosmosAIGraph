  "description": "**this version is only relevant for python 3.3, which does not include asyncio in its stdlib.**\r\n\r\nmaster repo: https://github.com/python/asyncio\r\n\r\nthe asyncio module provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded\r\nconcurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing i/o access over sockets and\r\nother resources, running network clients and servers, and other related\r\nprimitives.  here is a more detailed list of the package contents:\r\n\r\n* a pluggable event loop with various system-specific implementations;\r\n\r\n* transport and protocol abstractions (similar to those in twisted);\r\n\r\n* concrete support for tcp, udp, ssl, subprocess pipes, delayed calls, and\r\n  others (some may be system-dependent);\r\n\r\n* a future class that mimics the one in the concurrent.futures module, but\r\n  adapted for use with the event loop;\r\n\r\n* coroutines and tasks based on ``yield from`` (pep 380), to help write\r\n  concurrent code in a sequential fashion;\r\n\r\n* cancellation support for futures and coroutines;\r\n\r\n* synchronization primitives for use between coroutines in a single thread,\r\n  mimicking those in the threading module;\r\n\r\n* an interface for passing work off to a threadpool, for times when you\r\n  absolutely, positively have to use a library that makes blocking i/o calls.\r\n\r\nnote: the implementation of asyncio was previously called \"tulip\".\r\n\r\n\r\ninstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nto install asyncio, type::\r\n\r\n    pip install asyncio\r\n\r\nasyncio requires python 3.3 or later! the asyncio module is part of the python\r\nstandard library since python 3.4.\r\n\r\nasyncio is a free software distributed under the apache license version 2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nwebsites\r\n========\r\n\r\n* `asyncio project at github <https://github.com/python/asyncio>`_: source\r\n  code, bug tracker\r\n* `asyncio documentation <https://docs.python.org/dev/library/asyncio.html>`_\r\n* mailing list: `python-tulip google group\r\n  <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/python-tulip>`_\r\n* irc: join the ``#asyncio`` channel on the freenode network\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment\r\n===========\r\n\r\nthe actual code lives in the 'asyncio' subdirectory. tests are in the 'tests'\r\nsubdirectory.\r\n\r\nto run tests, run::\r\n\r\n    tox\r\n\r\nor use the makefile::\r\n\r\n    make test\r\n\r\nto run coverage (coverage package is required)::\r\n\r\n    make coverage\r\n\r\non windows, things are a little more complicated.  assume 'p' is your\r\npython binary (for example c:\\python33\\python.exe).\r\n\r\nyou must first build the _overlapped.pyd extension and have it placed\r\nin the asyncio directory, as follows:\r\n\r\n    c> p setup.py build_ext --inplace\r\n\r\nif this complains about vcvars.bat, you probably don't have the\r\nrequired version of visual studio installed.  compiling extensions for\r\npython 3.3 requires microsoft visual c++ 2010 (msvc 10.0) of any\r\nedition; you can download visual studio express 2010 for free from\r\nhttp://www.visualstudio.com/downloads (scroll down to visual c++ 2010\r\nexpress).\r\n\r\nonce you have built the _overlapped.pyd extension successfully you can\r\nrun the tests as follows:\r\n\r\n    c> p runtests.py\r\n\r\nand coverage as follows:\r\n\r\n    c> p runtests.py --coverage",
