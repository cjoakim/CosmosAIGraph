in case this plugin is not installed\n        pytest_header_modules = {}\n        tested_versions = {}\n\n    # this really depends on how you set up your package version,\n    # modify as needed.\n    from mypackage import __version__ as version\n\n    def pytest_configure(config):\n        config.option.astropy_header = true  # if you do not have it in setup.cfg\n        pytest_header_modules.pop('pandas')\n        pytest_header_modules['scikit-image'] = 'skimage'\n        tested_versions['mypackage'] = version\n\nthe key to ``pytest_header_modules`` should be the name that will be displayed\nin the header, and the value should be the name of the python module.\n\nif you would like to append other text to the end of the header, you can do this\nby implementing your own ``pytest_report_header()`` function in the\n``conftest.py`` file in your package. for example, to add a custom footer to the\nend of the astropy header, you could define::\n\n    def pytest_report_header(config):\n        footer = (\"this is some custom text that will appear after the \"\n                  \"astropy pytest header!\")\n        return footer + \"\\n\"\n\n\nmigrating from the astropy header plugin to pytest-astropy-header\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**note: pytest-astropy-header no longer supports astropy<4.\nthis section is only kept for historical reason.**\n\nbefore the v4.0 release of the core astropy package, the plugin that handles the\nheader of the testing output described above lived in\n``astropy.tests.plugins.display``. a few steps are now needed to update packages\nto make sure that only the pytest-astropy-header version is used instead. these should\nbe done in addition to the configuration mentioned in the previous section.\n\nfirst, you should be able to significantly simplify the ``conftest.py`` file by\nreplacing e.g.::\n\n    from astropy.version import version as astropy_version\n    if astropy_version < '3.0':\n        # with older versions of astropy, we actually need to import the pytest\n        # plugins themselves in order to make them discoverable by pytest.\n        from astropy.tests.pytest_plugins import *\n    else:\n        # as of astropy 3.0, the pytest plugins provided by astropy are\n        # automatically made available when astropy is installed. this means it's\n        # not necessary to import them here, but we still need to import global\n        # variables that are used for configuration.\n        from astropy.tests.plugins.display import (pytest_report_header,\n                                                   pytest_header_modules,\n                                                   tested_versions)\n\n    # customize the following lines to add/remove entries from\n    # the list of packages for which version numbers are displayed when running\n    # the tests. making it pass for keyerror is essential in some cases when\n    # the package uses other astropy affiliated packages.\n    try:\n        pytest_header_modules['astropy'] = 'astropy'\n        del pytest_header_modules['h5py']\n    except keyerror:\n        pass\n\n    # this is to figure out the package version, rather than\n    # using astropy's\n    from .version import version, astropy_helpers_version\n\n    packagename = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n    tested_versions[packagename] = version\n    tested_versions['astropy_helpers'] = astropy_helpers_version\n\nwith e.g.::\n\n    import os\n\n    from astropy.version import version as astropy_version\n    if astropy_version < '3.0':\n        from astropy.tests.pytest_plugins import *\n        del pytest_report_header\n    else:\n        from pytest_astropy_header.display import pytest_header_modules, tested_versions\n\n\n    def pytest_configure(config):\n\n        config.option.astropy_header = true\n\n        pytest_header_modules.pop('pandas', none)\n        pytest_header_modules['scikit-image'] = 'skimage'\n\n        from .version import version, astropy_helpers_version\n        packagename = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n        tested_versions[packagename] = version\n        tested_versions['astropy_helpers'] = astropy_helpers_version\n\nnote that while you will need to use a recent version of pytest-astropy for this\nto work, it should work with astropy 2.0 onwards without requiring all the\n``try...except`` for imports.\n\nnext check all of your ``conftest.py`` files and be sure to remove the old\nplugin from lists such as::\n\n    pytest_plugins = [\n      'astropy.tests.plugins.display',\n    ]\n\ndevelopment status\n------------------\n\nquestions, bug reports, and feature requests can be submitted on `github`_.\n\n.. _github: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nthis package is licensed under a 3-clause bsd style license - see the\n``license.rst`` file.\n",
