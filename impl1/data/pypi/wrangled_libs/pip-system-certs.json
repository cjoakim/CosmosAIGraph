  "description": "================\npip-system-certs\n================\n\nthis package patches pip and requests at runtime to use certificates from the default system store (rather than the bundled certs ca).\n\nthis will allow pip to verify tls/ssl connections to servers who's cert is trusted by your system install.\n\nsimply install with::\n\n  pip install pip_system_certs\n\nand pip should trust your https sites if your host os does.\n\nthis also extends to all direct uses of the requests library (and other packages that use requests)\n\npyinstaller\n-----------\nthe method used to automatically enable the cert handling in requests/pip/etc relies on a ``.pth``\nfile script that python loads at startup. this method does not work when a python application is\nbundled into an executable with pyinstaller (or similar).\n\nif you want to use this tool in an application built with pyinstaller it will need to be manually\nenabled in your application.\n\nthis can be done by adding the following line to the top of your main application script::\n\n    import pip_system_certs.wrapt_requests\n\nthis must be run before ``requests`` is imported.\n\nacknowledgements\n----------------\nthe method of patching at runtime is built from the autowrapt module: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autowrapt\n\n\nversion: 4.0\n",
