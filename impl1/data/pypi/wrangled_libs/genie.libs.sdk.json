  "description": "genie libs sdk component\n========================\n\ngenie is both a library framework and a test harness that facilitates rapid\ndevelopment, encourage re-usable and simplify writing test automation. genie\nbundled with the modular architecture of pyats framework accelerates and\nsimplifies test automation leveraging all the perks of the python programming\nlanguage in an object-orienting fashion.\n\npyats is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and\nreusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for agile, rapid development\niterations. extensible by design, pyats enables developers start with small,\nsimple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous\ntest suites.\n\ngenie was initially developed internally in cisco, and is now available to the\ngeneral public starting early 2018 through `cisco devnet`_. visit the genie\nhome page at\n\n    https://developer.cisco.com/site/pyats/\n\n.. _cisco devnet: https://developer.cisco.com/\n\n\nops libs package\n----------------\n\nthis is the library sub-component of genie for `genie.sdk`. contains all the\ntriggers and verifications.\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\ngenie currently supports python 3.4+ on linux & mac systems. windows platforms\nare not yet supported.\n\nquick start\n-----------\n\n.. code-block:: console\n    \n    # install genie as a whole\n    $ pip install genie\n\n    # to upgrade this package manually\n    $ pip install --upgrade genie.libs.sdk\n\n    # to install alpha/beta versions, add --pre\n    $ pip install --pre genie.libs.sdk\n\n    \n\nfor more information on setting up your python development environment,\nsuch as creating virtual environment and installing ``pip`` on your system, \nplease refer to `virtual environment and packages`_ in python tutorials.\n\n.. _virtual environment and packages: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html\n",
