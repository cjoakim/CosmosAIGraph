  "description": "bloom-filter\n============\n\na pure python bloom filter (low storage requirement, probabilistic\nset datastructure) is provided.  it is known to work on cpython 3.x, pypy,\nand jython.\n\nincludes mmap, in-memory and disk-seek backends.\n\nthis project builds on `drs-bloom-filter` and `bloom_filter_mod`.\ncredits and links can be found in authors.md.\n\nusage\n-----\n\nthe user specifies the desired maximum number of elements and the\ndesired maximum false positive probability, and the module\ncalculates the rest.\n\n::\n\n    from bloom_filter2 import bloomfilter\n\n    # instantiate bloomfilter with custom settings,\n    # max_elements is how many elements you expect the filter to hold.\n    # error_rate defines accuracy; you can use defaults with\n    # `bloomfilter()` without any arguments. following example\n    # is same as defaults:\n    bloom = bloomfilter(max_elements=10000, error_rate=0.1)\n\n    # test whether the bloom-filter has seen a key:\n    assert \"test-key\" not in bloom\n\n    # mark the key as seen\n    bloom.add(\"test-key\")\n\n    # now check again\n    assert \"test-key\" in bloom",
