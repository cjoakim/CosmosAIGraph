  "description": "nose of yeti\n============\n\nthis is a project creates a custom python ``codec`` that lets the developer write\ntheir tests using an `rspec <https://rspec.info>`_ inspired dsl (i.e. ``describe``\nand ``it`` blocks).\n\nit uses the fact that python allows the registration of a\n`codec <http://docs.python.org/library/codecs.html>`_ that can be used\nto read in source code and modify it at import time.\n\nnoseofyeti uses this technique to find files with a particular coding declaration\non the first line of a file to turn the rspec inspired dsl into ordinary python\nthat is then executed as if it were written like that in the first place.\n\nthe original idea comes from `@fmeyer <https://github.com/fmeyer>`_ who wrote this\n`blog post <https://web.archive.org/web/20120405004819/http://fmeyer.org/en/writing-a-dsl-with-python.html>`_\nand a simple `proof of concept <https://github.com/fmeyer/pydsl>`_ before it was\npicked up and worked on by `@hltbra <https://github.com/hltbra>`_\nin `this repo <https://github.com/fmeyer/yeti>`_.\n\n`@delfick <https://github.com/delfick>`_ discovered this work in 2010 and over the\nfollowing decade plus has improved on the concept, giving it more features and\nintegration with python tooling.\n\nthe documentation can be found at http://noseofyeti.readthedocs.io and the code\nover at https://github.com/delfick/nose-of-yeti.\n\nupdating nose-of-yeti version\n-----------------------------\n\nit is recommended any .pyc files are removed when noseofyeti is upgraded.\n\nthe python interpreter skips the translation process if it\nsees a .pyc file (unless the .py file has changed since the .pyc file was\ncreated). this means that any changes in the translation process won't apply\nuntil either the .pyc files are removed or all the .py files have been changed.\n",
