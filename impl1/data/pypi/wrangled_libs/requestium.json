status](https://travis-ci.org/tryolabs/requestium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tryolabs/requestium)\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-bsd%203--clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-3-clause)\n\nrequestium is a python library that merges the power of [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests), [selenium](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium), and [parsel](https://github.com/scrapy/parsel) into a single integrated tool for automatizing web actions.\n\nthe library was created for writing web automation scripts that are written using mostly requests but that are able to seamlessly switch to selenium for the javascript heavy parts of the website, while maintaining the session.\n\nrequestium adds independent improvements to both requests and selenium, and every new feature is lazily evaluated, so its useful even if writing scripts that use only requests or selenium.\n\nread more about the motivation behind creating this library in this [blopost](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2017/11/22/requestium-integration-layer-requests-selenium-web-automation/).\n\n## features\n- enables switching between a requests' session and a selenium webdriver while maintaining the current web session.\n- integrates parsel's parser into the library, making xpath, css, and regex much cleaner to write.\n- improves selenium's handling of dynamically loading elements.\n- makes cookie handling more flexible in selenium.\n- makes clicking elements in selenium more reliable.\n- supports chromedriver natively plus adding a custom webdriver.\n\n## installation\n```bash\npip install requestium\n```\n\nyou should then download your preferred selenium webdriver if you plan to use the selenium part of requestium, such as [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).\n\n## usage\nfirst create a session as you would do on requests, and optionally add arguments for the web-driver if you plan to use one.\n```python\nfrom requestium import session, keys\n\noptions = {'arguments': ['headless']}\ns = session(webdriver_path='./chromedriver', default_timeout=15, webdriver_options=options)\n```\n\nsince headless mode is common, there's a shortcut for it by pecifying `headless=true`.\n\n```python\nfrom requestium import session, keys\n\ns = session(webdriver_path='./chromedriver' headless=true)\n```\n\nyou can also create a selenium webdriver outside requestium and have it use that instead:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom requestium import session, keys\n\nfirefox_driver = webdriver.firefox()\n\ns = session(driver=firefox_driver)\n```\n\nyou can also specify a 3rd party chrome webdriver class and use it by specifying the `browser` argument as well. this will allow, for example, to use [selenium-wire](https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire) to get xhr requests of a web page:\n\n```python\nfrom seleniumwire import webdriver\nfrom requestium import session, keys\n\nseleniumwire_driver = webdriver.chrome()\n\ns = session(webdriver_path='./chromedriver', driver=seleniumwire_driver)\n\n```\n\nyou don't need to parse the response, it is done automatically when calling xpath, css or re.\n```python\ntitle = s.get('http://samplesite.com').xpath('//title/text()').extract_first(default='default title')\n```\n\nregex require less boilerplate when compared to python's standard `re` module.\n```python\nresponse = s.get('http://samplesite.com/sample_path')\n\n# extracts the first match\nidentifier = response.re_first(r'id_\\d\\w\\d', default='id_1a1')\n\n# extracts all matches as a list\nusers = response.re(r'user_\\d\\d\\d')\n```\n\nthe session object is just a regular requests's session object, so you can use all of its methods.\n```python\ns.post('http://www.samplesite.com/sample', data={'field1': 'data1'})\ns.proxies.update({'http': 'http://10.11.4.254:3128', 'https': 'https://10.11.4.252:3128'})\n```\n\nand you can switch to using the selenium webdriver to run any js code.\n```python\ns.transfer_session_cookies_to_driver()  # you can maintain the session if needed\ns.driver.get('http://www.samplesite.com/sample/process')\n```\n\nthe driver object is a selenium webdriver object, so you can use any of the normal selenium methods plus new methods added by requestium.\n```python\ns.driver.find_element_by_xpath(\"//input[@class='user_name']\").send_keys('james bond', keys.enter)\n\n# new method which waits for element to load instead of failing, useful for single page web apps\ns.driver.ensure_element_by_xpath(\"//div[@attribute='button']\").click()\n```\n\nrequestium also adds xpath, css, and re methods to the selenium driver object.\n```python\nif s.driver.re(r'id_\\d\\w\\d some_pattern'):\n    print('found it!')\n```\n\nand finally you can switch back to using requests.\n```python\ns.transfer_driver_cookies_to_session()\ns.post('http://www.samplesite.com/sample2', data={'key1': 'value1'})\n```\n\n## selenium workarounds\nrequestium adds several 'ensure' methods to the driver object, as selenium is known to be very finicky about selecting elements and cookie handling.\n\n### wait for element\nthe `ensure_element_by_` methods waits for the element to be loaded in the browser and returns it as soon as it loads. it's named after selenium's `find_element_by_` methods (which immediately raise an exception if they can't find the element).\n\nrequestium can wait for an element to be in any of the following states:\n- present (default)\n- clickable\n- visible\n- invisible (useful for things like waiting for *loading...* gifs to disappear)\n\nthese methods are very useful for single page web apps where the site is dynamically changing its elements. we usually end up completely replacing our `find_element_by_` calls with `ensure_element_by_` calls as they are more flexible.\n\nelements you get using these methods have the new `ensure_click` method which makes the click less prone to failure. this helps with getting through a lot of the problems with selenium clicking.\n\n```python\ns.driver.ensure_element_by_xpath(\"//li[@class='b1']\", state='clickable', timeout=5).ensure_click()\n\n# === we also added these methods named in accordance to selenium's api design ===\n# ensure_element_by_id\n# ensure_element_by_name\n# ensure_element_by_link_text\n# ensure_element_by_partial_link_text\n# ensure_element_by_tag_name\n# ensure_element_by_class_name\n# ensure_element_by_css_selector\n```\n\n### add cookie\nthe `ensure_add_cookie` method makes adding cookies much more robust. selenium needs the browser to be at the cookie's domain before being able to add the cookie, this method offers several workarounds for this. if the browser is not in the cookies domain, it gets the domain before adding the cookie. it also allows you to override the domain before adding it, and avoid making this get. the domain can be overridden to `''`, this sets the cookie's domain to whatever domain the driver is currently in.\n\nif it can't add the cookie it tries to add it with a less restrictive domain (eg.: home.site.com -> site.com) before failing.\n\n```python\ncookie = {\"domain\": \"www.site.com\",\n          \"secure\": false,\n          \"value\": \"sd2451dgd13\",\n          \"expiry\": 1516824855.759154,\n          \"path\": \"/\",\n          \"httponly\": true,\n          \"name\": \"sessionid\"}\ns.driver.ensure_add_cookie(cookie, override_domain='')\n```\n\n## considerations\nnew features are lazily evaluated, meaning:\n- the selenium webdriver process is only started if you call the driver object. so if you don't need to use the webdriver, you could use the library with no overhead. very useful if you just want to use the library for its integration with parsel.\n- parsing of the responses is only done if you call the `xpath`, `css`, or `re` methods of the response. so again there is no overhead if you don't need to use this feature.\n\na byproduct of this is that the selenium webdriver could be used just as a tool to ease in the development of regular requests code: you can start writing your script using just the requests' session, and at the last step of the script (the one you are currently working on) transfer the session to the chrome webdriver. this way, a chrome process starts in your machine, and acts as a real time \"visor\" for the last step of your code. you can see in what state your session is currently in, inspect it with chrome's excellent inspect tools, and decide what's the next step your session object should take. very useful to try code in an ipython interpreter and see how the site reacts in real time.\n\nwhen `transfer_driver_cookies_to_session` is called, requestium automatically updates your requests session user-agent to match that of the browser used in selenium. this doesn't happen when running requests without having switched from a selenium session first though. so if you just want to run requests but want it to use your browser's user agent instead of the default one (which sites love to block), just run:\n```python\ns.copy_user_agent_from_driver()\n```\ntake into account that doing this will launch a browser process.\n\nnote: the selenium chrome webdriver doesn't support automatic transfer of proxies from the session to the webdriver at the moment.\n\n## comparison with requests + selenium + lxml\na silly working example of a script that runs on reddit. we'll then show how it compares to using requests + selenium + lxml instead of requestium.\n\n### using requestium\n```python\nfrom requestium import session, keys\n\n# if you want requestium to type your username in the browser for you, write it in here:\nreddit_user_name = ''\n\ns = session('./chromedriver', default_timeout=15)\ns.driver.get('http://reddit.com')\ns.driver.find_element_by_xpath(\"//a[@href='https://www.reddit.com/login']\").click()\n\nprint('waiting for elements to load...')\ns.driver.ensure_element_by_class_name(\"desktop-onboarding-sign-up__form-toggler\",\n\t\t\t\t      state='visible').click()\n\nif reddit_user_name:\n    s.driver.ensure_element_by_id('user_login').send_keys(reddit_user_name)\n    s.driver.ensure_element_by_id('passwd_login').send_keys(keys.backspace)\nprint('please log-in in the chrome browser')\n\ns.driver.ensure_element_by_class_name(\"desktop-onboarding__title\", timeout=60, state='invisible')\nprint('thanks!')\n\nif not reddit_user_name:\n    reddit_user_name = s.driver.xpath(\"//span[@class='user']//text()\").extract_first()\n\nif reddit_user_name:\n    s.transfer_driver_cookies_to_session()\n    response = s.get(\"https://www.reddit.com/user/{}/\".format(reddit_user_name))\n    cmnt_karma = response.xpath(\"//span[@class='karma comment-karma']//text()\").extract_first()\n    reddit_golds_given = response.re_first(r\"(\\d+) gildings given out\")\n    print(\"comment karma: {}\".format(cmnt_karma))\n    print(\"reddit golds given: {}\".format(reddit_golds_given))\nelse:\n    print(\"couldn't get user name\")\n```\n\n### using requests + selenium + lxml\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom lxml import etree\nfrom requests import session\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom

drop-in replacement of requests' session object, with added functionality. if your use case is a drop in replacement for a selenium webdriver, but that also has some of requests' functionality, [selenium-requests](https://github.com/cryzed/selenium-requests) does just that.\n\n\n## license\ncopyright \u00a9 2018, [tryolabs](https://tryolabs.com/). released under the [bsd
