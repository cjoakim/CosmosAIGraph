  "description": "py2neo\n======\n\n** **please now consider this project to be eol. there will be no more updates. it is recommended to use the official neo4j drivers instead.** **\n\nthe version history of py2neo on pypi got lost.\nif you need an older version, you can install [`py2neo-history`](https://pypi.org/project/py2neo-history/) instead.\n\n.. image::

:alt: license\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/neo4j-contrib/py2neo/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/neo4j-contrib/py2neo?branch=master\n   :alt: coverage status\n\n\n**py2neo** is a client library and toolkit for working with `neo4j <https://neo4j.com/>`_ from within `python <https://www.python.org/>`_ applications.\nthe library supports both bolt and http and provides a high level api, an ogm, admin tools, a cypher lexer for pygments, and many other bells and whistles.\n\ncommand line tooling has been removed from the library in py2neo 2021.2.\nthis functionality now exists in the separate **ipy2neo** project.\n\nas of version 2021.1, py2neo contains full support for routing, as exposed by a neo4j cluster.\nthis can be enabled using a ``neo4j://...`` uri or by passing ``routing=true`` to a ``graph`` constructor.\n\n\ninstallation & compatibility\n----------------------------\n\nto install the latest release of py2neo, simply use:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install py2neo\n\nthe following versions of python and neo4j (all editions) are supported:\n\n.. list-table::\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - neo4j\n      - python 3.5+\n      - python 2.7\n    * - 4.4\n      - |test-neo44-py35+|\n      - |test-neo44-py27|\n    * - 4.3\n      - |test-neo43-py35+|\n      - |test-neo43-py27|\n    * - 4.2\n      - |test-neo42-py35+|\n      - |test-neo42-py27|\n    * - 4.1\n      - |test-neo41-py35+|\n      - |test-neo41-py27|\n    * - 4.0\n      - |test-neo40-py35+|\n      - |test-neo40-py27|\n    * - 3.5\n      - |test-neo35-py35+|\n      - |test-neo35-py27|\n    * - 3.4\n      - |test-neo34-py35+|\n      - |test-neo34-py27|\n\nnote that py2neo is developed and tested under **linux** using standard cpython distributions.\nwhile other operating systems and python distributions may work, support for these is not available.\n\n\nquick example\n-------------\n\nto run a query against a local database is straightforward::\n\n    >>> from py2neo import graph\n    >>> graph = graph(\"bolt://localhost:7687\", auth=(\"neo4j\", \"password\"))\n    >>> graph.run(\"unwind range(1, 3) as n return n, n * n as n_sq\")\n       n | n_sq\n    -----|------\n       1 |    1\n       2 |    4\n       3 |    9\n\n\nreleases & versioning\n---------------------\n\nas of 2020, py2neo has switched to `calendar versioning <https://calver.org/>`_, using a scheme of ``yyyy.n.m``.\nhere, ``n`` is an incrementing zero-based number for each year, and ``m`` is a revision within that version (also zero-based).\n\nno compatibility guarantees are given between versions, but as a general rule, a change in ``m`` should require little-to-no work within client applications,\nwhereas a change in ``n`` may require some work. a change to the year is likely to require a more significant amount of work to upgrade.\n\nnote that py2neo is developed on a rolling basis, so patches are not made to old versions.\nusers will instead need to install the latest release to adopt bug fixes.\n\n\nmore\n----\n\nfor more information, read the `handbook <http://py2neo.org/>`_.\n\n\n.. |test-neo44-py27|
