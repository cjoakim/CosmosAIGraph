  "description": "quick and dirty lib for submitting jobs to slurm via python2/python3.\n\n```python\nfrom slurmpy import slurm\n\ns = slurm(\"job-name\", {\"account\": \"my-account\", \"partition\": \"my-parition\"})\ns.run(\"\"\"\ndo\nlots\nof\nstuff\n\"\"\")\n\n```\n\nthe above will submit the job to `sbatch` automatically write the script to `scripts/`\nand automatically write logs/{name}.err and logs/{name}.out. it will have today's\ndate in the log and script names.\n\nthe script to run() can also contain `$variables` which are filled with the cmd_kwarg dict.\ne.g. `echo $name` could be filled with `cmd_kwargs={'name': 'sally'}`\n\na command can be tested (not sent to queue) by setting the `_cmd` are to `run` as e.g. \"ls\".\nthe default is `sbatch` which submits jobs to slurm.\n\ndependencies\n============\n\neach time `slurmpy.slurm().run()` is called, it returns the job-id of the submitted job. this\ncan then be sent to a subsequent job:\n```\ns = slurm()\ns.run(..., depends_on=[job_id])\n\n```\nto indicate that this job should not run until the the job with `job_id` has finished successfully.\n\ninstall\n=======\n\n```shell\npip install slurmpy --user\n```",
