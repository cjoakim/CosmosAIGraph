  "description": "`mako <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_ bindings for pyramid\n============================================================\n\nthese are bindings for the `mako templating system <https://www.makotemplates.org/>`_ for the `pyramid <https://trypyramid.com/>`_ web framework.\n\ndocumentation for `pyramid_mako <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid-mako/en/latest/>`_.\n\n\n1.1.0 (2019-08-18)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7.\n\n- require ``mako >= 1.1.0``.\n\n- add a config option for ``preprocessor_wants_settings``. if set to ``true``,\n  the ``preprocessor`` will be wrapped in a function that invokes the \n  preprocessor with pyramid's config settings as the second argument.\n\n1.0.2 (2014-04-22)\n==================\n\n- fix mako.imports so that aslist() does not flatten. see issue #23\n  (https://github.com/pylons/pyramid_mako/issues/23)\n\n1.0.1 (2014-04-16)\n==================\n\n- bump the required version of mako to 0.8 or newer for issue #22 (add\n  future_imports). if you would like to use an older version of mako, please\n  pin your dependency to version 0.3.1 of pyramid_mako.\n\n1.0 (2014-04-15)\n================\n\n- add new configuration variable for future_imports. see issue #22\n  (https://github.com/pylons/pyramid_mako/issues/22)\n- fix issue #19, whereby pyramid.reload_templates stopped functioning due to\n  changes in pyramid_mako. the lookup is now completed at template render,\n  instead of when the factory returns the renderer. see:\n  (https://github.com/pylons/pyramid_mako/issues/19)\n- tuple return values in the form of ('defname', {}) are no longer supported,\n  and will result in a valueerror being raised.\n- fix an packaging issue whereby \\*.foo files were not included in the manifest.\n- caller-relative template lookup is now supported. any template that fails\n  to be found in the default search paths will be searched relative to the\n  caller package.\n- allow overriding the ``pyramid.reload_templates`` using\n  ``mako.reload_templates``.\n- change the way that custom user values passed to the renderer are merged with\n  the system provided variables. this allows the user to pass in a variable\n  named 'context' and have it correctly override the system provided context,\n  and then get correctly renamed so that mako doesn't complain about a variable\n  being passed in that isn't allowed due to it being reserved.\n- drop testing dependency on ``nose-selecttests``.\n\n0.3.1 (2013-10-22)\n==================\n\n- re-enable lazy loading of the mako renderer, allowing the settings\n  to be configured after pyramid_mako has been included, as long as everything\n  happens in the same commit.\n\n0.3 (2013-10-20)\n================\n\n- add a new configurator directive, ``config.add_mako_renderer`` which\n  can be used to add a new mako renderer for a given extension. this\n  directive accepts an optional ``settings_prefix`` to load settings and\n  configuration differently per-renderer as well.\n\n- removed the private apis, ``imakolookup``, ``makorendererfactoryhelper``,\n  and ``renderer_factory``. see the new ``config.add_mako_renderer`` api\n  for updating offending code.\n\n- remove dependency on ``pyramid.interfaces.itemplaterenderer`` from\n  pyramid 1.5.\n\n0.2 (2013-09-07)\n================\n\n- docs up-to-date\n- latest changes pulled from pyramid\n- latest tests pulled from pyramid\n- all tests updated to refer to fixtures in pyramid_mako\n\n0.1 (2012-03-12)\n================\n\n- first release. extracted from pyramid core.\n\n\n\n",
