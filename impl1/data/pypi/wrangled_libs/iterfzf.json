  "description": "``iterfzf``: pythonic interface to ``fzf``\n==========================================\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/iterfzf\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/iterfzf/\n   :alt: latest pypi version\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/dahlia/iterfzf/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg\n   :alt: build status (github actions)\n   :target: https://github.com/dahlia/iterfzf/actions/workflows/test.yaml\n\n\ndemo session\n------------\n\n.. image:: https://asciinema.org/a/121028.png\n   :target: https://asciinema.org/a/121028\n   :alt: iterfzf demo session\n\nsee also the `api reference`_.\n\n\nkey features\n------------\n\n- no dependency but only python is required.  prebuilt ``fzf`` binary for\n  each platform is bundled into wheels.  everything is ready by\n  ``pip install iterfzf``.  (note that not wheels of all supported platforms\n  are uploaded to pypi as they don't allow minor platforms e.g. freebsd.\n  the complete wheels can be found from the `github releases`__.)\n- consumes an iterable rather than a list.  it makes ux way better when the\n  input data is long but *streamed* from low latency network.\n  it can begin to display items immediately after only *part* of items are\n  ready, and *before* the complete items are ready.\n- supports python 3.8 or higher.\n\n__ https://github.com/dahlia/iterfzf/releases\n\n\n.. _api reference:\n\n``iterfzf.iterfzf(iterable, *, **options)``\n-------------------------------------------\n\nconsumes the given ``iterable`` of strings, and displays them using ``fzf``.\nif a user chooses something it immediately returns the chosen things.\n\nthe following is the full list of parameters.  pass them as\n**keyword arguments** except for ``iterable`` which comes first:\n\n``iterable`` (required)\n   the only required parameter.  every element which this ``iterable`` yields\n   is displayed immediately after each one is produced.  in other words,\n   the passed ``iterable`` is lazily consumed.\n\n   it can be an iterable of byte strings (e.g. ``[b'foo', b'bar']``) or of\n   unicode strings (e.g. ``[u'foo', u'bar']``), but must not be\n   mixed (e.g. ``[u'foo', b'bar']``).  if they are byte strings the function\n   returns bytes.  if they are unicode strings it returns unicode strings.\n   see also the ``encoding`` parameter.\n\n``multi``\n   ``true`` to let the user to choose more than one.  a user can select\n   items with tab/shift-tab.  if ``multi=true`` the function returns a list of\n   strings rather than a string.\n\n   ``false`` to make a user possible to choose only one.  if ``multi=false``\n   it returns a string rather than a list.\n\n   for both modes, the function returns ``none`` if nothing is matched or\n   a user cancelled.\n\n   ``false`` by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``-m``/``--multi`` option.\n\n``print_query``\n   if ``true`` the return type is a tuple where the first element is the query\n   the user actually typed, and the second element is the selected output as\n   described above and depending on the state of ``multi``.\n\n   ``false`` by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``--print-query`` option.\n\n   *new in version 0.3.0.*\n\n``encoding``\n   the text encoding name (e.g. ``'utf-8'``, ``'ascii'``) to be used for\n   encoding ``iterable`` values and decoding return values.  it's ignored\n   when the ``iterable`` values are byte strings.\n\n   the python's default encoding (i.e. ``sys.getdefaultencoding()``) is used\n   by default.\n\n``extended``\n   ``true`` for extended-search mode.  ``false`` to turn it off.\n\n   ``true`` by default.\n\n   ``true`` corresponds to ``-x``/``--extended`` option, and\n   ``false`` corresponds to ``+x``/``--no-extended`` option.\n\n``exact``\n   ``false`` for fuzzy matching, and ``true`` for exact matching.\n\n   ``false`` by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``-e``/``--exact`` option.\n\n``case_sensitive``\n   ``true`` for case sensitivity, and ``false`` for case insensitivity.\n   ``none``, the default, for smart-case match.\n\n   ``true`` corresponds to ``+i`` option and ``false`` corresponds to\n   ``-i`` option.\n\n``query``\n   the query string to be filled at first.  (it can be removed by a user.)\n\n   empty string by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``-q``/``--query`` option.\n\n``prompt``\n   the prompt sequence.  ``' >'`` by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``--prompt`` option.\n\n``preview``\n   the preview command to execute.  ``none`` by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``--preview`` option.\n\n``mouse``\n   ``false`` to disable mouse.  ``true`` by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``--no-mouse`` option.\n\n``ansi``\n   ``true`` to enable ansi colors mode. ``none`` by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``--ansi`` option.\n\n``cycle``\n   ``true`` to enable cycling scrolling.\n\n   ``false`` by default.\n\n   corresponds to ``--cycle`` option.\n\n``__extra__``\n    the iterable of extra raw options/arguments to pass to ``fzf``.\n\n    empty by default.\n\n\n\nauthor and license\n------------------\n\nthe ``iterfzf`` library is written by `hong minhee`__ and distributed under\ngplv3_ or later.\n\nthe ``fzf`` program is written by `junegunn choi`__ and distributed under\nmit license.\n\n__ https://hongminhee.org/\n.. _gplv3: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html\n__ https://junegunn.kr/\n\n\nchangelog\n---------\n\nversioning scheme\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nnote that ``iterfzf`` does *not* follow `semantic versioning`_.  the version\nconsists of its own major and minor number followed by the version of bundled\n``fzf``.  for example, 1.2.3.4.5 means that ``iterfzf``'s own major version\nis 1, and its own minor version is 2, plus the version of ``fzf`` it bundles\nis 3.4.5.\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n   /---------- 1. iterfzf's major version\n   |   /------ 3. bundled fzf's major version\n   |   |   /-- 5. bundled fzf's patch version\n   |   |   |\n   v   v   v\n   1.2.3.4.5\n     ^   ^\n     |   |\n     |   \\---- 4. bundled fzf's minor version\n     \\-------- 2. iterfzf's minor version\n\n.. _semantic versioning: http://semver.org/\n\n\nversion 1.1.0.44.0\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nreleased on november 18, 2023.  bundles ``fzf`` `0.44.0`__.\n\n- added ``cycle`` option.

(note that it's always been the recommended way to pass\n  options, although it was not enforced.)\n- added ``ansi`` option.  [`#16`__ by erik lilja]\n- the ``executable`` parameter now takes ``os.pathlike`` instead of ``str``,\n  which is backward compatible.\n- added ``__version__`` and ``__fzf_version__`` attributes to the module.\n- added ``posix_executable_name`` and ``windows_executable_name`` attributes\n  to the module.\n- module attribute ``executable_name`` is now a ``literal['fzf', 'fzf.exe']``\n  type, which is backward compatible with the previous ``str`` type.\n- module attribute ``bundled_executable`` is now ``optional[pathlib.path]``\n  type.\n\n__ https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/0.42.0\n__ https://github.com/dahlia/iterfzf/pull/16\n\n\nversion 0.5.0.20.0\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nreleased on february 9, 2020.  bundles ``fzf`` 0.20.0.\n\n- dropped python 2.6, 3.3, and 3.4 supports.\n- officially support python 3.7 (it anyway had worked though).\n- marked the package as supporting type checking by following `pep 561`_.\n- added ``preview`` option.
