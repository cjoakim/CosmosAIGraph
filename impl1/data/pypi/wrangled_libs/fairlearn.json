  "description": "|mit license| |pypi| |discord| |stackoverflow|\n\nfairlearn\n=========\n\nfairlearn is a python package that empowers developers of artificial\nintelligence (ai) systems to assess their system's fairness and mitigate\nany observed unfairness issues. fairlearn contains mitigation algorithms\nas well as metrics for model assessment. besides the source code, this\nrepository also contains jupyter notebooks with examples of fairlearn\nusage.\n\nwebsite: https://fairlearn.org/\n\n-  `current release <#current-release>`__\n-  `what we mean by *fairness*

current stable release is available on\n   `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/fairlearn/>`__.\n\n-  our current version may differ substantially from earlier versions.\n   users of earlier versions should visit our\n   `version guide <https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/installation_and_version_guide/version_guide.html>`_\n   to navigate significant changes and find information on how to migrate.\n\nwhat we mean by *fairness*\n--------------------------\n\nan ai system can behave unfairly for a variety of reasons. in fairlearn,\nwe define whether an ai system is behaving unfairly in terms of its\nimpact on people \u2013 i.e., in terms of harms. we focus on two kinds of\nharms:\n\n-  *allocation harms.* these harms can occur when ai systems extend or\n   withhold opportunities, resources, or information. some of the key\n   applications are in hiring, school admissions, and lending.\n\n-  *quality-of-service harms.* quality of service refers to whether a\n   system works as well for one person as it does for another, even if\n   no opportunities, resources, or information are extended or withheld.\n\nwe follow the approach known as **group fairness**, which asks: *which\ngroups of individuals are at risk for experiencing harms?* the relevant\ngroups need to be specified by the data scientist and are application\nspecific.\n\ngroup fairness is formalized by a set of constraints, which require that\nsome aspect (or aspects) of the ai system's behavior be comparable\nacross the groups. the fairlearn package enables assessment and\nmitigation of unfairness under several common definitions. to learn more\nabout our definitions of fairness, please visit our\n`user guide on fairness of ai systems <https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/fairness_in_machine_learning.html#fairness-of-ai-systems>`__.\n\n    *note*: fairness is fundamentally a sociotechnical challenge. many\n    aspects of fairness, such as justice and due process, are not\n    captured by quantitative fairness metrics. furthermore, there are\n    many quantitative fairness metrics which cannot all be satisfied\n    simultaneously. our goal is to enable humans to assess different\n    mitigation strategies and then make trade-offs appropriate to their\n    scenario.\n\noverview of fairlearn\n---------------------\n\nthe fairlearn python package has two components:\n\n-  *metrics* for assessing which groups are negatively impacted by a\n   model, and for comparing multiple models in terms of various fairness\n   and accuracy metrics.\n\n-  *algorithms* for mitigating unfairness in a variety of ai tasks and\n   along a variety of fairness definitions.\n\nfairlearn
