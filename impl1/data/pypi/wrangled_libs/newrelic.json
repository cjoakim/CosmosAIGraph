(this is useful if you're using ``mod_wsgi``.)\n\n   .. code:: python\n\n      import newrelic.agent\n      newrelic.agent.initialize('/path/to/newrelic.ini')\n\n4. start or restart your python web application or wsgi server.\n\n5. done! check your application in the `new relic ui`_ to see the real time statistics generated from your application.\n\n.. _python agent quick start: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-quick-start\n.. _license key: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key\n.. _wrapper script: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#wrapper-script\n.. _manually integrate the agent: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#manual-integration\n.. _new relic ui: https://rpm.newrelic.com\n\nadditional resources may be found here:\n\n* `new relic for python documentation <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent>`_\n* `new relic for python release notes <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes>`_\n\nsupport\n-------\n\nshould you need assistance with new relic products, you are in good hands with several support diagnostic tools and support channels.\n\nthis `troubleshooting framework <https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/troubleshooting-frameworks/108787>`_ steps you through common troubleshooting questions.\n\nnew relic offers nrdiag, `a client-side diagnostic utility <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics>`_ that automatically detects common problems with new relic agents. if nrdiag detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. nrdiag can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a new relic support ticket.\n\nif the issue has been confirmed as a bug or is a feature request, please file a github issue.\n\nsupport channels\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* `new relic documentation <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent>`_: comprehensive guidance for using our platform\n* `new relic community <https://discuss.newrelic.com/c/support-products-agents/python-agent>`_: the best place to engage in troubleshooting questions\n* `new relic developer <https://developer.newrelic.com/>`_: resources for building a custom observability applications\n* `new relic university <https://learn.newrelic.com/>`_: a range of online training for new relic users of every level\n* `new relic technical support <https://support.newrelic.com/>`_ 24/7/365 ticketed support. read more about our `technical support offerings <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/support-plan>`_.\n\nprivacy\n-------\n\nat new relic we take your privacy and the security of your information seriously, and are committed to protecting your information. we must emphasize the importance of not sharing personal data in public forums, and ask all users to scrub logs and diagnostic information for sensitive information, whether personal, proprietary, or otherwise.\n\nwe define \"personal data\" as any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, including, for example, your name, phone number, post code or zip code, device id, ip address and email address.\n\nplease review `new relic's general data privacy notice <https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy>`_ for more information.\n\nproduct roadmap\n---------------\n\nsee our `roadmap <./roadmap.md>`_, to learn more about our product vision, understand our plans, and provide us valuable feedback.\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\nwe encourage your contributions to improve the new relic python agent!
