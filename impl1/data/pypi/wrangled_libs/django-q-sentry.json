  "description": "\n# django-q-sentry\n\na [django q](https://github.com/koed00/django-q/) error reporter plugin adding sentry support.\n# before version 0.1.3 sentry raven was a dependency. after 0.1.3 sentry-sdk used as raven is being deprecated.\n\n### installation\n\nthis plugin is intended to be included with django q as [setuptools extra](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies).\n\n`$ pip install django-q[sentry]`\n\nor add `django-q[sentry]` to `requirements.txt`.\n\n> this plugin requires django q version 0.8.1 or greater.\n\n### usage\n\nconfigure sentry via the django q `q_cluster` dictionary in your django project's `settings.py`. it is important that the `sentry` key be set in the `error_reporter` dictionary, as this name aligns with the project's entry point for this plugin. the only required configuration entry is your sentry dsn.\n```python\nq_cluster = {\n    'error_reporter': {\n        'sentry': {\n            'dsn': 'https://******@sentry.io/<project>'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nplease check the [python sentry client configuration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/python/) for more options. additional key-value pairs defined in `q_cluster['error_reporter']['sentry']` are passed directly as kwargs to instantiation of [`raven.client`](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/python/#configuring-the-client).\n\n\n",
