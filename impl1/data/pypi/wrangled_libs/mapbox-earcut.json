  "description": "# mapbox_earcut\n\npython bindings for the c++ implementation of the mapbox earcut library, which\nprovides very fast and quite robust triangulation of 2d polygons.\n\noriginal code: [earcut.hpp](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp)\n\noriginal description:\n\n> the library implements a modified ear slicing algorithm, optimized by\n> [z-order curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/z-order_curve) hashing and\n> extended to handle holes, twisted polygons, degeneracies and self-intersections\n> in a way that doesn't _guarantee_ correctness of triangulation, but attempts to\n> always produce acceptable results for practical data like geographical shapes.\n\nprovided functions (depending on dtype of vertex data):\n```python\ntriangulate_float32\ntriangulate_float64\ntriangulate_int32\ntriangulate_int64\n```\n\nexample:\n```python\n\nimport mapbox_earcut as earcut\nimport numpy as np\n\n# a nx2 array of vertices. must be 2d.\nverts = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1]]).reshape(-1, 2)\n\n# an array of end-indices for each ring.\n# the first ring is the outer contour of the polygon.\n# subsequent ones are holes.\n# this implies that the last index must always be equal to the size of verts!\nrings = np.array([3])\n\nresult = earcut.triangulate_float32(verts, rings)\n\n# result is an np.ndarray with dtype np.uint32 and shape (3,)\n# containing indices into the verts array.\n\nprint(verts[result])\n# [[1 0]\n#  [1 1]\n#  [0 0]]\n```\n",
