  "description": "# jupyterlab-execute-time\n\n[![pypi version][pypi-image]][pypi-url] [![pypi dm][pypi-dm-image]][pypi-url]\n[![github actions status][github-status-image]][github-status-url] [![binder][binder-image]][binder-url]\n\ndisplay cell timings in jupyter lab\n\n![execute time screenshot](https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-execute-time/blob/master/docs/execute-time-screenshot.png?raw=true)\n\nthis is inspired by the notebook version [here](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/blob/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/execute_time).\n\n## requirements\n\n- jupyterlab >= 3.0\n\n## install\n\nto install this package with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) run\n\n```bash\npip install jupyterlab_execute_time\n```\n\nto install this package with [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) run\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab_execute_time\n```\n\nnote: by default, if this extension is enabled, it will automatically change your settings to record timing in the notebook metadata when it is loaded. if this fails, you can do this manually via settings->advanced settings editor->notebook: `{\"recordtiming\": true}`. this is a notebook metadata setting and not a plugin setting. the plugin just displays this data.\n\n## contributing\n\n### development install\n\nnote: you will need nodejs to build the extension package.\n\nthe `jlpm` command is jupyterlab's pinned version of\n[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with jupyterlab. you may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# clone the repo to your local environment\n# change directory to the jupyterlab_execute_time directory\n# install package in development mode\npip install -e .\n# link your development version of the extension with jupyterlab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n# rebuild extension typescript source after making changes\njlpm run build\n```\n\nyou can watch the source directory and run jupyterlab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm run watch\n# run jupyterlab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nwith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running jupyterlab. refresh jupyterlab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\nby default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. to also generate source maps for the jupyterlab core extensions, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab build --minimize=false\n```\n\n#### publishing\n\nbefore starting, you'll need to have run: `pip install twine jupyter_packaging`\n\n1. update the version in `package.json` and update the release date in `changelog.md`\n2. commit the change in step 1, tag it, then push it\n\n```\ngit commit -am <msg>\ngit tag vx.z.y\ngit push && git push --tags\n```\n\n3. create the artifacts\n\n```\nrm -rf dist build jupyterlab_execute_time/labextension\njlpm run build\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\n4. test this against the test pypi. you can then install from here to test as well:\n\n```\ntwine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*\n# in a new venv\npip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ jupyterlab_execute_time\n```\n\n5. upload this to pypi:\n\n```\ntwine upload dist/*\n```\n\n### uninstall\n\n```bash\npip uninstall jupyterlab_execute_time\n```\n\n## history\n\nthis plugin was contributed back to the community by the [d. e. shaw group](https://www.deshaw.com/).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.deshaw.com\">\n       <img src=\"https://www.deshaw.com/assets/logos/blue_logo_417x125.png\" alt=\"d. e. shaw logo\" height=\"75\" >\n    </a>\n</p>\n\n## license\n\nthis project is released under a [bsd-3-clause license](https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-execute-time/blob/master/license.txt).\n\nwe love contributions!
