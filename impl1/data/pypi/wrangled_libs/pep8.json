(issue #180)\n\n* when both a ``tox.ini`` and a ``setup.cfg`` are present in the project\n  directory, merge their contents.  the ``tox.ini`` file takes\n  precedence (same as before). (issue #182)\n\n* give priority to ``--select`` over ``--ignore``. (issue #188)\n\n* compare full path when excluding a file. (issue #186)\n\n* new option ``--hang-closing`` to switch to the alternative style of\n  closing bracket indentation for hanging indent.  add error e133 for\n  closing bracket which is missing indentation.

(issue #201 and #208)\n\n* fix false positive e121 with multiple brackets. (issue #203)\n\n\n1.4.5 (2013-03-06)\n------------------\n\n* when no path is specified, do not try to read from stdin.  the feature\n  was added in 1.4.3, but it is not supported on windows.  use ``-``\n  filename argument to read from stdin.  this usage is supported\n  since 1.3.4. (issue #170)\n\n* do not require ``setuptools`` in setup.py.  it works around an issue\n  with ``pip`` and python 3. (issue #172)\n\n* add ``__pycache__`` to the ignore list.\n\n* change misleading message for e251. (issue #171)\n\n* do not report false e302 when the source file has a coding cookie or a\n  comment on the first line. (issue #174)\n\n* reorganize the tests and add tests for the api and for the command line\n  usage and options. (issues #161 and #162)\n\n* ignore all checks which are not explicitly selected when ``select`` is\n  passed to the ``styleguide`` constructor.\n\n\n1.4.4 (2013-02-24)\n------------------\n\n* report e227 or e228 instead of e225 for whitespace around bitwise, shift\n  or modulo operators.

(issue #160)\n\n* read from standard input if no path is specified.\n\n* initiate a graceful shutdown on ``control+c``.\n\n* allow to change the ``checker_class`` for the ``styleguide``.\n\n\n1.4.2 (2013-02-10)\n------------------\n\n* support ast checkers provided by third-party applications.\n\n* register new checkers with ``register_check(func_or_cls, codes)``.\n\n* allow to construct a ``styleguide`` with a custom parser.\n\n* accept visual indentation without parenthesis after the ``if``\n  statement. (issue #151)\n\n* fix unboundlocalerror when using ``# noqa`` with continued lines.\n  (issue #158)\n\n* re-order the lines for the ``standardreport``.\n\n* expand tabs when checking e12 continuation lines. (issue #155)\n\n* refactor the testing class ``testreport`` and the specific test\n  functions into a separate test module.\n\n\n1.4.1 (2013-01-18)\n------------------\n\n* allow sphinx.ext.autodoc syntax for comments. (issue #110)\n\n* report e703 instead of e702 for the trailing semicolon. (issue #117)\n\n* honor ``# noqa`` in addition to ``# nopep8``. (issue #149)\n\n* expose the ``optionparser`` factory for better extensibility.\n\n\n1.4 (2012-12-22)\n----------------\n\n* report e226 instead of e225 for optional whitespace around common\n  operators (``*``, ``**``, ``/``, ``+`` and ``-``).  this new error\n  code is ignored in the default configuration because pep 8 recommends\n  to \"use your own judgement\". (issue #96)\n\n* lines with a ``# nopep8`` at the end will not issue errors on line\n  length e501 or continuation line indentation e12*. (issue #27)\n\n* fix assertionerror when the source file contains an invalid line\n  ending ``\"\\r\\r\\n\"``. (issue #119)\n\n* read the ``[pep8]`` section of ``tox.ini`` or ``setup.cfg`` if present.\n  (issue #93 and #141)\n\n* add the sphinx-based documentation, and publish it\n  on http://pep8.readthedocs.org/.

(issue #82)\n\n* do not read the user configuration when used as a module\n  (except if ``config_file=true`` is passed to the ``styleguide`` constructor).\n\n* fix wrong or missing cases for the e12 series.\n\n* fix cases where e122 was missed. (issue #81)\n\n\n1.3 (2012-06-15)\n----------------\n\n.. warning::\n   the internal api is backwards incompatible.\n\n* remove global configuration and refactor the library around\n  a ``styleguide`` class; add the ability to configure various\n  reporters. (issue #35 and #66)\n\n* read user configuration from ``~/.config/pep8``\n  and local configuration from ``./.pep8``. (issue #22)\n\n* fix e502 for backslash embedded in multi-line string. (issue #68)\n\n* fix e225 for python 3 iterable unpacking (pep 3132). (issue #72)\n\n* enable the new checkers from the e12 series in the default\n  configuration.\n\n* suggest less error-prone alternatives for e712 errors.\n\n* rewrite checkers to run faster (e22, e251, e27).\n\n* fixed a crash when parsed code is invalid (too many\n  closing brackets).\n\n* fix e127 and e128 for continuation line indentation. (issue #74)\n\n* new option ``--format`` to customize the error format. (issue #23)\n\n* new option ``--diff`` to check only modified code.  the unified\n  diff is read from stdin.  example: ``hg diff | pep8 --diff``\n  (issue #39)\n\n* correctly report the count of failures and set the exit code to 1\n  when the ``--doctest`` or the ``--testsuite`` fails.\n\n* correctly detect the encoding in python 3. (issue #69)\n\n* drop support for python 2.3, 2.4 and 3.0. (issue #78)\n\n\n1.2 (2012-06-01)\n----------------\n\n* add e121 through e128 for continuation line indentation.  these\n  checks are disabled by default.  if you want to force all checks,\n  use switch ``--select=e,w``.  patch by sam vilain. (issue #64)\n\n* add e721 for direct type comparisons. (issue #47)\n\n* add e711 and e712 for comparisons to singletons. (issue #46)\n\n* fix spurious e225 and e701 for function annotations. (issue #29)\n\n* add e502 for explicit line join between brackets.\n\n* fix e901 when printing source with ``--show-source``.\n\n* report all errors for each checker, instead of reporting only the\n  first occurrence for each line.\n\n* option ``--show-pep8`` implies ``--first``.\n\n\n1.1 (2012-05-24)\n----------------\n\n* add e901 for syntax errors. (issues #63 and #30)\n\n* add e271, e272, e273 and e274 for extraneous whitespace around\n  keywords. (issue #57)\n\n* add ``tox.ini`` configuration file for tests.

(issue #53)\n\n\n0.7.0 (2012-03-26)\n------------------\n\n* now ``--first`` prints only the first occurrence of each error.\n  the ``--repeat`` flag becomes obsolete because it is the default\n  behaviour. (issue #6)\n\n* allow to specify ``--max-line-length``. (issue #36)\n\n* make the shebang more flexible. (issue #26)\n\n* add testsuite to the bundle. (issue #25)\n\n* fixes for jython. (issue #49)\n\n* add pypi classifiers. (issue #43)\n\n* fix the ``--exclude`` option. (issue #48)\n\n* fix w602, accept ``raise`` with 3 arguments.

(issue #21)\n\n\n0.6.0 (2010-09-19)\n------------------\n\n* test suite reorganized and enhanced in order to check more failures\n  with fewer test files.  read the ``run_tests`` docstring for details\n  about the syntax.\n\n* fix e225: accept ``print >>sys.stderr, \"...\"`` syntax.\n\n* fix e501 for lines containing multibyte encoded characters. (issue #7)\n\n* fix e221, e222, e223, e224 not detected in some cases. (issue #16)\n\n* fix e211 to reject ``v = dic['a'] ['b']``. (issue #17)\n\n* exit code is always 1 if any error or warning is found. (issue #10)\n\n* ``--ignore`` checks are now really ignored, especially in\n  conjunction with ``--count``. (issue #8)\n\n* blank lines with spaces yield w293 instead of w291: some developers\n  want to ignore this warning and indent the blank lines to paste their\n  code easily in the python interpreter.\n\n* fix e301: do not require a blank line before an indented block. (issue #14)\n\n* fix e203 to accept numpy slice notation ``a[0, :]``. (issue #13)\n\n* performance improvements.\n\n* fix decoding and checking non-utf8 files in python 3.\n\n* fix e225: reject ``true+false`` when running on python 3.\n\n* fix an exception when the line starts with an operator.\n\n* allow a new line before closing ``)``, ``}`` or ``]``. (issue #5)\n\n\n0.5.0 (2010-02-17)\n------------------\n\n* changed the ``--count`` switch to print to sys.stderr and set\n  exit code to 1 if any error or warning is found.\n\n* e241 and e242 are removed from the standard checks. if you want to\n  include these checks, use switch ``--select=e,w``. (issue #4)\n\n* blank line is not mandatory before the first class method or nested\n  function definition, even if there's a docstring. (issue #1)\n\n* add the switch ``--version``.\n\n* fix decoding errors with python 3. (issue #13 [1]_)\n\n* add ``--select`` option which is mirror of ``--ignore``.\n\n* add checks e261 and e262 for spaces before inline comments.\n\n* new check w604 warns about deprecated usage of backticks.\n\n* new check w603 warns about the deprecated operator ``<>``.\n\n* performance improvement, due to rewriting of e225.\n\n* e225 now accepts:\n\n  - no whitespace after unary operator or similar. (issue #9 [1]_)\n\n  - lambda function with argument unpacking or keyword defaults.\n\n* reserve \"2 blank lines\" for module-level logical blocks. (e303)\n\n* allow multi-line comments.
