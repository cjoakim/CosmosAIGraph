filesystem-like resources you want.\n\nthe backend is built on top of [pyfilesystem](https://github.com/pyfilesystem/pyfilesystem2), while the frontend is built on top of [jupyterlab filetree](https://github.com/youngthejames/jupyterlab_filetree).\n\n\n## install\n\n```bash\npip install jupyter-fs\n```\n\n\n## configure\n\nadd the following to your `jupyter_server_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"serverapp\": {\n    \"contents_manager_class\": \"jupyterfs.metamanager.metamanager\",\n    \"jpserver_extensions\": {\n      \"jupyterfs.extension\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## simple use (no auth/credentials)\n\nadd specifications for additional contents managers in your user settings (in the **settings** menu under **advanced settings editor** -> **jupyter-fs**). here's an example config that sets up several new filebrowsers side-by-side:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"resources\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"root at test dir\",\n      \"url\": \"osfs:///users/foo/test\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"s3 test bucket\",\n      \"url\": \"s3://test\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"s3 test key\",\n      \"url\": \"s3://test-2/prefix/\",\n      \"defaultwritable\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"samba guest share\",\n      \"url\": \"smb://guest@127.0.0.1/test?name-port=3669\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nyou should see your new filebrowsers pop up in the left-hand sidebar instantly when you save your settings:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpmorganchase/jupyter-fs/main/docs/osfs_example.png)\n\n\n## use with auth/credentials\n\nany stretch of a `\"url\"` that is enclosed in double-brackets `{{var}}` will be treated as a template, and will be handled by jupyter-fs's auth system. for example, you can pass a username/password to the `\"samba guest share\"` resource in the `simple use` example above by modifying its `\"url\"` like so:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"resources\": [\n    ...\n\n    {\n      \"name\": \"samba share\",\n      \"url\": \"smb://{{user}}:{{passwd}}@127.0.0.1/test?name-port=3669\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nwhen you save the above `\"resouces\"` config, a dialog box will pop asking for the `username` and `passwd` values:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpmorganchase/jupyter-fs/main/docs/remote_example.png)\n\nonce you enter those values and hit ok, the new filebrowsers will then immediately appear in the sidebar:\n\n\n## the auth dialog will only appear when needed\n\nthe jupyter-fs auth dialog will only appear when:\n- jupyterlab first loads, if any fs resources reqiure auth\n- a new fs resouce is added that requires auth, or its `\"url\"` field is modified\n\n\n## supported filesystems\n\nthe type of resource each filebrowser will point to is determined by the protocol at the start of its url:\n\n- **osfs**: **os** **f**ile**s**ystem. the will open a new view of your local filesystem, with the specified root\n- **s3**: opens a filesystem pointing to an amazon s3 bucket\n- **smb**: opens a filesystem pointing to a samba share\n\njupyter-fs can open a filebrowser pointing to any of the diverse [resources supported by pyfilesystem](). currently, we test only test the s3 and smb/samba backends as part of our ci, so your milleage may vary with the other pyfilesystem backends.\n\n\n## the filesystem url\n\nthe `\"url\"` field jupyter-fs config is based on the pyfilesystem [opener url](https://docs.pyfilesystem.org/en/latest/openers.html) standard. for more info on how to write these urls, see the documentation of the relevant pyfilesystem plugin:\n- s3: [s3fs docs](https://fs-s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- smb: [fs.smbfs docs](https://github.com/althonos/fs.smbfs#usage)\n\n\n## server-side settings\n\nif you prefer to set up your filesystem resources in the server-side config, you can do so. for example, you can set up a local filesystem by adding the following to your `jupyter_server_config.py` file:\n\n```python\nc.jupyterfs.resources = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"local_test\",\n        \"url\": \"osfs:///users/foo/test\"\n    },\n]\n```\n\nalternatively, you can add resource specifications alongside the basic jupyter-fs config in your `jupyter_server_config.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"serverapp\": {\n    \"contents_manager_class\": \"jupyterfs.metamanager.metamanager\",\n    \"jpserver_extensions\": {\n      \"jupyterfs.extension\": true\n    }\n  },\n  \"jupyterfs\": {\n    \"resources\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"local_test\",\n        \"url\": \"osfs:///users/foo/test\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nany filesystem resources specified in any server-side config file will be merged with the resources given in a user's settings.\n\n\n## development\n\nsee
