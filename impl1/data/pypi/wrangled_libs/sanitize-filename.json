  "description": "a simple, dependency-free, blacklist-based filename sanitizer, for when you want to keep the original filename.\n\nnote that a blacklist based sanitizer will _never_ be as safe as a whitelist based one. in most cases, your best option is to create a safe filename yourself. your second safest option is to use a whitelist approach (allowing only certain characters). this sanitizer is useful when you want to keep the original filename, including non ascii characters, whenever possible.\n\n## installation\n\n```sh\npip install sanitize_filename\n```\n\n## usage\n\n```python3\nfrom sanitize_filename import sanitize\n\n\nfilename = input(\"enter a file name:\")\nfilename = sanitize(filename)\n```\n\nexamples:\n\n```python3\n> sanitize(\"a/b/c.txt\")\n'abc.txt'\n\n> sanitize(\"this\ud80c\udc26filename\u1e1dis\u3042actually...valid.txt\")\n'this\ud80c\udc26filename\u1e1dis\u3042actually...valid.txt'\n\n> sanitize(\"def.\")\n'def'\n\n> sanitize(\"nul\")\n'__nul'\n\n> sanitize(\"..\")\n'__'\n```\n\n## changelog\n\n- 1.2.0\n\n  - get rid of os dependent checks; ensure uniform behaviour\n  - now works on long filenames where the non-extensions part consists of only dots\n\n- 1.1.0\n\n  - try to preserve filename extensions if possible\n\n- 1.0.1\n\n  - first release (as 1.0.1 due to a version number mix-up in 1.0.0)\n\n- 1.0.0-dev3\n\n  - black list low code point characters (<32)\n\n- 1.0.0-dev1\n\n  - first version\n\n",
