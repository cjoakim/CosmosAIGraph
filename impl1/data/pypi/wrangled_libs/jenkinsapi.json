jenkins objects appear to be dict-like, mapping keys (job-names) to\n\t['foo', 'test_jenkinsapi']\n\t>>> j['test_jenkinsapi']\n\t<jenkinsapi.job.job test_jenkinsapi>\n\t>>> j['test_jenkinsapi'].get_last_good_build()\n\t<jenkinsapi.build.build test_jenkinsapi #77>\n\t...\n\nmore examples available on github: https://github.com/pycontribs/jenkinsapi/tree/master/examples\n\ntesting\n-------\n\nif you have installed the test dependencies on your system already, you can run\nthe testsuite with the following command:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    python setup.py test\n\notherwise using a virtualenv is recommended. setuptools will automatically fetch\nmissing test dependencies:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    virtualenv\n    source .venv/bin/active\n    (venv) python setup.py test\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n\n* make sure that you have java_ installed.\n* create virtual environment for development\n* install package in development mode\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    (venv) pip install -e .\n    (venv) pip install -r test-requirements.txt\n\n* make your changes, write tests and check your code\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    (venv) tox\n\n\nproject contributors\n--------------------\n\n* aleksey maksimov (ctpeko3a@gmail.com)\n* salim fadhley (sal@stodge.org)\n* ramon van alteren (ramon@vanalteren.nl)\n* ruslan lutsenko (ruslan.lutcenko@gmail.com)\n* cleber j santos (cleber@simplesconsultoria.com.br)\n* william zhang (jollychang@douban.com)\n* victor garcia (bravejolie@gmail.com)\n* bradley harris (bradley@ninelb.com)\n* kyle rockman (kyle.rockman@mac.com)\n* sascha peilicke (saschpe@gmx.de)\n* david johansen (david@makewhat.is)\n* misha behersky (bmwant@gmail.com)\n\nplease do not contact these contributors directly for support questions! use the github tracker instead.\n\nlicense\n--------\n\nthe mit license (mit): permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"software\"), to deal in the software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nthe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nthe software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. in no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n.. _java: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html\n",
