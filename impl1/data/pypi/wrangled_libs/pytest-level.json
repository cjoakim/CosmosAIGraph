  "description": "# pytest-level\n\nmark test cases with a *level*, then de-select tests with a given level or higher.\n\nwhen giving a teaching/practice assignment with pre-written tests, either all\ntests can be given at once (leaving students overwhelmed and unsure which\nfailures should be fixed next), or piece-wise (in individual files -- which\nbecomes a mess for larger projects).\n\nwith this plugin, tests for a teaching/practice assignment can be given in\na single file. students are then told to run with `--level 1`, fix the few red\ntests, then go to `--level 2`, etc.\nunlike with keywords, all the lower-level tests will still be run:\n`--level 2` will run both `level(1)` and `level(2)` tests.\n\n\n## installation\n\nin a python environment (e.g. `venv`), do:\n\n    python -m pip install pytest-level\n\n\n## usage\n\nmark tests with a numeric `level` marker:\n\n    @pytest.mark.level(1)\n    def test_basic_math():\n        assert 1 + 1 == 2\n\n    @pytest.mark.level(2)\n    def test_intermediate_math():\n        assert 10 / 2 == 5\n\n    @pytest.mark.level(3)\n    def test_complicated_math():\n        assert 10 ** 3 == 1000\n\nthen, run pytest with `--level`:\n\n    python -m pytest --level 2\n\nthis will deselect tests of a higher level.\n\nwithout `--level`, all tests are run.\n\n\n## licence\n\nthe code is available under a mit license. may it serve you well.\n\n\n",
