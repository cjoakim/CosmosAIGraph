[development](#development)\n- [releases](#releases)\n- [license](#license)\n\n\n## installation\n\na typical bench setup provides two types of environments &mdash; development and production.\n\nthe setup for each of these installations can be achieved in multiple ways:\n\n - [containerized installation](#containerized-installation)\n - [manual installation](#manual-installation)\n\nwe recommend using docker installation to setup a production environment. for development, you may choose either of the two methods to setup an instance.\n\notherwise, if you are looking to evaluate frappe apps without hassle of hosting, you can try them [on frappecloud.com](https://frappecloud.com/).\n\n\n### containerized installation\n\na frappe/erpnext instance can be setup and replicated easily using [docker](https://docker.com). the officially supported docker installation can be used to setup either of both development and production environments.\n\nto setup either of the environments, you will need to clone the official docker repository:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker.git\n$ cd frappe_docker\n```\n\na quick setup guide for both the environments can be found below. for more details, check out the [frappe/erpnext docker repository](https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker).\n\n### easy install script\n\nthe easy install script should get you going with a frappe/erpnext setup with minimal manual intervention and effort.\n\nthis script uses docker with the [frappe/erpnext docker repository](https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker) and can be used for both development setup and production setup.\n\n#### setup\n\ndownload the easy install script and execute it:\n\n```sh\n$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/bench/develop/easy-install.py\n$ python3 easy-install.py --prod --email your@email.tld\n```\n\nthis script will install docker on your system and will fetch the required containers, setup bench and a default erpnext instance.\n\nthe script will generate mysql root password and an administrator password for the frappe/erpnext instance, which will then be saved under `$home/passwords.txt` of the user used to setup the instance.\nit will also generate a new compose file under `$home/<project-name>-compose.yml`.\n\nwhen the setup is complete, you will be able to access the system at `http://<your-server-ip>`, wherein you can use the administrator password to login.\n\n#### arguments\n\nhere are the arguments for the easy-install script\n\n```txt\nusage: easy-install.py [-h] [-p] [-d] [-s sitename] [-n project] [--email email]\n\ninstall frappe with docker\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help            \t\tshow this help message and exit\n  -p, --prod            \t\tsetup production system\n  -d, --dev             \t\tsetup development system\n  -s sitename, --sitename sitename      the site name for your production site\n  -n project, --project project         project name\n  --email email         \t\tadd email for the ssl.\n```\n\n#### troubleshooting\n\nin case the setup fails, the log file is saved under `$home/easy-install.log`. you may then\n\n- create an issue in this repository with the log file attached.\n\n### manual installation\n\nsome might want to manually setup a bench instance locally for development. to quickly get started on installing bench the hard way, you can follow the guide on [installing bench and the frappe framework](https://frappe.io/docs/user/en/installation).\n\nyou'll have to set up the system dependencies required for setting up a frappe environment. checkout [docs/installation](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/develop/docs/installation.md) for more information on this. if you've already set up, install bench via pip:\n\n\n```sh\n$ pip install frappe-bench\n```\n\n\n## basic usage\n\n**note:** apart from `bench init`, all other bench commands are expected to be run in the respective bench directory.\n\n * create a new bench:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ bench init [bench-name]\n\t```\n\n * add a site under current bench:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ bench new-site [site-name]\n\t```\n\t- **optional**: if the database for the site does not reside on localhost or listens on a custom port, you can use the flags `--db-host` to set a custom host and/or `--db-port` to set a custom port.\n\n\t\t```sh\n\t\t$ bench new-site [site-name] --db-host [custom-db-host-ip] --db-port [custom-db-port]\n\t\t```\n\n * download and add applications to bench:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ bench get-app [app-name] [app-link]\n\t```\n\n * install apps on a particular site\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ bench --site [site-name] install-app [app-name]\n\t```\n\n * start bench (only for development)\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ bench start\n\t```\n\n * show bench help:\n\n\t```sh\n\t$ bench --help\n\t```\n\n\nfor more in-depth information on commands and their usage, follow [commands and usage](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/develop/docs/commands_and_usage.md). as for a consolidated list of bench commands, check out [bench usage](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/develop/docs/bench_usage.md).\n\n\n## custom bench commands\n\nif you wish to extend the capabilities of bench with your own custom frappe application, you may follow [adding custom bench commands](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/develop/docs/bench_custom_cmd.md).\n\n\n## guides\n\n- [configuring

resources](https://frappe.io/docs/user/en/bench/resources).\n\n\n## development\n\nto contribute and develop on the bench cli tool, clone this repo and create an editable install. in editable mode, you may get the following warning everytime you run a bench command:\n\n\twarn: bench is installed in editable mode!\n\n\tthis is not the recommended mode of installation for production. instead, install the package from pypi with: `pip install frappe-bench`\n\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/frappe/bench ~/bench-repo\n$ pip3 install -e ~/bench-repo\n$ bench src\n/users/frappe/bench-repo\n```\n\nto clear up the editable install and switch to a stable version of bench, uninstall via pip and delete the corresponding egg file from the python path.\n\n\n```sh\n# delete bench installed in editable install\n$ rm -r $(find ~ -name '*.egg-info')\n$ pip3 uninstall frappe-bench\n\n# install latest released version of bench\n$ pip3 install -u frappe-bench\n```\n\nto confirm the switch, check the output of `bench src`. it should change from something like `$home/bench-repo` to `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages` and stop the editable install warnings from getting triggered at every command.\n\n\n## releases\n\nbench's version information can be accessed via `bench.version` in the package's __init__.py file. eversince the v5.0 release, we've started publishing releases on github, and pypi.\n\ngithub: https://github.com/frappe/bench/releases\n\npypi: https://pypi.org/project/frappe-bench\n\n\nfrom v5.3.0, we partially automated the release process using [@semantic-release](.github/workflows/release.yml). under this new pipeline, we do the following steps to make a release:\n\n1. merge `develop` into the `staging` branch\n1. merge `staging` into the latest stable branch, which is `v5.x` at this point.\n\nthis triggers a github action job that generates a bump commit, drafts and generates a github release, builds a python package and publishes it to pypi.\n\nthe intermediate `staging` branch exists to mediate the `bench.version` conflict that would arise while merging `develop` and stable. on develop, the version has to be manually updated (for major release changes). the version tag plays a role in deciding when checks have to be made for new bench releases.\n\n> note: we may want to kill the convention of separate branches for different version releases of bench. we don't need to maintain this the way we do for frappe & erpnext. a single branch named `stable` would sustain.\n\n##
