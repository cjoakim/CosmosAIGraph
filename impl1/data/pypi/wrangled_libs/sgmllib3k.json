  "description": "==================================================\nsgmllib3k -- py3k port of the old stdlib module\n==================================================\n\nsgmllib was dropped in python 3. for those depending on it, that's somewhat unfortunate. this is a quick and dirty port of this old module. i just ran 2to3 on it and published it. i don't intend to maintain it, so it might be a good idea to eventually think about finding another module to use.",
