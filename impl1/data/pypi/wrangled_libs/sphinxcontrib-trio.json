  "description": ".. note that this readme gets 'include'ed into the main documentation\n\nsphinxcontrib-trio\n==================\n\nthis sphinx extension helps you document python code that uses\nasync/await, or abstract methods, or context managers, or generators,\nor ... you get the idea. it works by making sphinx's regular\ndirectives for documenting python functions and methods smarter and\nmore powerful. the name is because it was originally written for the\n`trio <https://trio.readthedocs.io>`__ project, and i'm not very\ncreative. but don't be put off \u2013 there's nothing trio- or\nasync-specific about this extension; any python project can\nbenefit. (though projects using async/await probably benefit the most,\nsince sphinx's built-in tools are especially inadequate in this case.)\n\n\nvital statistics\n----------------\n\n**requirements:** this extension currently assumes you're using python\n3.5+ to build your docs. this could be relaxed if anyone wants to send\na patch.\n\n**documentation:** https://sphinxcontrib-trio.readthedocs.io\n\n**bug tracker and source code:**\nhttps://github.com/python-trio/sphinxcontrib-trio\n\n**license:** mit or apache 2, your choice.\n\n**usage:** ``pip install -u sphinxcontrib-trio`` in the same\nenvironment where you installed sphinx, and then add\n``\"sphinxcontrib_trio\"`` to the list of ``extensions`` in your\nproject's ``conf.py``. (notice that ``\"sphinxcontrib_trio\"`` has an\nunderscore in it, not a dot. this is because i don't understand\nnamespace packages, and i fear things that i don't understand.)\n\n**code of conduct:** contributors are requested to follow our `code of\nconduct\n<https://github.com/python-trio/sphinxcontrib-trio/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md>`__\nin all project spaces.\n\n\n",
