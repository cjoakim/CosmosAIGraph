  "description": "requestsexceptions\n==================\n\nthe python requests library bundles the urllib3 library, however, some\nsoftware distributions modify requests to remove the bundled library.\nthis makes some operations, such as supressing the \"insecure platform\nwarning\" messages that urllib emits difficult.  this is a simple\nlibrary to find the correct path to exceptions in the requests library\nregardless of whether they are bundled.\n\n\n\n",
