  "description": "[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/pythological/python-cons.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/pythological/python-cons) [![coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pythological/python-cons/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/pythological/python-cons?branch=main) [![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cons)](https://pypi.org/project/cons/)\n\n# python `cons`\n\nan implementation of [`cons`][cons] in python.\n\n## usage and design\n\nthe `cons` package attempts to emulate the semantics of lisp/scheme's `cons` as closely as possible while incorporating all the built-in python sequence types:\n```python\n>>> from cons import cons, car, cdr\n>>> cons(1, [])\n[1]\n\n>>> cons(1, ())\n(1,)\n\n>>> cons(1, [2, 3])\n[1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nin general, `cons` is designed to work with `collections.abc.sequence` types.\n\naccording to the `cons` package, `none` corresponds to the empty built-in `list`, as `nil` does in some lisps:\n```python\n>>> cons(1, none)\n[1]\n```\n\nthe `cons` package follows scheme-like semantics for empty sequences:\n```python\n>>> car([])\ntraceback (most recent call last):\n  file \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nconserror: not a cons pair\n\n>>> cdr([])\ntraceback (most recent call last):\n  file \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nconserror: not a cons pair\n\n```\n\nby default, `str` types are not considered cons-pairs, although they are sequences:\n```python\n>>> cons(\"a\", \"string\")\nconspair('a' 'a string')\n```\n\nthis setting can be overridden and other types can be similarly excluded from consideration by registering classes with the `abc`-based classes `maybecons` and `noncons`.\n\n\n## features\n\n* built-in support for the standard python ordered sequence types: i.e. `list`, `tuple`, `iterator`, `ordereddict`.\n```python\n>>> from collections import ordereddict\n>>> cons(('a', 1), ordereddict())\nordereddict([('a', 1)])\n\n```\n* existing `cons` behavior can be changed and support for new collections can be added through the generic functions `cons.core._car` and `cons.core._cdr`.\n* built-in support for [`unification`][un].\n```python\n>>> from unification import unify, reify, var\n>>> unify([1, 2], cons(var('car'), var('cdr')), {})\n{~car: 1, ~cdr: [2]}\n\n>>> reify(cons(1, var('cdr')), {var('cdr'): [2, 3]})\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n>>> reify(cons(1, var('cdr')), {var('cdr'): none})\n[1]\n\n```\n\n## installation\n\n```python\npip install cons\n```\n\n### development\n\nfirst obtain the project source:\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:pythological/python-cons.git\n```\n\ncreate a virtual environment and install the development dependencies:\n```bash\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nset up `pre-commit` hooks:\n\n```bash\n$ pre-commit install --install-hooks\n```\n\n[cons]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cons\n[un]: https://github.com/pythological/unification",
