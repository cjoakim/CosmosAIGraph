  "description": "# nltk theme\n\nnltk theme is a [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) theme forked from the wonderful [insegel](https://github.com/autophagy/insegel/), designed for the [nltk](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) documentation. feel free to have a look at the [theme documentation](https://tomaarsen.github.io/nltk_theme) or look at the theme in action over at [www.nltk.org](https://www.nltk.org).\n\n![theme_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37621491/136219826-7e7a2326-8afb-4890-addf-62588f1a14c9.png)\n\n---\n\n### installation\n\nthis theme is not necessarily intended for reuse. i would advise looking at [insegel](https://github.com/autophagy/insegel/) if you'd like to use a similar theme.\n\nthat said, you may install it via pip:\n```\npip install nltk_theme\n```\nthen, you can tell sphinx to use the theme by adding:\n```\nhtml_theme = 'nltk_theme'\n```\nto your project's `conf.py`.\n\n\n",
