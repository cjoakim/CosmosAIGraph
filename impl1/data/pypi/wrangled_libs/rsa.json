  "description": "# pure python rsa implementation\n\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rsa.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/)\n[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa)\n[![coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa?branch=master)\n[![code climate](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a99a88d28ad37a79dbf6/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/codeclimate/codeclimate/maintainability)\n\n[python-rsa](https://stuvel.eu/rsa) is a pure-python rsa implementation. it supports\nencryption and decryption, signing and verifying signatures, and key\ngeneration according to pkcs#1 version 1.5. it can be used as a python\nlibrary as well as on the commandline. the code was mostly written by\nsybren a.  st\u00fcvel.\n\ndocumentation can be found at the [python-rsa homepage](https://stuvel.eu/rsa). for all changes, check [the changelog](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/blob/master/changelog.md).\n\ndownload and install using:\n\n    pip install rsa\n\nor download it from the [python package index](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/).\n\nthe source code is maintained at [github](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/) and is\nlicensed under the [apache license, version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/license-2.0)\n\n## security\n\nbecause of how python internally stores numbers, it is very hard (if not impossible) to make a pure-python program secure against timing attacks. this library is no exception, so use it with care. see https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/ for more info.\n\n## setup of development environment\n\n```\npython3 -m venv .venv\n. ./.venv/bin/activate\npip install poetry\npoetry install\n```\n\n## publishing a new release\n\nsince this project is considered critical on the python package index,\ntwo-factor authentication is required. for uploading packages to pypi, an api\nkey is required; username+password will not work.\n\nfirst, generate an api token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/. then,\nuse this token when publishing instead of your username and password.\n\nas username, use `__token__`.\nas password, use the token itself, including the `pypi-` prefix.\n\nsee https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken for help using api tokens to publish. this\nis what i have in `~/.pypirc`:\n\n```\n[distutils]\nindex-servers =\n    rsa\n\n# use `twine upload -r rsa` to upload with this token.\n[rsa]\n  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/\n  username = __token__\n  password = pypi-token\n```\n\n```\n. ./.venv/bin/activate\npip install twine\n\npoetry build\ntwine check dist/rsa-4.9.tar.gz dist/rsa-4.9-*.whl\ntwine upload -r rsa dist/rsa-4.9.tar.gz dist/rsa-4.9-*.whl\n```\n\nthe `pip install twine` is necessary as python-rsa requires python >= 3.6, and\ntwine requires at least version 3.7. this means poetry refuses to add it as\ndependency.\n\n",
