  "description": "======\nextras\n======\n\nextras is a set of extensions to the python standard library, originally\nwritten to make the code within testtools cleaner, but now split out for\ngeneral use outside of a testing context.\n\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\npydoc extras is your friend. extras currently contains the following functions:\n\n* try_import\n\n* try_imports\n\n* safe_hasattr\n\nwhich do what their name suggests.\n\n\nlicensing\n---------\n\nthis project is distributed under the mit license and copyright is owned by\nthe extras authors. see license for details.\n\n\nrequired dependencies\n---------------------\n\n * python 2.6+ or 3.0+\n\n\nbug reports and patches\n-----------------------\n\nplease report bugs using github issues at <https://github.com/testing-cabal/extras>.\npatches can also be submitted via github.  you can mail the authors directly\nvia the mailing list testtools-dev@lists.launchpad.net. (note that launchpad\ndiscards email from unknown addresses - be sure to sign up for a launchpad\naccount before mailing the list, or your mail will be silently discarded).\n\n\nhistory\n-------\n\nextras used to be testtools.helpers, and was factored out when folk wanted to\nuse it separately.\n\n\nthanks\n------\n\n * martin pool",
