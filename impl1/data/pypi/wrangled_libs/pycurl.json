  "description": "pycurl -- a python interface to the curl library\n================================================\n\npycurl is a python interface to `libcurl`_, the multiprotocol file\ntransfer library. similarly to the urllib_ python module,\npycurl can be used to fetch objects identified by a url from a python program.\nbeyond simple fetches however pycurl exposes most of the functionality of\nlibcurl, including:\n\n- speed - libcurl is very fast and pycurl, being a thin wrapper above\n  libcurl, is very fast as well. pycurl `was benchmarked`_ to be several\n  times faster than requests_.\n- features including multiple protocol support, ssl, authentication and\n  proxy options. pycurl supports most of libcurl's callbacks.\n- multi_ and share_ interfaces.\n- sockets used for network operations, permitting integration of pycurl\n  into the application's i/o loop (e.g., using tornado_).\n\n.. _was benchmarked: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15461995/python-requests-vs-pycurl-performance\n.. _requests: http://python-requests.org/\n.. _multi: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-multi.html\n.. _share: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-share.html\n.. _tornado: http://www.tornadoweb.org/\n\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\n- python 3.5-3.10.\n- libcurl 7.19.0 or better.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\ndownload the source distribution from `pypi`_.\n\nplease see `the installation documentation`_ for installation instructions.\n\n.. _pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycurl\n.. _the installation documentation: http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/install.html\n\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\ndocumentation for the most recent pycurl release is available on\n`pycurl website <http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/>`_.\n\n\nsupport\n-------\n\nfor support questions please use `curl-and-python mailing list`_.\n`mailing list archives`_ are available for your perusal as well.\n\nalthough not an official support venue, `stack overflow`_ has been\npopular with some pycurl users.\n\nbugs can be reported `via github`_. please use github only for bug\nreports and direct questions to our mailing list instead.\n\n.. _curl-and-python mailing list: http://cool.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/curl-and-python\n.. _stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pycurl\n.. _mailing list archives: https://curl.haxx.se/mail/list.cgi?list=curl-and-python\n.. _via github: https://github.com/pycurl/pycurl/issues\n\n\nlicense\n-------\n\npycurl is dual licensed under the lgpl and an mit/x derivative license\nbased on the libcurl license. the complete text of the licenses is available\nin copying-lgpl_ and copying-mit_ files in the source distribution.\n\n.. _libcurl: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/\n.. _urllib: http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html\n.. _copying-lgpl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycurl/pycurl/master/copying-lgpl\n.. _copying-mit: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycurl/pycurl/master/copying-mit\n",
