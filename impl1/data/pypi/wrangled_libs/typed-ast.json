  "description": "===========\nend of life\n===========\n\nthis project is no longer maintained.\n\nuse the standard library `ast` module instead.\nsee https://github.com/python/typed_ast/issues/179.\n\n===========\ndescription\n===========\n\n`typed_ast` is a python 3 package that provides a python 2.7 and python 3\nparser similar to the standard `ast` library.  unlike `ast` below python 3.8,\nthe parsers in\n`typed_ast` include pep 484 type comments and are independent of the version of\npython under which they are run.  the `typed_ast` parsers produce the standard\npython ast (plus type comments), and are both fast and correct, as they are\nbased on the cpython 2.7 and 3.7 parsers.\n\n**note:** the `ast` module of python 3.8+ supports all features of `typed_ast`.\n`typed_ast` does not support parsing code that uses syntax introduced in\npython 3.8 onwards.\nwe recommend using `ast` on python 3.8 or above.\n",
