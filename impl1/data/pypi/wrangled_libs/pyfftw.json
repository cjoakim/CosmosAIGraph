  "description": "\npyfftw is a pythonic wrapper around `fftw <http://www.fftw.org/>`_, the\nspeedy fft library. the ultimate aim is to present a unified interface for all\nthe possible transforms that fftw can perform.\n\nboth the complex dft and the real dft are supported, as well as arbitrary\naxes of arbitrary shaped and strided arrays, which makes it almost\nfeature equivalent to standard and real fft functions of ``numpy.fft``\n(indeed, it supports the ``clongdouble`` dtype which ``numpy.fft`` does not).\n\noperating fftw in multithreaded mode is supported.\n\na comprehensive unittest suite can be found with the source on the github\nrepository.\n\nto build for windows from source, download the fftw dlls for your system\nand the header file from here (they're in a zip file):\nhttp://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html and place them in the pyfftw\ndirectory. the files are libfftw3-3.dll, libfftw3l-3.dll, libfftw3f-3.dll\nand libfftw3.h.\n\nunder linux, to build from source, the fftw library must be installed already.\nthis should probably work for osx, though i've not tried it.\n\nnumpy is a dependency for both.\n\nthe documentation can be found\n`here <http://pyfftw.readthedocs.io>`_, and the source\nis on `github <https://github.com/pyfftw/pyfftw>`_.\n\n\n",
