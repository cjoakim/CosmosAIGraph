  "description": "pyro means python remote objects.\nit is a library that enables you to build applications in which\nobjects can talk to eachother over the network, with minimal programming effort.\nyou can just use normal python method calls, with almost every possible parameter\nand return value type, and pyro takes care of locating the right object on the right\ncomputer to execute the method. it is designed to be very easy to use, and to\ngenerally stay out of your way. but it also provides a set of powerful features that\nenables you to build distributed applications rapidly and effortlessly.\npyro is a pure python library and runs on many different platforms and python versions.\n\nthe source code repository is on github: https://github.com/irmen/pyro4\n\nthe documentation can be found here: http://pyro4.readthedocs.io\n\n\n",
