  "description": "introduction\n------------\n\npyzstd module provides classes and functions for compressing and decompressing data, using facebook's `zstandard <http://www.zstd.net>`_ (or zstd as short name) algorithm.\n\nthe api style is similar to python's bz2/lzma/zlib modules.\n\n* includes zstd v1.5.5 source code\n* can also dynamically link to zstd library provided by system, see `this note <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#build-pyzstd>`_.\n* has a cffi implementation that can work with pypy\n* ``zstdfile`` class has c language level performance\n* supports `zstandard seekable format <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/contrib/seekable_format/zstd_seekable_compression_format.md>`__\n* has a command line interface: ``python -m pyzstd --help``\n\nlinks\n-----------\n\ndocumentation: https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest\n\ngithub: https://github.com/animalize/pyzstd\n\n\nrelease note\n------------\n**0.15.9  (jun 24, 2023)**\n\nzstdfile class related changes:\n\n#. add `seekablezstdfile <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#seekablezstdfile>`_ class, it's a subclass of ``zstdfile``, supports `zstandard seekable format <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/contrib/seekable_format/zstd_seekable_compression_format.md>`__.\n\n#. add *mode* argument to ``zstdfile.flush()`` method, now it can flush a zstd frame.\n\n#. add *read_size* and *write_size* arguments to ``zstdfile.__init__()`` method, can work with network file systems better.\n\n#. optimize ``zstdfile`` performance to c language level.\n\n**0.15.7  (apr 21, 2023)**\n\nzstddict class changes:\n\n#. fix these advanced compression parameters may be ignored when loading a dictionary: ``windowlog``, ``hashlog``, ``chainlog``, ``searchlog``, ``minmatch``, ``targetlength``, ``strategy``, ``enablelongdistancematching``, ``ldmhashlog``, ``ldmminmatch``, ``ldmbucketsizelog``, ``ldmhashratelog``, and some non-public parameters.\n\n#. when compressing, load undigested dictionary instead of digested dictionary by default. loading again an undigested is slower, see `differences <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#zstddict.as_digested_dict>`_.\n\n#. add `.as_prefix <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#zstddict.as_prefix>`_ attribute. can use zstd as a `patching engine <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#patching-engine>`_.\n\n**0.15.6  (apr 5, 2023)**\n\nupgrade zstd source code from v1.5.4 to `v1.5.5 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.5>`_.\n\n**0.15.4  (feb 24, 2023)**\n\n#. upgrade zstd source code from v1.5.2 to `v1.5.4 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.4>`_. v1.5.3 is a non-public release.\n\n#. support ``pyproject.toml`` build mechanism (pep-517). note that specifying build options in old way may be invalid, see `build commands <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#build-pyzstd>`_.\n\n#. support \"multi-phase initialization\" (pep-489) on cpython 3.11+, can work with cpython sub-interpreters in the future. currently this build option is disabled by default.\n\n#. add a command line interface (cli).\n\n**0.15.3  (aug 3, 2022)**\n\nfix ``zstderror`` object can't be pickled.\n\n**0.15.2  (jan 22, 2022)**\n\nupgrade zstd source code from v1.5.1 to `v1.5.2 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.2>`_.\n\n**0.15.1  (dec 25, 2021)**\n\n#. upgrade zstd source code from v1.5.0 to `v1.5.1 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.1>`_.\n\n#. fix ``zstdfile.write()`` / ``train_dict()`` / ``finalize_dict()`` may use wrong length for some buffer protocol objects, see `this issue <https://github.com/animalize/pyzstd/issues/4>`_.\n\n#. two behavior changes:\n\n    * setting ``cparameter.nbworkers`` to ``1`` now means \"1-thread multi-threaded mode\", rather than \"single-threaded mode\".\n\n    * if the underlying zstd library doesn't support multi-threaded compression, no longer automatically fallback to \"single-threaded mode\", now raise a ``zstderror`` exception.\n\n#. add a module level variable `zstd_support_multithread <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#zstd_support_multithread>`_.\n\n#. add a setup.py option ``--avx2``, see `build options <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#build-pyzstd>`_.\n\n**0.15.0  (may 18, 2021)**\n\n#. upgrade zstd source code from v1.4.9 to `v1.5.0 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.0>`_.\n\n#. some improvements, no api changes.\n\n**0.14.4  (mar 24, 2021)**\n\n#. add a cffi implementation that can work with pypy.\n\n#. allow dynamically link to zstd library.\n\n**0.14.3  (mar 4, 2021)**\n\nupgrade zstd source code from v1.4.8 to `v1.4.9 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.4.9>`_.\n\n**0.14.2  (feb 24, 2021)**\n\n#. add two convenient functions: `compress_stream() <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#compress_stream>`_, `decompress_stream() <https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#decompress_stream>`_.\n\n#. some improvements.\n\n**0.14.1  (dec 19, 2020)**\n\n#. upgrade zstd source code from v1.4.5 to `v1.4.8 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.4.8>`_.\n\n    * v1.4.6 is a non-public release for linux kernel.\n\n    * v1.4.8 is a hotfix for `v1.4.7 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.4.7>`_.\n\n#. some improvements, no api changes.\n\n**0.13.0  (nov 7, 2020)**\n\n#. ``zstddecompressor`` class: now it has the same api and behavior as bz2decompressor / lzmadecompressor classes in python standard library, it stops after a frame is decompressed.\n\n#. add an ``endlesszstddecompressor`` class, it accepts multiple concatenated frames. it is renamed from previous ``zstddecompressor`` class, but ``.at_frame_edge`` is ``true`` when both the input and output streams are at a frame edge.\n\n#. rename ``zstd_open()`` function to ``open()``, consistent with python standard library.\n\n#. ``decompress()`` function:\n\n    * ~9% faster when: there is one frame, and the decompressed size was recorded in frame header.\n\n    * raises zstderror when input **or** output data is not at a frame edge. previously, it only raise for output data is not at a frame edge.\n\n**0.12.5  (oct 12, 2020)**\n\nno longer use `argument clinic <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html>`_, now supports python 3.5+, previously 3.7+.\n\n**0.12.4  (oct 7, 2020)**\n\nit seems the api is stable.\n\n**0.2.4  (sep 2, 2020)**\n\nthe first version upload to pypi.\n\nincludes zstd `v1.4.5 <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.4.5>`_ source code.\n",
