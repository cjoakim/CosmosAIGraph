  "description": "# load-dotenv\nenvironment variables are a great and popular way to configure your application.\nalthough the number of such variables can be really high in a big application, making\nit annoying to manage during development.\n\ncommon solution for this issue is usage of `.env` files which contain all variables\nthat should be loaded into your development environment. there are different ways\nto do this, for example handy [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)\npackage. but it should be executed explicitly in order to work. in my projects\ni don't want to add `load_dotenv()` execution in my code that is running on\nproduction, and i'm too lazy to create customer runners for development only.\nthus, i made **load-dotenv** that can do this for me automatically.\n\n## installation\n```shell\npip install load-dotenv\n```\n\n## usage\ncreate `.env` file in your working directory and put your variables there.\nfor details about file format, please refer\n[python-dotenv documentation](https://saurabh-kumar.com/python-dotenv/#file-format).\nrun your application with `load_dotenv` variable set to one of `true`, `yes` or `1`.\n\nalternative path to the file can be specified via `load_dotenv_path` variable.\n",
