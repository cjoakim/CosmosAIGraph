  "description": "# service identity verification for pyopenssl & *cryptography*\n\nuse this package if:\n\n- you want to **verify** that a [pyca *cryptography*](https://cryptography.io/) certificate is valid for a certain hostname or ip address,\n- or if you use [pyopenssl](https://pypi.org/project/pyopenssl/) and don\u2019t want to be [**mitm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-in-the-middle_attack)ed,\n- or if you want to **inspect** certificates from either for service ids.\n\n*service-identity* aspires to give you all the tools you need for verifying whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes.\nin the simplest case, this means *host name verification*.\nhowever, *service-identity* implements [rfc 6125](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125.html) fully.\n\n\n## project information\n\n*service-identity* is released under the [mit](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/blob/main/license) license, its documentation lives at [read the docs](https://service-identity.readthedocs.io/), the code on [github](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity), and the latest release on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/service-identity/).\n\n\n### credits\n\n*service-identity* is written and maintained by [hynek schlawack](https://hynek.me/).\n\nthe development is kindly supported by my employer [variomedia ag](https://www.variomedia.de/), *service-identity*'s [tidelift subscribers][tidelift], and all my amazing [github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).\n\n\n### *service-identity* for enterprise\n\navailable as part of the tidelift subscription.\n\nthe maintainers of *service-identity* and thousands of other packages are working with tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open-source packages you use to build your applications.\nsave time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact packages you use.\n[learn more.][tidelift]\n\n[tidelift]: https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-service-identity?utm_source=pypi-service-identity&utm_medium=readme\n\n\n## release information\n\n### removed\n\n- all python versions up to and including 3.7 have been dropped.\n- support for `commonname` in certificates has been dropped.\n  it has been deprecated since 2017 and isn't supported by any major browser.\n- the oldest supported pyopenssl version (when using the `pyopenssl` backend) is now 17.0.0.\n  when using such an old pyopenssl version, you have to pin *cryptography* yourself to ensure compatibility between them.\n  please check out [`contraints/oldest-pyopenssl.txt`](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/blob/main/tests/constraints/oldest-pyopenssl.txt) to verify what we are testing against.\n\n\n### deprecated\n\n- if you've used `service_identity.(cryptography|pyopenssl).extract_ids()`, please switch to the new names `extract_patterns()`.\n  [#56](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/56)\n\n\n### added\n\n- `service_identity.(cryptography|pyopenssl).extract_patterns()` are now public apis (fka `extract_ids()`).\n  you can use them to extract the patterns from a certificate without verifying anything.\n  [#55](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/55)\n- *service-identity* is now fully typed.\n  [#57](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/57)\n\n\n----\n\n[\u2192 complete changelog](https://service-identity.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html)\n",
