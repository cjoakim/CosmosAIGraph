  "description": ".. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-session-security.svg\n        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-session-security\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/yourlabs/django-session-security/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg\n        :target: https://github.com/yourlabs/django-session-security/actions\n\n\n\nthis app provides a mechanism to logout inactive authenticated users. an\ninactive browser should be logged out automatically if the user left his\nworkstation, to protect sensitive data that may be displayed in the browser. it\nmay be useful for crms, intranets, and such projects.\n\nfor example, if the user leaves for a coffee break, this app can force logout\nafter say 5 minutes of inactivity.\n\nwhy not just set the session to expire after x minutes ?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nor \"why does this app even exist\" ? here are the reasons:\n\n- if the user session expires before the user is done reading a page: he will\n  have to login again.\n- if the user session expires before the user is done filling a form: his work\n  will be lost, and he will have to login again, and probably yell at you, dear\n  django dev ... at least i know i would !\n\nthis app allows to short circuit those limitations in session expiry.\n\nhow does it work ?\n------------------\n\nwhen the user loads a page, sessionsecurity middleware will set the last\nactivity to now. the last activity is stored as datetime\nin ``request.session['_session_security']``. to avoid having the middleware\nupdate that last activity datetime for a url, add the url to\n``settings.session_security_passive_urls``.\n\nwhen the user moves mouse, click, scroll or press a key, sessionsecurity will\nsave the datetime as a javascript attribute. it will send the number of seconds\nsince when the last user activity was recorded to pingview, next time it should\nping.\n\nfirst, a warning should be shown after ``settings.session_security_warn_after``\nseconds. the warning displays a text like \"your session is about to expire,\nmove the mouse to extend it\".\n\nbefore displaying this warning, sessionsecurity will upload the time since the\nlast client-side activity was recorded. the middleware will take it if it is\nshorter than what it already has - ie. another more recent activity was\ndetected in another browser tab. the pingview will respond with the number of\nseconds since the last activity - all browser tab included.\n\nif there was no other, more recent, activity recorded by the server: it will\nshow the warning. otherwise it will update the last activity in javascript from\nthe pingview response.\n\nsame goes to expire after ``settings.session_security_expire_after`` seconds.\njavascript will first make an ajax request to pingview to ensure that another\nmore recent activity was not detected anywhere else - in any other browser tab.\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\n- python 2.7 or 3.5+\n- jquery 1.7+\n- django 1.8 to 2.0\n- django.contrib.staticfiles or #yoyo\n\nresources\n---------\n\nyou could subscribe to the mailing list ask questions or just be informed of\npackage updates.\n\n- `git graciously hosted\n  <https://github.com/yourlabs/django-session-security/>`_ by `github\n  <http://github.com>`_,\n- `documentation graciously hosted\n  <http://django-session-security.rtfd.org>`_ by `rtfd\n  <http://rtfd.org>`_,\n- `package graciously hosted\n  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-session-security/>`_ by `pypi\n  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_,\n- `mailing list graciously hosted\n  <http://groups.google.com/group/yourlabs>`_ by `google\n  <http://groups.google.com>`_\n- for **security** issues, please contact yourlabs-security@googlegroups.com\n- `continuous integration graciously hosted\n  <http://travis-ci.org/yourlabs/django-session-security>`_ by `travis-ci\n  <http://travis-ci.org>`_\n\n\n",
