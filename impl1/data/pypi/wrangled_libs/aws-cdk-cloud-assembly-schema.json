  "description": "# cloud assembly schema\n\nthis module is part of the [aws cloud development kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.\n\n## cloud assembly\n\nthe *cloud assembly* is the output of the synthesis operation. it is produced as part of the\n[`cdk synth`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/main/packages/aws-cdk#cdk-synthesize)\ncommand, or the [`app.synth()`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/main/packages/@aws-cdk/core/lib/app.ts#l135) method invocation.\n\nits essentially a set of files and directories, one of which is the `manifest.json` file. it defines the set of instructions that are\nneeded in order to deploy the assembly directory.\n\n> for example, when `cdk deploy` is executed, the cli reads this file and performs its instructions:\n>\n> * build container images.\n> * upload assets.\n> * deploy cloudformation templates.\n\ntherefore, the assembly is how the cdk class library and cdk cli (or any other consumer) communicate. to ensure compatibility\nbetween the assembly and its consumers, we treat the manifest file as a well defined, versioned schema.\n\n## schema\n\nthis module contains the typescript structs that comprise the `manifest.json` file, as well as the\ngenerated [*json-schema*](./schema/cloud-assembly.schema.json).\n\n## versioning\n\nthe schema version is specified in the [`cloud-assembly.version.json`](./schema/cloud-assembly.schema.json) file, under the `version` property.\nit follows semantic versioning, but with a small twist.\n\nwhen we add instructions to the assembly, they are reflected in the manifest file and the *json-schema* accordingly.\nevery such instruction, is crucial for ensuring the correct deployment behavior. this means that to properly deploy a cloud assembly,\nconsumers must be aware of every such instruction modification.\n\nfor this reason, every change to the schema, even though it might not strictly break validation of the *json-schema* format,\nis considered `major` version bump.\n\n## how to consume\n\nif you'd like to consume the [schema file](./schema/cloud-assembly.schema.json) in order to do validations on `manifest.json` files,\nsimply download it from this repo and run it against standard *json-schema* validators, such as [jsonschema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonschema).\n\nconsumers must take into account the `major` version of the schema they are consuming. they should reject cloud assemblies\nwith a `major` version that is higher than what they expect. while schema validation might pass on such assemblies, the deployment integrity\ncannot be guaranteed because some instructions will be ignored.\n\n> for example, if your consumer was built when the schema version was 2.0.0, you should reject deploying cloud assemblies with a\n> manifest version of 3.0.0.\n\n## contributing\n\nsee [contribution guide](./contributing.md)\n",
