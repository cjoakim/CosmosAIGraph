  "description": "agent\n=======\n\nspotinst agent executor provides a mechanism to run remote shutdown scripts on machine using polling architecture.\n\nnote:\nthe agent must have token to communicate with spotinst api.\nthe credentials ini that holds the token file must be located at: '/root/.spotinst/credentials'\n\napplication\n===========\n\nmanual executing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nthe simplest way to run the agent is by './agent' that start and write basic logs to /var/log/messages/agent.log\n\notherwise, you can use the following options:\n\nusage:  ./agent [options]\n\n-c --config            use alternate configuration yml file.\n-l --log               use alternate log file for output.\n-t --test              test run.  do not run remote script.\n-v --verbose           verbose log\n--stdout               redirect output to stdout\n--debug                run with dummy credentials for debug purposes\n\nconfiguration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nthere are two levels of configuration representing in yml files.\nthe global configuration 'agent.yml' is responsible of the agent framework and necessary params.\nthe worker configuration, located at the workers folder is responsible of the specific workers parameters.\n\n\nmakefile\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nrun 'make release'\noutput file is located in the /dist folder\n\ndocumentation\n=============",
