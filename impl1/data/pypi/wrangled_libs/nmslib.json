  "description": "non-metric space library (nmslib) is an efficient cross-platform\r\nsimilarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of similarity search methods. \r\nthe goal of the project is to create an effective and comprehensive toolkit for searching \r\nin generic and non-metric spaces. even though the library contains a variety of metric-space \r\naccess methods, our main focus is on generic and approximate search methods, in particular, \r\non methods for non-metric spaces. nmslib is possibly the first library with a principled \r\nsupport for non-metric space searching.\r\n\r\n",
