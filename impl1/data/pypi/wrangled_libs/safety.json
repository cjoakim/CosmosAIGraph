  "description": "[![safety](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyupio/safety/master/safety.jpg)](https://pyup.io/safety/)\n\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/safety.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/safety)\n[![travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/pyupio/safety.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pyupio/safety)\n[![updates](https://pyup.io/repos/github/pyupio/safety/shield.svg)](https://pyup.io/repos/github/pyupio/safety/)\n\nsafety checks python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities and suggests the proper remediations for vulnerabilities detected. safety can be run on developer machines, in ci/cd pipelines and on production systems.\n\nby default it uses the open python vulnerability database [safety db](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db), which is **licensed for non-commercial use only**.\n\nfor all commercial projects, safely must be upgraded to use a [pyup api](https://pyup.io) using the `--key` option.\n\n# supported and tested python versions\n\npython: `3.6`, `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`\n\nsafety supports the above versions but only is tested in the latest patch version available at [python for actions\n](https://github.com/actions/python-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json). for instance, in python `3.6` we only will test with `3.6.15`, which is the latest python 3.6 version available on github actions.\n\nmake sure to use the latest patch available for your python version.\n\n# using safety as a github action\n\nsafety can be integrated into your existing github ci pipeline as an action. just add the following as a step in your workflow yaml file after setting your `safety_api_key` secret on github under settings -> secrets -> actions:\n\n```yaml\n      - uses: pyupio/safety@2.3.5\n        with:\n          api-key: ${{ secrets.safety_api_key }}\n```\n\n(don't have an api key? you can sign up for one with [pyup](https://pyup.io).)\n\nthis will run safety in auto-detect mode which figures out your project's structure and the best configuration to run in automatically. it'll fail your ci pipeline if any vulnerable packages are found.\n\nif you have something more complicated such as a monorepo; or once you're finished testing, read the [action documentation](https://docs.pyup.io/docs/github-actions-safety) for more details on configuring safety as an action.\n\n# installation\n\ninstall `safety` with pip. keep in mind that we support only python 3.6 and up.\n\n```bash\npip install safety\n```\n\n# documentation\n\nfor detailed documentation, please see [safety's documentation portal](https://docs.pyup.io/docs/getting-started-with-safety-cli).\n\n# basic usage\n\nto check your currently selected virtual environment for dependencies with known security\n vulnerabilities, run:\n\n```bash\nsafety check\n```\n\nyou should get a report similar to this:\n```bash\n+=================================================================================+\n\n                               /$$$$$$            /$$\n                              /$$__  $$

can really install that.*\n\nrun `safety check` again:\n\n```bash\n +=================================================================================+\n\n  safety v2.0.0.dev6 is scanning for vulnerabilities...\n  scanning dependencies in your environment:\n\n    -> /scanned-path/\n\n  using non-commercial database\n  found and scanned 295 packages\n  timestamp 2022-06-28 15:42:04\n  1

https://pyup.io/vulnerabilities/pve-2021-25853/25853/\n\n\n scan was completed.\n\n+=================================================================================+\n```\n\n\n## starter documentation\n\n### configuring the target of the scan\nsafety can scan requirements.txt files, the local environment as well as direct input piped into safety.\n\nto scan a requirements file:\n\n```bash\nsafety check -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nto scan the local environment:\n\n```bash\nsafety check\n```\n\nsafety is also able to read from stdin with the `--stdin` flag set.\n```\ncat requirements.txt | safety check --stdin\n```\n\nor the output of `pip freeze`:\n```\npip freeze | safety check --stdin\n```\n\nor to check a single package:\n```\necho \"insecure-package==0.1\" | safety check --stdin\n```\n\n*for more examples, take a look at the [options](#options) section.*\n\n\n### specifying the output format of the scan\n\nsafety can output the scan results in a variety of formats and outputs. this includes: screen, text, json, and bare outputs. using the ```--output``` flag to configure this output. the default output is to the screen.\n\n```--output json``` will output json for further processing and analysis.\n```--output text``` can be used to save the scan to file to later auditing.\n```--output bare``` simply prints out the packages that have known vulnerabilities\n\n### exit codes\n\nsafety by default emits exit codes based on the result of the code, allowing you to run safety inside of ci/cd processes. if no vulnerabilities were found the exit code will be 0. in cases of a vulnerability being found, non-zero exit codes will be returned.\n\n### scan a python-based docker image\n\nto scan a docker image `image_tag`, you can run\n\n```console\ndocker run -it --rm ${image_tag} /bin/bash -c \"pip install safety && safety check\"\n```\n\n## using safety in docker\n\nsafety can be easily executed as docker container. it can be used just as\ndescribed in the [examples](#examples) section.\n\n```console\necho \"insecure-package==0.1\" | docker run -i --rm pyupio/safety safety check --stdin\ncat requirements.txt | docker run -i --rm pyupio/safety safety check --stdin\n```\n\n## using the safety binaries\n\nthe safety [binaries](https://github.com/pyupio/safety/releases) provide some\n[extra security](https://pyup.io/posts/patched-vulnerability/).\n\nafter installation, they can be used just like the regular command line version\nof safety.\n\n## using safety with a ci service\n\nsafety works great in your ci pipeline. it returns by default meaningful non-zero exit codes:\n\n\n| code name      | meaning     | value  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| exit_code_ok                    | successful scan  | 0 |\n| exit_code_failure               | an unexpected issue happened, please run the debug mode and write to us      |   1 |\n| exit_code_vulnerabilities_found | safety found vulnerabilities      |    64 |\n| exit_code_invalid_api_key       | the api key used is invalid | 65 |\n| exit_code_too_many_requests     | you are making too many request, please wait around 40 seconds | 66 |\n| exit_code_unable_to_load_local_vulnerability_db | the local vulnerability database is malformed | 67 |\n| exit_code_unable_to_fetch_vulnerability_db | client network or server issues trying to fetch the database | 68 |\n| exit_code_malformed_db | the fetched vulnerability database is malformed or in the review command case, the report to review is malformed | 69 |\n\nif you want safety continues on error (always return zero exit code), you can use `--continue-on-error` flag\n\nrun it before or after your tests. if safety finds something, your tests will fail.\n\n**travis ci**\n```yaml\ninstall:\n  - pip install safety\n\nscript:\n  - safety check\n```\n\n**gitlab ci**\n```yaml\nsafety:\n  script:\n    - pip install safety\n    - safety check\n```\n\n**tox**\n```ini\n[tox]\nenvlist = py37\n\n[testenv]\ndeps =\n    safety\n    pytest\ncommands =\n    safety check\n    pytest\n```\n\n**deep github integration**\n\nif you are looking for a deep integration with your github repositories: safety is available as a\npart of [pyup.io](https://pyup.io/), called [safety ci](https://pyup.io/safety/ci/). safety ci\nchecks your commits and pull requests for dependencies with known security vulnerabilities\nand displays a status on github.\n\n![safety ci](https://github.com/pyupio/safety/raw/master/safety_ci.png)\n\n# using safety in production\n\nsafety is free and open source (mit licensed). the data it relies on from the free safety-db database is license for non-commercial use only, is limited and only updated once per month.\n\n**all commercial projects and teams must sign up for a paid plan at [pyup.io](https://pyup.io)**\n\n## options\n\n### `--key`\n\n*api key for pyup.io's vulnerability database. this can also be set as `safety_api_key` environment variable.*\n\n**example**\n```bash\nsafety check --key=12345-abcdefgh\n```\n\n___\n\n### `--db`\n\n*path to a directory with a local vulnerability database including `insecure.json` and `insecure_full.json`*\n\n**example**\n```bash\nsafety check --db=/home/safety-db/data\n```\n\n### `--proxy-host`\n\n*proxy host ip or dns*\n\n### `--proxy-port`\n\n*proxy port number*\n\n### `--proxy-protocol`\n\n*proxy protocol (https or http)*\n\n___\n\n\n### `--output json`\n\n*output a complete report with the vulnerabilities in json format.*\nthe report may be used too with the review command.\n\nif you are using the pyup commercial database, safety will use the same json structure but with all the full data for commercial users.\n\n**example**\n```bash\nsafety check --output json\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"report_meta\": {\n        \"scan_target\": \"environment\",\n        \"scanned\": [\n

patch versions starting with version 3.6. we\ndid support python 2.7 in the past but, as for other python 3.x minor versions,\nit reached its end-of-life and as such we are not able to support it anymore.\n\nwe understand you might still have python < 3.6 projects running. at the same\ntime, safety itself has a commitment to encourage developers to keep their\nsoftware up-to-date, and it would not make sense for us to work with officially\nunsupported python versions, or even those that reached their end of life.\n\nif you still need to run safety from a python 2.7 environment, please use\nversion 1.8.7 available at pypi. alternatively, you can run safety from a\npython 3 environment to check the requirements file for your python 2.7\nproject.\n\n# changelog\n\nall notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nthe format is partly based on [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand this project adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and [pep 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/)\n\n## [2.3.5] - 2022-12-08\n- pinned packaging dependency to a compatible range.\n- pinned the ci actions to the runner image with python 3.6 support.\n\n## [2.3.4] - 2022-12-07\n- removed legacyversion use; this fixes the issue with packaging 22.0.\n- fixed typos in the readme.\n- added python 3.11 to the classifiers in the setup.cfg.\n\n## [2.3.3] - 2022-11-27\n- fixed recursive requirements issue when an unpinned package is found.\n\n## [2.3.2] - 2022-11-21\n- fixed #423: bare output includes extra line in non-screen output with no vulnerabilities.\n- fixed #422: resourcewarning (unclosed socket) in safety v.2.3.1.\n- fixed telemetry data missing when the cli mode is used.\n- fixed wrong database fetching when the key and the database arguments are used at the same time.\n- added `safety_pure_yaml` env var, used for cases that require pure python in the yaml parser.\n\n## [2.3.1] - 2022-10-05\n- add `safety.alerts` module to setup.cfg\n\n## [2.3.0] - 2022-10-05\n- safety can now create github prs and issues for vulnerabilities directly, with the new `safety alert` subcommand.\n- support for github pr and issue alerting has been added to the github action.\n\n## [2.2.1] - 2022-10-04\n- fixed the use of the safety_color environment variable\n- fixed bug in the case of vulnerabilities without a cve linked\n- fixed github version in the readme\n\n## [2.2.0] - 2022-09-19\n- safety starts to use dparse to parse files, now safety supports mainly poetry and pipenv lock files plus other files supported by dparse.\n- added logic for custom integrations like pipenv check.\n- the --db flag is compatible remote sources too.\n- added more logging\n- upgrade dparse dependency to avoid a possible redos security issue\n- removed travis and appveyor, the ci/cd was migrated to github actions\n\n## [2.1.1] - 2022-07-18\n- fix crash when running on systems without git present (thanks @andyjones)\n\n## [2.1.0] - 2022-07-14\n\n### summary:\n- improved error messages & fixed issues with proxies\n- fixed license command\n- added the ability for scan outputs to be sent to pyup.io. this will only take effect if using an api key, the feature is enabled on your profile, and the `--disable-audit-and-monitor` is not set\n- added the ability to have a safety policy file set centrally on your pyup.io profile. this remote policy file will be used if there's no local policy file present, otherwise a warning will be issued.\n\n### updated outputs:\n- text & screen output: if a scan has been logged, this is now mentioned in the output.\n- json output: the json output now includes git metadata about the folder safety was run in. it also includes a version field, and telemetry information that would be sent separately. there are no breaking changes in the output.\n\n### new inputs:\n- new command line flags\n    - the `--disable-audit-and-monitor` flag can be set to disable sending a scan's result to pyup.io\n    - the `--project` flag can be set to manually specify a project to associate these scans with. by default, it'll autodetect based on the current folder and git.\n\n## [2.0.0] - 2022-06-28\n\n### summary:\n- compared to previous versions, safety 2.0 will be a significant update that includes new features and refactors, resulting in breaking changes to some inputs and outputs.\n\n### updated outputs:\n- text & screen output: upgraded the text and screen outputs, removing the old table style and adding new data and formats to vulnerabilities.\n- json output: new and updated json output (breaking change). safety adds all the possible information in the json report. the structure of this json file has been improved.\n- improved the support for exit codes. there are now custom exit codes with detailed information about the result. examples include: vulnerabilities_found and invalid_api_key.\n- added remediations (fix recommendations) sections to outputs. now, safety will suggest the steps to fix a detected vulnerability when an api key is used.\n- added new summary meta-data data to the reports showing the safety version used, the dependencies found, the timestamp, the target scanned, and more. these data are included in the text, screen, and json output for improved audit capabilities.\n- added more info per vulnerability, including urls to read more about a vulnerability and/or a package.\n\n###new command line flags:\n- new command line flags\n    - the `--output` flag replaces `--bare`, `--text`, `--screen`, and `--json` flags. in this new release, examples would be: `--output json` or `--output bare`.\n    - the `--continue-on-error` flag suppresses non-zero exit codes to force pass ci/cd checks, if required.\n    - the `--debug` flag allows for a more detailed output.\n    - the `--disable-telemetry` flag has been added to disable telemetry data\n    - the `--policy-file` flag to include a local security policy file. this file (called `.safety-policy.yml`, found in either the root directory where safety is being run or in a custom location) is based on yaml 1.2 and allows for:\n        - ignoring individual vulnerabilities with optionally a note and an expiry date.\n        - filtering vulnerabilities by their cvss severity. (cvss data is only available for some paid accounts.)\n\n### other\n- dropped support for python < 3.6\n- the free version of the safety vulnerability database is downloaded from a public s3 bucket (via pyup.io) and no longer from github. this free database is only updated once a month and is not licensed for commercial use.\n- telemetry data will be sent with every safety call. these data are anonymous and not sensitive. this includes the python version, the safety command used (`check`/`license`/`review`), and the safety options used (without their values). users can disable this functionality by adding the `--disable-telemetry` flag.\n- added validations to avoid the use of exclusive options.\n- added announcements feature to receive informative or critical messages from the pyup safety team.\n- increased test coverage.\n- now safety can be used as a dependency in your code\n- added safety as a github action\n- improved the help text in the cli\n- added the --save-json flag\n\n\n## [2.0b5] - 2022-06-24\n\n### summary:\n- removed the click context use, so safety can be used in non-cli cases\n- added safety as a github action\n- improved the cli help copy\n- increased the coverage\n\n## [2.0b4] - 2022-06-16\n\n### summary:\n- fixed issue with paddings and margins at specific console outputs like github actions console\n- added the --save-json flag and other aliases\n- added a fallback size for the terminal size function, related to https://bugs.python.org/issue42174\n- suppressed the announcements sent to stderr when it is running via 'run' environments\n\n\n## [2.0b3] - 2022-05-30\n\n### summary:\n- fixed issue in the screen and text report due to the remediations rendering for the users using an api key\n- improved the handling exception in the generate command\n\n\n## [2.0b2] - 2022-05-27\n\n### summary:\n- this version of safety is not stable; it is only a beta, pre-release version.\n- compared to previous versions, safety 2.0 will be a significant update that includes new features and refactors, resulting in breaking changes to some inputs and outputs.\n- improved grammar and formatting in the whole code\n- improved the exception handling in the .yml policy file parsing\n- improved the json output following the customers/users feedback - (this is a breaking change between beta releases)\n- added the generate command\n- added the validate command\n\n## [2.0b1] - 2022-05-08\n\n### summary:\n- this version of safety is not stable; it is only a beta, pre-release version.\n- compared to previous versions, safety 2.0 will be a significant update that includes new features and refactors, resulting in breaking changes to some inputs and outputs.\n\n### updated outputs:\n- text & screen output: upgraded the text and screen outputs, removing the old table style and adding new data and formats to vulnerabilities.\n- json output: new and updated json output (breaking change). safety adds all the possible information in the json report. the structure of this json file has been improved.\n- improved the support for exit codes. there are now custom exit codes with detailed information about the result. examples include: vulnerabilities_found and invalid_api_key.\n- added remediations (fix recommendations) sections to outputs. now, safety will suggest the steps to fix a detected vulnerability when an api key is used.\n- added new summary meta-data data to the reports showing the safety version used, the dependencies found, the timestamp, the target scanned, and more. these data are included in the text, screen, and json output for improved audit capabilities.\n- added more info per vulnerability, including urls to read more about a vulnerability and/or a package.\n\n### new inputs:\n- new command line flags\n    - the `--output` flag replaces `--bare`, `--text`, `--screen`, and `--json` flags. in this new release, examples would be: `--output json` or `--output bare`.\n    - the `--continue-on-error` flag suppresses non-zero exit codes to force pass ci/cd checks, if required.\n    - the `--debug` flag allows for a more detailed output.\n    - the `--disable-telemetry` flag has been added to disable telemetry data\n    - the `--policy-file` flag to include a local security policy file. this file (called `.safety-policy.yml`, found in either the root directory where safety is being run or in a custom location) is based on yaml 1.2 and allows for:\n        - ignoring individual vulnerabilities with optionally a note and an expiry date.\n        - filtering vulnerabilities by their cvss severity.
