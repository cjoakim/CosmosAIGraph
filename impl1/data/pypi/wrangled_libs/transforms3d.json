  "description": "############\ntransforms3d\n############\n\ncode to convert between various geometric transformations.\n\n* composing rotations / zooms / shears / translations into affine matrix;\n* decomposing affine matrix into rotations / zooms / shears / translations;\n* conversions between different representations of rotations, including:\n\n  * 3x3 rotation matrices;\n  * euler angles;\n  * quaternions.\n\nwe have tried to document the algorithms carefully and write clear code in the\nhope that this code can be a teaching reference.  we document the math behind\nsome of the algorithms using `sympy <http://www.sympy.org>`_ in\n``transforms3d/derivations``.  we would be very pleased if y'all would like to\nadd your own algorithms and derivations - please get a copy of the code from\nhttps://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3d and get on down,\nalgorithmically.  feel free to use the github issue tracker and pull request\nsystem to ask for advice and support.\n\n*************\ndocumentation\n*************\n\ndocumentation for latest released version at\nhttp://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d\n\n****\ncode\n****\n\nsee https://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3d\n\nreleased under the bsd two-clause license - see the file ``license`` in the\nsource distribution.\n\nmuch of the code comes from `transformations.py\n<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/code/transformations.py.html>`_ by christoph\ngohlke, also released under the bsd license.\n\nwe use github actions to test the code automatically under pythons 3.7 through\n3.10.\n\nwe depend on numpy >= 1.15.  you may be able to make it work on an earlier\nnumpy if you really needed that.\n\nthe latest released version is at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transforms3d\n\n*******\nsupport\n*******\n\nplease put up issues on the `transforms3d issue tracker\n<https://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3d/issues>`_.\n\n\n",
