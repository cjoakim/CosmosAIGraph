  "description": "=======\nneotime\n=======\n\nthe ``neotime`` module defines classes for working with temporal data to nanosecond precision.\nthese classes comprise a similar set to that provided by the standard library ``datetime`` module.\ninspiration has also been drawn from `iso-8601 <https://xkcd.com/1179/>`_.\n\n\noverview\n========\n\nthe classes are listed below:\n\n* `duration <https://neotime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/duration.html>`_\n* `date <https://neotime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/date.html>`_\n* `time <https://neotime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/time.html>`_\n* `datetime <https://neotime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datetime.html>`_\n* todo\n\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nto install the latest stable version of neotime, simply use pip:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    $ pip install --pre neotime\n\n\nor to install the latest bleeding edge code directly from github, use:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    $ pip install git+https://github.com/technige/neotime.git#egg=neotime\n\nnote that code installed directly from github is likely to be unstable.\nyour mileage may vary.\n\n\nmore information\n================\n\nfor more information, read the `docs <https://neotime.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n",
