  "description": "# ml_dtypes\n\n[![unittests](https://github.com/jax-ml/ml_dtypes/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jax-ml/ml_dtypes/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n[![wheel build](https://github.com/jax-ml/ml_dtypes/actions/workflows/wheels.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jax-ml/ml_dtypes/actions/workflows/wheels.yml)\n[![pypi version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ml_dtypes.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ml_dtypes)\n\n`ml_dtypes` is a stand-alone implementation of several numpy dtype extensions used in machine learning libraries, including:\n\n- [`bfloat16`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bfloat16_floating-point_format):\n  an alternative to the standard [`float16`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/half-precision_floating-point_format) format\n- `float8_*`: several experimental 8-bit floating point representations\n  including:\n  * `float8_e4m3b11fnuz`\n  * `float8_e4m3fn`\n  * `float8_e4m3fnuz`\n  * `float8_e5m2`\n  * `float8_e5m2fnuz`\n- `int4` and `uint4`: low precision integer types.\n\nsee below for specifications of these number formats.\n\n## installation\n\nthe `ml_dtypes` package is tested with python versions 3.9-3.12, and can be installed\nwith the following command:\n```\npip install ml_dtypes\n```\nto test your installation, you can run the following:\n```\npip install absl-py pytest\npytest --pyargs ml_dtypes\n```\nto build from source, clone the repository and run:\n```\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\npip install .\n```\n\n## example usage\n\n```python\n>>> from ml_dtypes import bfloat16\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> np.zeros(4, dtype=bfloat16)\narray([0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=bfloat16)\n```\nimporting `ml_dtypes` also registers the data types with numpy, so that they may\nbe referred to by their string name:\n```python\n>>> np.dtype('bfloat16')\ndtype(bfloat16)\n>>> np.dtype('float8_e5m2')\ndtype(float8_e5m2)\n```\n\n## specifications of implemented floating point formats\n\n### `bfloat16`\n\na `bfloat16` number is a single-precision float truncated at 16 bits.\n\nexponent: 8, mantissa: 7, exponent bias: 127. ieee 754, with nan and inf.\n\n### `float8_e4m3b11fnuz`\n\nexponent: 4, mantissa: 3, bias: 11.\n\nextended range: no inf, nan represented by 0b1000'0000.\n\n### `float8_e4m3fn`\n\nexponent: 4, mantissa: 3, bias: 7.\n\nextended range: no inf, nan represented by 0bs111'1111.\n\nthe `fn` suffix is for consistency with the corresponding llvm/mlir type, signaling this type is not consistent with ieee-754.  the `f` indicates it is finite values only. the `n` indicates it includes nans, but only at the outer range.\n\n### `float8_e4m3fnuz`\n\n8-bit floating point with 3 bit mantissa.\n\nan 8-bit floating point type with 1 sign bit, 4 bits exponent and 3 bits mantissa. the suffix `fnuz` is consistent with llvm/mlir naming and is derived from the differences to ieee floating point conventions. `f` is for \"finite\" (no infinities), `n` for with special nan encoding, `uz` for unsigned zero.\n\nthis type has the following characteristics:\n * bit encoding: s1e4m3 - `0bseeeemmm`\n * exponent bias: 8\n * infinities: not supported\n * nans: supported with sign bit set to 1, exponent bits and mantissa bits set to all 0s - `0b10000000`\n * denormals when exponent is 0\n\n### `float8_e5m2`\n\nexponent: 5, mantissa: 2, bias: 15. ieee 754, with nan and inf.\n\n### `float8_e5m2fnuz`\n\n8-bit floating point with 2 bit mantissa.\n\nan 8-bit floating point type with 1 sign bit, 5 bits exponent and 2 bits mantissa. the suffix `fnuz` is consistent with llvm/mlir naming and is derived from the differences to ieee floating point conventions. `f` is for \"finite\" (no infinities), `n` for with special nan encoding, `uz` for unsigned zero.\n\nthis type has the following characteristics:\n * bit encoding: s1e5m2 - `0bseeeeemm`\n * exponent bias: 16\n * infinities: not supported\n * nans: supported with sign bit set to 1, exponent bits and mantissa bits set to all 0s - `0b10000000`\n * denormals when exponent is 0\n\n## `int4` and `uint4`\n\n4-bit integer types, where each element is represented unpacked (i.e., padded up\nto a byte in memory).\n\nnumpy does not support types smaller than a single byte. for example, the\ndistance between adjacent elements in an array (`.strides`) is expressed in\nbytes. relaxing this restriction would be a considerable engineering project.\nthe `int4` and `uint4` types therefore use an unpacked representation, where\neach element of the array is padded up to a byte in memory. the lower four bits\nof each byte contain the representation of the number, whereas the upper four\nbits are ignored.\n\n## quirks of low-precision arithmetic\n\nif you're exploring the use of low-precision dtypes in your code, you should be\ncareful to anticipate when the precision loss might lead to surprising results.\none example is the behavior of aggregations like `sum`; consider this `bfloat16`\nsummation in numpy (run with version 1.24.2):\n```python\n>>> from ml_dtypes import bfloat16\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=0)\n>>> vals = rng.uniform(size=10000).astype(bfloat16)\n>>> vals.sum()\n256\n```\nthe true sum should be close to 5000, but numpy returns exactly 256: this is\nbecause `bfloat16` does not have the precision to increment `256` by values less than\n`1`:\n```python\n>>> bfloat16(256) + bfloat16(1)\n256\n```\nafter 256, the next representable value in bfloat16 is 258:\n```python\n>>> np.nextafter(bfloat16(256), bfloat16(np.inf))\n258\n```\nfor better results you can specify that the accumulation should happen in a\nhigher-precision type like `float32`:\n```python\n>>> vals.sum(dtype='float32').astype(bfloat16)\n4992\n```\nin contrast to numpy, projects like [jax](http://jax.readthedocs.io/) which support\nlow-precision arithmetic more natively will often do these kinds of higher-precision\naccumulations automatically:\n```python\n>>> import jax.numpy as jnp\n>>> jnp.array(vals).sum()\narray(4992, dtype=bfloat16)\n```\n\n## license\n\n*this is not an officially supported google product.*\n\nthe `ml_dtypes` source code is licensed under the apache 2.0 license\n(see [license](license)). pre-compiled wheels are built with the\n[eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) project, which is released under the\nmpl 2.0 license (see [license.eigen](license.eigen)).\n",
