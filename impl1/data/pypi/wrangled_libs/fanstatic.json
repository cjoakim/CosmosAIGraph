  "description": "=========\nfanstatic\n=========\n\nfanstatic is a smart static resource publisher for python. for more\ninformation on what it's about and how to use it, see:\nhttps://fanstatic.org\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/zopefoundation/fanstatic/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/zopefoundation/fanstatic/actions/workflows/tests.yml\n\n=======\nchanges\n=======\n\n1.4 (2023-09-19)\n================\n\n- drop python 2 leftovers. (support was dropped in 1.2)\n\n- add a bare miminumal readthedocs config file as per:\n\n  https://blog.readthedocs.com/migrate-configuration-v2/\n\n- add support for python 3.7, 3.11.\n\n\n1.3 (2022-12-21)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.9 and 3.10.\n  conditional support for shutilwhich for older python versions.\n\n- fix trove classifiers.\n\n- move tests to github actions.\n\n- make documentation buildable with python 3.\n\n\n1.2 (2022-03-11)\n================\n\nfeatures\n--------\n\n- use the packaging version parsing to determine whether a fanstatic library\n  is installed from a dev package, and set the library version accordingly.\n\nbackwards incompatible changes\n------------------------------\n\n- drop support for python 2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7.\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\n- update documentation to reflect the current place of repositories at github.\n\n\n1.1 (2019-01-22)\n================\n\nbackwards incompatible changes\n------------------------------\n\n- drop support for python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.\n\nother changes\n-------------\n\n- add support for python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.\n\n\n1.0.0 (2018-01-16)\n==================\n- fixup tests for new versions of dependencies and changed contracts. this\n  also improves python 3 compatibility.\n\n1.0a7 (2015-11-07)\n==================\n\n- make sure the registry is prepared if only the publisher is used\n  within a process.\n\n- fix bug with rollups and slots.\n\n1.0a6 (2015-10-21)\n==================\n\n- allow dependencies of a resources or a group to be modified after\n  being defined, but yet before being used. this allows to add\n  optional dependencies then needed to generically defined\n  packages. this required a complete re-factoring of the dependency\n  mechanism.\n\n- fix slot so they can be used then a compiler is defined.\n\n- remove fanstatic.codegen. that was not applicable in enough cases.\n\n\n1.0a5 (2014-02-09)\n==================\n\n- fix issue #87 \"install-error-with-python3\":\n\n  fanstatic now depends on shutil.which when it's available\n  (python 3.3+) or uses shutilwhich library in other cases. this\n  is useful because which.py is no longer supported.\n\n  thanks to ivan bulanov.\n\n1.0a4 (2013-09-24)\n==================\n\n- also setup the injector for head requests. we don't want the app which we\n  are wrapping to choke on the notimplementederror raised by\n  dummyneededresources.\n\n- update entry points in order to use the fanstatic publisher used as an\n  application instead of a filter, for instance in a configuration\n  with paste.urlmap.\n\n  http://pythonpaste.org/modules/urlmap.html\n\n1.0a3 (2013-08-12)\n==================\n\n- refactor neededresources into a pluggable injector system. fanstatic users\n  now have the possibility to customize how resources are injected into the\n  html.\n\n  we try to keep these changes backwards compatible for users that use\n  the official api. people that use fanstatic internals are encouraged to\n  update their code.\n\n- introduce \"inclusion\" object; the responsibilities around bundling,\n  compilation, debug/minified mode and rollup are moved from the\n  neededresources class to the inclusion class.\n\n1.0a2 (2013-05-25)\n==================\n\n- move injection of the inclusions from the beginning of the <head> element to\n  the end. see also:\n\n  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/fanstatic/vt_wasfdtl4\n\n  this change may break your code, but it is probably a good idea to include\n  the resources at the end of the <head>.\n\n- bugfix in sdist_compile: compile resources in *all* packages contained in a\n  distribution.\n\n- fix tox/travis setup and update to buildout v2.\n\n1.0a (2013-04-18)\n=================\n\n- add support for compilers and minifiers.\n\n  by default fanstatic ships with the sass/less and coffeescript compilers\n  and mincss/minjs/google closure minifiers.\n\n0.16 (2012-12-10)\n=================\n\n- update bundle object to share an api for the resource one.\n\n- update injector to handle html pages that doesn't explicit set a\n  charset in their headers.\n\n0.15 (2012-11-08)\n=================\n\n- add \"default\" argument to slot to specify a resource which will be filled\n  in if there is no other resource specified in need(). thanks to nilo.\n\n- ensure published bundles carry the correct content-type header. previously,\n  all bundles were delivered with `text/html`. thanks to david beitey.\n\n\n0.14 (2012-10-30)\n=================\n\n- alex gr\u00f6nholm added python3 and pypy support.\n\n- using tox to test on python2.6/2.7/3.2/3.3/pypy.\n\n- mirroring the bitbucket repo to github in order to run tests on travis-ci:\n\n  https://travis-ci.org/#!/fanstatic/fanstatic\n\n0.14a (2012-10-07)\n==================\n\n- removed the dependency on paste, replaced with webob.static.\n\n- the publisher no longer sends out etags, which seems like a good\n  idea. the `yahoo best practices for speeding up web sites <http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html>`_\n  say:\n\n    if you're not taking advantage of the flexible validation model that\n    etags provide, it's better to just remove the etag altogether.\n\n- updated package setup to be compatible with running\n  ``python setup.py test``.\n\n- added tox setup for testing across python versions.\n\n0.13.3 (2012-09-12)\n===================\n\n- no longer use webob's wsgify decorator in both the injector and\n  delegator middlewares, as it has issues handling parent application\n  wsgi response (https://github.com/pylons/webob/issues/74).\n\n0.13.2 (2012-08-23)\n===================\n\n- fixed issue #78: \"fanstatic.checksum.md5 is not guaranteed\", thanks to\n  takanao endoh.\n\n0.13.1 (2012-08-16)\n===================\n\n- fixed bug where mode resources created by string 'shortcut' didn't\n  inherit the renderer, bundling, dependency parameters.\n\n0.13 (2012-08-15)\n=================\n\n- dummyneededresources did not takes the slots argument.\n\n- resource.need() did not process the slots argument, despite the argument\n  being documented.\n\n- added slots argument to group.need().\n\n\n0.12 (2012-08-05)\n=================\n\n- documentation fix in code samples, thanks to toby dacre.\n\n- fix issue #74, minified .js not served in bottom unless force_bottom,\n  thanks to toby dacre.\n\n- cherry picked pull request #1 \"support-wsgi-apps-not-mounted-at-/\",\n  thanks to \u00e9ric lemoine.\n\n- add print css renderer.\n\n0.11.4 (2012-01-14)\n===================\n\n- there was another bug with ordering resources when multiple libraries\n  were involved. this time the way library_nr was calculated was changed\n  so that it wouldn't happen anymore.\n\n  the intent of library_nr was to have it always be 1 higher than the\n  maximum library_nr of any libraries this library is based on.\n\n  in practice this wouldn't always happen, because each resource had\n  its own library_nr. in some circumstances the resources in libraries\n  depending on other libraries would consistently get a library_nr too\n  low, as each resource they were based on had a library_nr that was\n  too low as well, even though another resource could exist in that\n  library with a higher library_nr. this could cause the library_nr of\n  all resources in a library to be too low.\n\n  this is now fixed to moving library_nr to the place it should've\n  maintained on in the first place: the library itself. it is\n  calculated now once per library, just before the resources are\n  sorted for the first time during the application's run. since by the\n  time resources need to be sorted all resources are known, the library_nr\n  can be calculated correctly.\n\n0.11.3 (2011-11-11)\n===================\n\n- there was a bug with ordering resources when multiple libraries\n  are involved: https://bitbucket.org/fanstatic/fanstatic/issue/67/ordering-of-resources-when-multiple\n\n0.11.2 (2011-05-19)\n===================\n\n- update the docs for readthedocs.org.\n\n0.11.1 (2011-04-13)\n===================\n\n- consolidate the resources (find rollups) before applying the mode.\n\n0.11 (2011-04-11)\n=================\n\n- add bundling support: bundles are collections of resources that can\n  be served in one http request. bundle urls are constructed by the\n  fanstatic injector and served by the fanstatic publisher.\n\n- remove eager_superseder arguments from resource, as this was not used.\n\n- abstracted features of resource, group, bundle into base classes\n  renderable and dependable.\n\n- improved sorting of resources for inclusion on web page. this is to\n  prepare for bundling support. ordering is now more consistent, no\n  matter in which order resources are .needed(). as long as you marked\n  dependencies right this shouldn't break applications; if your\n  resources are included in the wrong order now, fix resource dependencies.\n\n- base_url is not required anymore (as in the past); improve base_url\n  management api so that integration packages like zope.fanstatic have\n  a more explicit way to manage this information.\n\n- resources check whether the file they refer to exists or not. if\n  the file doesn't exist you get an unknownresourceerror.\n\n- renamed unknownresourceextension exception to\n  unknownresourceextensionerror. the old exception name is still\n  available for backwards compatibility.\n\n- use mtime instead of md5 for determining speeds up version computation\n  during development. the hashing method is still available for people who\n  don't trust their filesystem using the ``versioning_use_md5`` parameter.\n\n0.10.1 (2011-02-06)\n===================\n\n- fixed issue #49.\n\n\n0.10 (2011-01-19)\n=================\n\n- renamed ``hashing`` to ``versioning``. use the version of the python package\n  as the version identifier for a library, unless the package is installed in\n  development mode. if a library has no version or is in development, use the\n  hash of the library's directory contents as version identifier.\n\n- consolidated the resource modes into ``debug`` and ``minified``.\n\n- the injector component only sets up the neededresources if the request method\n  is get or post.\n\n- the ``devmode`` parameter has been renamed to ``recompute_hashes`` in order\n  to more aptly reflect its behavior. when recompute_hashes is true, hashes are\n  recomputed for every request - this is the default behavior.\n\n\n0.9b (2011-01-06)\n=================\n\nfanstatic is a fundamental rewrite of `hurry.resource`_. as such, fanstatic\nbreaks compatibility with hurry.resource. here's a list of essential changes\nsince version 0.10 of hurry.resource:\n\n- fundamental api cleanups and changes.\n\n- fanstatic no longer depends on ztk packages, and provides several 'pure' wsgi\n  components. this allows for greater re-use in different wsgi-based frameworks.\n\n- `zope.fanstatic`_ (a rewrite of `hurry.zoperesource`_) provides the integration of\n  fanstatic with the ztk.\n\n- fanstatic adds a wsgi component for serving resources, offloading it from the\n  application framework.\n\n- fanstatic adds 'infinite' caching functionality by computing a unique url\n  for every version of a resource.\n\n- fanstatic uses `py.test`_ for test discovery and execution.\n\n- a lot of effort has been put into documenting fanstatic.\n\n.. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource\n.. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource\n.. _`zope.fanstatic`:
