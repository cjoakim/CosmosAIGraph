actions](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/workflows/release%20trimesh/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/actions) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mikedh/trimesh/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=4pvrqxyl2h)](https://codecov.io/gh/mikedh/trimesh)  [![docker image version (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/trimesh/trimesh?label=docker&sort=semver)](https://hub.docker.com/r/trimesh/trimesh/tags) [![pypi version](https://badge.fury.io/py/trimesh.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/trimesh)\n\n\ntrimesh is a pure python 3.7+ library for loading and using [triangular meshes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triangle_mesh) with an emphasis on watertight surfaces. the goal of the library is to provide a full featured and well tested trimesh object which allows for easy manipulation and analysis, in the style of the polygon object in the [shapely library](https://github.com/toblerity/shapely).\n\nthe api is mostly stable, but this should not be relied on and is not guaranteed: install a specific version if you plan on deploying something using trimesh.\n\npull requests are appreciated and responded to promptly! if you'd like to contribute, here is an [up to date list of potential enhancements](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/issues/1557) although things not on that list are also welcome. here's a quick [development and contributing guide.](https://trimsh.org/contributing.html)\n\n\n## basic installation\n\nkeeping `trimesh` easy to install is a core goal, thus the *only* hard dependency is [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). installing other packages adds functionality but is not required. for the easiest install with just numpy, `pip` can generally install `trimesh` cleanly on windows, linux, and osx:\n\n```bash\npip install trimesh\n```\n\nthe minimal install can load many supported formats (stl, ply, gltf/glb) into numpy arrays. more functionality is available when soft dependencies are installed. this includes things like convex hulls (`scipy`), graph operations (`networkx`), faster ray queries (`pyembree`), vector path handling (`shapely` and `rtree`), xml formats like 3dxml/xaml/3mf (`lxml`), preview windows (`pyglet`), faster cache checks (`xxhash`), etc. to install `trimesh` with the soft dependencies that generally install cleanly on linux, osx, and windows using `pip`:\n```bash\npip install trimesh[easy]\n```\n\nfurther information is available in the [advanced installation documentation](https://trimsh.org/install.html).\n\n## quick start\n\nhere is an example of loading a mesh from file and colorizing its faces. here is a nicely formatted\n[ipython notebook version](https://trimsh.org/examples/quick_start.html) of this example. also check out the [cross section example](https://trimsh.org/examples/section.html).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport trimesh\n\n# attach to logger so trimesh messages will be printed to console\ntrimesh.util.attach_to_log()\n\n# mesh objects can be created from existing faces and vertex data\nmesh = trimesh.trimesh(vertices=[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]],\n                       faces=[[0, 1, 2]])\n\n# by default, trimesh will do a light processing, which will\n# remove any nan values and merge vertices that share position\n# if you want to not do this on load, you can pass `process=false`\nmesh = trimesh.trimesh(vertices=[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]],\n                       faces=[[0, 1, 2]],\n                       process=false)\n\n# some formats represent multiple meshes with multiple instances\n# the loader tries to return the datatype which makes the most sense\n# which will for scene-like files will return a `trimesh.scene` object.\n# if you *always* want a straight `trimesh.trimesh` you can ask the\n# loader to \"force\" the result into a mesh through concatenation\nmesh = trimesh.load('models/cesiummilktruck.glb', force='mesh')\n\n# mesh objects can be loaded from a file name or from a buffer\n# you can pass any of the kwargs for the `trimesh` constructor\n# to `trimesh.load`, including `process=false` if you would like\n# to preserve the original loaded data without merging vertices\n# stl files will be a soup of disconnected triangles without\n# merging vertices however and will not register as watertight\nmesh = trimesh.load('../models/featuretype.stl')\n\n# is the current mesh watertight?\nmesh.is_watertight\n\n# what's the euler number for the mesh?\nmesh.euler_number\n\n# the convex hull is another trimesh object that is available as a property\n# lets compare the volume of our mesh with the volume of its convex hull\nprint(mesh.volume / mesh.convex_hull.volume)\n\n# since the mesh is watertight, it means there is a\n# volumetric center of mass which we can set as the origin for our mesh\nmesh.vertices -= mesh.center_mass\n\n# what's the moment of inertia for the mesh?\nmesh.moment_inertia\n\n# if there are multiple bodies in the mesh we can split the mesh by\n# connected components of face adjacency\n# since this example mesh is a single watertight body we get a list of one mesh\nmesh.split()\n\n# facets are groups of coplanar adjacent faces\n# set each facet to a random color\n# colors are 8 bit rgba by default (n, 4) np.uint8\nfor facet in mesh.facets:\n    mesh.visual.face_colors[facet] = trimesh.visual.random_color()\n\n# preview mesh in an opengl window if you installed pyglet and scipy with pip\nmesh.show()\n\n# transform method can be passed a (4, 4) matrix and will cleanly apply the transform\nmesh.apply_transform(trimesh.transformations.random_rotation_matrix())\n\n# axis aligned bounding box is available\nmesh.bounding_box.extents\n\n# a minimum volume oriented bounding box also available\n# primitives are subclasses of trimesh objects which automatically generate\n# faces and vertices from data stored in the 'primitive' attribute\nmesh.bounding_box_oriented.primitive.extents\nmesh.bounding_box_oriented.primitive.transform\n\n# show the mesh appended with its oriented bounding box\n# the bounding box is a trimesh.primitives.box object, which subclasses\n# trimesh and lazily evaluates to fill in vertices and faces when requested\n# (press w in viewer to see triangles)\n(mesh + mesh.bounding_box_oriented).show()\n\n# bounding spheres and bounding cylinders of meshes are also\n# available, and will be the minimum volume version of each\n# except in certain degenerate cases, where they will be no worse\n# than a least squares fit version of the primitive.\nprint(mesh.bounding_box_oriented.volume,\n      mesh.bounding_cylinder.volume,\n      mesh.bounding_sphere.volume)\n\n```\n\n## features\n\n* import meshes from binary/ascii stl, wavefront obj, ascii off, binary/ascii ply, gltf/glb 2.0, 3mf, xaml, 3dxml, etc.\n* import and export 2d or

tracking numpy arrays for changes, grouping rows, etc.\n\n\n## viewer\n\ntrimesh includes an optional `pyglet` based viewer for debugging and inspecting. in the mesh view window, opened with `mesh.show()`, the following commands can be used:\n\n* `mouse click + drag` rotates the view\n* `ctl + mouse click + drag` pans the view\n* `mouse wheel` zooms\n* `z` returns to the base view\n* `w` toggles wireframe mode\n* `c` toggles backface culling\n* `g` toggles an xy grid with z set to lowest point\n* `a` toggles an xyz-rgb axis marker between: off, at world frame, or at every frame and world, and at every frame\n* `f` toggles between fullscreen and windowed mode\n* `m` maximizes the window\n* `q` closes the window\n\nif called from inside a `jupyter` notebook, `mesh.show()` displays an in-line preview using `three.js` to display the mesh or scene. for more complete rendering (pbr, better lighting, shaders, better off-screen support, etc) [pyrender](https://github.com/mmatl/pyrender) is designed to interoperate with `trimesh` objects.\n\n## projects using trimesh\n\nyou can check out the [github

should i use?\n\nquick recommendation: `glb` or `ply`. every time you replace `obj` with `glb` an angel gets its wings.\n\nif you want things like by-index faces, instancing, colors, textures, etc, `glb` is a terrific choice. gltf/glb is an [extremely well specified](https://github.com/khronosgroup/gltf/tree/master/specification/2.0) modern format that is easy and fast to parse: it has a json header describing data in a binary blob. it has a simple hierarchical scene graph, a great looking modern physically based material system, support in [dozens-to-hundreds of libraries](https://github.com/khronosgroup/gltf/issues/1058), and a [john carmack endorsment](https://www.khronos.org/news/press/significant-gltf-momentum-for-efficient-transmission-of-3d-scenes-models). note that gltf is a large specification, and `trimesh` only supports a subset of features: loading basic geometry is supported, not supported are fancier things like animations, skeletons, etc.\n\nin the wild, `stl` is perhaps the most common format. `stl` files are extremely simple: it is basically just a list of triangles. they are robust and are a good choice for basic geometry. binary `ply` files are a good step up, as they support indexed faces and colors.\n\nwavefront `obj` is also pretty common: unfortunately obj doesn't have a widely accepted specification so every importer and exporter implements things slightly differently, making it tough to support. it also allows unfortunate things like arbitrary sized polygons, has a face representation which is easy to mess up, references other files for materials and textures, arbitrarily interleaves data, and is slow to parse. give `glb` or `ply` a try as an alternative!\n\n## how can i cite this library?\n\na question that comes up pretty frequently is [how to cite the library.](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/issues?utf8=1&q=cite) a quick bibtex recommendation:\n```\n@software{trimesh,\n\tauthor = {{dawson-haggerty et al.}},\n\ttitle = {trimesh},\n\turl = {https://trimsh.org/},\n\tversion = {3.2.0},\n\tdate = {2019-12-8},\n}\n```\n\n## containers\n\nif you want to deploy something in a container that uses trimesh automated `debian:slim-bullseye` based builds with trimesh and most dependencies are available on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/trimesh/trimesh) with image tags for `latest`, git short hash for the commit in `main` (i.e. `trimesh/trimesh:0c1298d`), and version (i.e. `trimesh/trimesh:3.5.27`):\n\n`docker pull trimesh/trimesh`\n\n[here's an example](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/tree/main/examples/docker/render) of how to render meshes using llvmpipe and xvfb inside a container.\n\n",
