  "description": "\n# automl sphinx theme\n\nthe goal of this repository is to set up a documentation as fast and as clean as possible. in your\nsource project you only need to install `automl_sphinx_theme` to get all the features you need.\nthose include automatic api generation, beautiful theme, numpy docstring interpretation, and\nexecuting/plotting examples.\n\n<b>no complicated `.conf` or sphinx knowledge are necessary!</b><br />\n:sparkling_heart: you're welcome. :sparkling_heart:\n\n\n## installation\n\n- include `name`, `version`, `author`, `copyright` in `{package_name}/__init__.py`.\n- copy the `docs` and `examples` directories to your root folder. you don't have to include all\nfiles but you should at least include `docs/conf.py` and `docs/makefile`.\n- in `docs/conf.py` change `src` to `{package_name}`. adapt the file if needed.\n- install this repo via pypi:\n```\npip install automl_sphinx_theme\n```\n- you can generate the docs via `make html` inside the docs directory. have a look inside the\n`makefile` to get more information and commands.\n\nwe recommend using the repository `automl_template` which incorporates `automl_sphinx_theme`\nautomatically.\n\n\n## github\n\nthe documentation can be pushed automatically to a branch, which is used to display a webpage.\nfollow the steps to enable it:\n- copy `.github/workflows/docs.yml` to you root folder.\n- create a new branch called `gh-pages`.\n- go to `settings > pages` and select `gh-pages` as source.\n\n\n## version switching\n\nautoml sphinx theme provides the user to link older versions of documentations (must be done manually!). specify ``versions`` in the options to enable it. we recommend setting up a github workflow which automatically pushes the latest tag to the gh-pages. from there, you could link the version directly.\n\n\n## customization\n\n- logo: add docs/images/logo.png.\n- favicon: add docs/images/favicon.ico.\n\n",
