profiles, hashtags, user stories,\n  feeds and saved media**,\n\n- downloads **comments, geotags and captions** of each post,\n\n- automatically **detects profile name changes** and renames the target\n  directory accordingly,\n\n- allows **fine-grained customization** of filters and where to store\n  downloaded media,\n\n- automatically **resumes previously-interrupted** download iterations.\n\n::\n\n    instaloader [--comments] [--geotags]\n                [--stories] [--highlights] [--tagged] [--igtv]\n                [--login your-username] [--fast-update]\n

instagram\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nto **download all pictures and videos of a profile**, as well as the\n**profile picture**, do\n\n::\n\n    instaloader profile [profile ...]\n\nwhere ``profile`` is the name of a profile you want to download. instead\nof only one profile, you may also specify a list of profiles.\n\nto later **update your local copy** of that profiles, you may run\n\n::\n\n    instaloader --fast-update profile [profile ...]\n\nif ``--fast-update`` is given, instaloader stops when arriving at the\nfirst already-downloaded picture.\n\nalternatively, you can use ``--latest-stamps`` to have instaloader store\nthe time each profile was last downloaded and only download newer media:\n\n::\n\n    instaloader --latest-stamps -- profile [profile ...]\n\nwith this option it's possible to move or delete downloaded media and still keep\nthe archive updated.\n\nwhen updating profiles, instaloader\nautomatically **detects profile name changes** and renames the target directory\naccordingly.\n\ninstaloader can also be used to **download private profiles**. to do so,\ninvoke it with\n\n::\n\n    instaloader --login=your_username profile [profile ...]\n\nwhen logging in, instaloader **stores the session cookies** in a file in your\ntemporary directory, which will be reused later the next time ``--login``\nis given.  so you can download private profiles **non-interactively** when you\nalready have a valid session cookie file.\n\n`instaloader documentation
