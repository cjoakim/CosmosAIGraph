  "description": "====================================\npython library for calculating crc16\n====================================\n\ncrc is a way of detecting accidental changes in data storage or\ntransmission.  there are many variants of crc and crc16, in particular.\nthis library calculates only crc16 (16-bit codes) and the only supported\nvariant at the moment is crc-ccitt (xmodem).\n\nif you want to know more about crc,\nhttp://wikipedia.org/wiki/cyclic_redundancy_check is a good place to start.\n\nif you want other variants of crc16 supported, please make a request at\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pycrc16/issues\n\nsource codes are hosted at https://github.com/gennady/pycrc16\nif you want to contribute to this library, create a fork, make you changes\nand then create a pull request.  any help is appreciated.\n\n------------\ninstallation\n------------\n\non windows you can use precompiled binaries which can be found at\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pycrc16/downloads\n\non linux and other operation systems you should compile the library from\nthe source codes.  to do this on linux use following steps:\n\n* download source tarball, e.g. crc16-0.1.1.tar.gz,\n  from http://code.google.com/p/pycrc16/downloads\n\n* extract it with command::\n\n    tar -xzf crc16-0.1.1.tar.gz\n\n* compile and install the library::\n\n    cd crc16-0.1.1\n    python setup.py build\n    sudo python setup.py install\n\n  you will need the administrative privileges to execute the last\n  command.\n\nafter installation you can run unit tests to make sure that the library\nworks fine.  execute::\n\n  python -m crc16.test\n\n-----\nusage\n-----\n\nin python 3::\n\n    import crc16\n    print(crc16.crc16xmodem(b'123456789'))\n\nin python 2 you should use strings instead of binary data::\n\n    import crc16\n    print(crc16.crc16xmodem('123456789'))\n\nyou can also calculate crc gradually::\n\n    import crc16\n    crc = crc16.crc16xmodem(b'1234')\n    crc = crc16.crc16xmodem(b'56789', crc)\n    print(crc)\n\n--------------\nother projects\n--------------\n\nthere are a number of projects and libraries for crc calculation.\nsee for example:\n\n* binascii.crc32 in the standart python library\n\n* pycrc (http://www.tty1.net/pycrc)\n\n* crcmod (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod)",
