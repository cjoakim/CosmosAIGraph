  "description": "pkcs#12 support for requests\n============================\n\nthis library adds pkcs#12 support to the python `requests <http://python-requests.org>`__ library.\n\nit is a **clean implementation**: it uses neither monkey patching nor unencrypted temporary files. instead, it is integrated into ``requests`` as\nrecommended by its authors: creating a custom ``transportadapter``, which provides a custom ``sslcontext``.\n\nthis library is meant to be a transitional solution until this functionality is provided by ``requests`` directly. however, that will take some time. see the `corresponding issue <https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/2519>`__ for more details.\n\nusage\n-----\n\nfor simple one-off requests you can use this library as a drop-in replacement for the ``requests`` library:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   from requests_pkcs12 import get\n\n   r = get('https://example.com/test', pkcs12_filename='clientcert.p12', pkcs12_password='correcthorsebatterystaple')\n\nif you are using `requests sessions <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/>`__, use the ``pkcs12adapter``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   from requests import session\n   from requests_pkcs12 import pkcs12adapter\n\n   with session() as s:\n       s.mount('https://example.com', pkcs12adapter(pkcs12_filename='clientcert.p12', pkcs12_password='correcthorsebatterystaple'))\n       r = s.get('https://example.com/test')\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nthis library is available as `pypi package <https://pypi.org/project/requests-pkcs12/>`__:\n\n::\n\n   pip install requests-pkcs12\n\nalternatively, you can retrieve the latest development version via git:\n\n::\n\n   git clone https://github.com/m-click/requests_pkcs12\n\narguments\n---------\n\nthe following keyword arguments are supported:\n\n-  ``pkcs12_filename`` is a byte string or unicode string that contains the file name of the encrypted pkcs#12 certificate.\n\n   -  either this argument or ``pkcs12_data`` must be provided.\n\n-  ``pkcs12_data`` is a byte string that contains the encrypted pkcs#12 certificate data.\n\n   -  either this argument or ``pkcs12_filename`` must be provided.\n\n-  ``pkcs12_password`` is a byte string or unicode string that contains the password.\n\n   -  this argument must be provided whenever ``pkcs12_filename`` or ``pkcs12_data`` is provided.\n\n-  ``ssl_protocol`` is a protocol version from the ``ssl`` library.\n\n   -  this argument is optional and defaults to ``ssl.protocol_tls``.\n\nif you use these parameters, don\u2019t use the built-in ``cert`` parameter of ``requests`` at the same time. however, do use the other parameters.  in particular, do use `the \"verify\" parameter <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification>`__ to verify the server-side certificate.\n",
