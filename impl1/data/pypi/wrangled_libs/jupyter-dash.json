  "description": "# jupyter dash\n[![binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/plotly/jupyter-dash/master?urlpath=tree/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb)\n\nthis library makes it easy to develop plotly dash apps interactively from within jupyter environments (e.g. classic notebook, jupyterlab, visual studio code notebooks, nteract, pycharm notebooks, etc.).\n\n![jupterlab example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15064365/82324108-150d4200-99a7-11ea-8d22-5c1bb8acaadb.gif)\n\nsee the [notebooks/getting_started.ipynb](https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash/blob/master/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb) for more information and example usage.\n\n# installation\nyou can install the jupyterdash python package using pip...\n```\n$ pip install jupyter-dash\n```\nor conda\n```\n$ conda install -c conda-forge -c plotly jupyter-dash\n```\n\n## jupyterlab support\nwhen used in jupyterlab, jupyterdash depends on the [`jupyterlab-dash`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyterlab-dash) jupyterlab extension, which requires jupyterlab version 2.0 or above.\n \nthis extension is included with the python package, but in order to activate it jupyterlab must be rebuilt. jupyterlab should automatically produce a popup dialog asking for permission to rebuild, but the rebuild can also be performed manually from the command line using:\n \n ```\n$ jupyter lab build\n```\n\nto check that the extension is installed properly, call `jupyter labextension list`.\n\n## colab support\nas of version 0.3.0, `jupyterdash` works in colab with no additional configuration. just install `jupyter-dash` using pip in a colab notebook cell\n```\n!pip install jupyter-dash\n```\n\n# features\nto learn more about the features of jupyterdash, check out the [announcement post](https://medium.com/plotly/introducing-jupyterdash-811f1f57c02e).\n\n# development\nto develop jupyterdash, first create and activate a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda.\n\nthen clone the repository and change directory to the repository root:\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash.git\n$ cd jupyter-dash\n```\n\nthen install the dependencies:\n```\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt \n```\n\nthen install the python package in editable mode. note: this will require [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed.\n```\n$ pip install -e .\n```\n\nthen install the classic notebook extension in development mode:\n```\n$ jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --py jupyter_dash\n$ jupyter nbextension enable --py jupyter_dash\n```\n\nthen install the jupyterlab extension in development mode:\n```\n$ jupyter labextension link extensions/jupyterlab\n```\n\nfor release, build the jupyterlab extension to bundle with the python package (see [release.md](https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash/blob/master/release.md) for the full process):\n\n```\n$ python setup.py build_js\n```\n\n\n",
