  "description": "cytoolz\n=======\n\n|build status| |version status|\n\ncython implementation of the\n|literal toolz|_ `package, <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toolz/>`__ which\nprovides high performance utility functions for iterables, functions,\nand dictionaries.\n\n.. |literal toolz| replace:: ``toolz``\n.. _literal toolz: https://github.com/pytoolz/toolz\n\n``toolz`` is a pure python package that borrows heavily from contemporary\nfunctional languanges.  it is designed to interoperate seamlessly with other\nlibraries including ``itertools``, ``functools``, and third party libraries.\nhigh performance functional data analysis is possible with builtin types\nlike ``list`` and ``dict``, and user-defined data structures; and low memory\nusage is achieved by using the iterator protocol and returning iterators\nwhenever possible.\n\n``cytoolz`` implements the same api as ``toolz``.  the main differences are\nthat ``cytoolz`` is faster (typically 2-5x faster with a few spectacular\nexceptions) and ``cytoolz`` offers a c api that is accessible to other\nprojects developed in cython.  since ``toolz`` is able to process very\nlarge (potentially infinite) data sets, the performance increase gained by\nusing ``cytoolz`` can be significant.\n\nsee the pytoolz documentation at https://toolz.readthedocs.io and the full\n`api documentation <https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`__\nfor more details.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nnew bsd. see `license file <https://github.com/pytoolz/cytoolz/blob/master/license.txt>`__.\n\n\ninstall\n-------\n\n``cytoolz`` is on the python package index (pypi):\n\n::\n\n    pip install cytoolz\n\ndependencies\n------------\n\n``cytoolz`` supports python 3.6+ with a common codebase.\nit is developed in cython, but requires no dependecies other than cpython\nand a c compiler.  like ``toolz``, it is a light weight dependency.\n\ncontributions welcome\n---------------------\n\n``toolz`` (and ``cytoolz``) aims to be a repository for utility functions,\nparticularly those that come from the functional programming and list\nprocessing traditions. we welcome contributions that fall within this scope\nand encourage users to scrape their ``util.py`` files for functions that are\nbroadly useful.\n\nplease take a look at our issue pages for\n`toolz <https://github.com/pytoolz/toolz/issues>`__ and\n`cytoolz <https://github.com/pytoolz/cytoolz/issues>`__\nfor contribution ideas.\n\ncommunity\n---------\n\nsee our `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pytoolz>`__.\nwe're friendly.\n\n.. |build status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/pytoolz/cytoolz.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/pytoolz/cytoolz\n.. |version status| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/cytoolz.svg\n   :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/cytoolz\n",
