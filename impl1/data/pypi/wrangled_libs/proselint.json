is notoriously hard, even for the best writers, and it's not for lack of good advice \u2014 a tremendous amount of knowledge about the craft is strewn across usage guides, dictionaries, technical manuals, essays, pamphlets, websites, and the hearts and minds of great authors and editors. but poring over strunk & white hardly makes one a better writer \u2014 it turns you into neither strunk nor white. and nobody has the capacity to apply all the advice from *garner\u2019s modern english usage*, an 1100-page usage guide, to everything they write. in fact, the whole notion that one becomes a better writer by reading advice on writing rests on untenable assumptions about learning and memory. the traditional formats of knowledge about writing are thus essentially inert, waiting to be transformed.\n\nwe devised a simple solution: `proselint`, a linter for english prose. a linter is a computer program that, akin to a spell checker, scans through a file and detects issues \u2014 like how a real lint roller helps you get unwanted lint off of your shirt.\n\n`proselint` places the world's greatest writers and editors by your side, where they whisper suggestions on how to improve your prose. you\u2019ll be guided by advice inspired by bryan garner, david foster wallace, chuck palahniuk, steve pinker, mary norris, mark twain, elmore leonard, george orwell, matthew butterick, william strunk, elwyn white, philip corbett, ernest gowers, and the editorial staff of the world\u2019s finest literary magazines and newspapers, among others. our goal is to aggregate knowledge about best practices in writing and to make that knowledge immediately accessible to all authors in the form of a linter for prose; all in a neat command-line utility that you can integrate into other tools, scripts, and workflows.\n\n### installation\n\nto get this up and running, install it using [pip]:\n\n```bash\npip install proselint\n```\n\n[pip]:

unique.\n```\n\nyou can run `proselint` over the document using the command line:\n\n```bash\nproselint text.md\n```\n\nthis prints a list of suggestions to stdout, one per line. each suggestion has the form:\n\n```bash\ntext.md:<line>:<column>: <check_name> <message>\n```\n\nfor example,\n\n```bash\ntext.md:0:10: wallace.uncomparables comparison of an uncomparable: 'unique' cannot be compared.\n```\n\nthe command-line utility can also print suggestions in json using the `--json` flag. in this case, the output is considerably richer:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  // type of check that output this suggestion.\n  check: \"wallace.uncomparables\",\n\n  // message to describe the suggestion.\n  message: \"comparison of an uncomparable: 'unique' cannot be compared.\",\n\n  // the person or organization giving the suggestion.\n  source: \"david foster wallace\"\n\n  // url pointing to the source material.\n  source_url: \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/9715551\"\n\n  // line where the error starts.\n  line: 0,\n\n  // column where the error starts.\n  column: 10,\n\n  // index in the text where the error starts.\n  start: 10,\n\n  // index in the text where the error ends.\n  end: 21,\n\n  // length from start -> end\n  extent: 11,\n\n  // how important is this? can be \"suggestion\", \"warning\", or \"error\".\n  severity: \"warning\",\n\n  // possible replacements.\n  replacements: [\n    {\n      value: \"unique\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nto run the linter as part of another python program, you can use the `lint` function in `proselint.tools`:\n\n```python\nimport proselint\n\nsuggestions = proselint.tools.lint(\"this sentence is very unique\")\n```\n\nthis will return a list of suggestions:\n\n```python\n[('weasel_words.very', \"substitute 'damn' every time you're inclined to write 'very;' your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.\", 0, 17, 17, 22, 5, 'warning', none), ('uncomparables.misc', \"comparison of an uncomparable: 'very unique.' is not comparable.\", 0, 17, 17, 29, 12, 'warning', none)]\n```\n\n### checks\n\nyou can disable any of the checks by modifying `$xdg_config_home/proselint/config`. if `$xdg_config_home` is not set or empty, `~/.config/proselint/config` will be used. additionally, for compatibility reasons, the legacy configuration `~/.proselintrc` will be checked if `$xdg_config_home/proselint/config` does not exist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"checks\": {\n    \"typography.diacritical_marks\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n| id    | description     |\n| ----- | ---------------
