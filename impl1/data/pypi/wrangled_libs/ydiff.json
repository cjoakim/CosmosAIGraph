streamline reading large patch set\n  - new ``--log (-l)`` option to read revision control diff log (thanks to\n    `steven myint`_)\n\nversion 0.4 (2013-02-16)\n\n  - new option *-c when* (*--color when*) to support auto test\n  - auto regression test now on travis\n\nversion 0.3 (2013-02-07)\n\n  - support compare two files (wrapper of diff)\n\nversion 0.2 (2013-02-06)\n\n  - move cdiff.py to top dir for better meta info management\n\nversion 0.1 (2013-02-05)\n\n  -
