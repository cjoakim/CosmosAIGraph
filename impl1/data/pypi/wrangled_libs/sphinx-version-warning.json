  "description": "================================\nsphinx version warning extension\n================================\n\n\nsphinx version warning is a sphinx_ extension that allows you to show a *warning* banner at the top of your documentation.\nthe banner is shown based on the version that is displayed compared (using semver_) with the latest version on the server.\n\nthis extension was originally created to be compatible with `read the docs`_ api and currently it's the only backend that supports\n(inspired by https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/3481#issuecomment-378000845)\n\n.. _sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/\n.. _semver: https://semver.org/\n.. _read the docs: http://readthedocs.org/\n\n\nhow it works?\n-------------\n\nwhen visiting a page in read the docs that was built with this extension enabled,\nan ajax request is done to the read the docs servers to retrieve all the **active versions** of the project.\nthese versions are compared against the one that we are reading and if it's an old version,\na *warning* banner appears at the top of the page.\n\n\nexamples\n--------\n\n.. image:: warning-example.png\n\nthere is a live example living at read the docs:\n\n- `latest`_ version doesn't show any kind of warning banner\n- `0.0.1`_ version shows a custom message for this particular version\n- `0.0.2`_ version shows a warning banner saying that 0.0.4 is available (at the time of writing this docs)\n- `0.0.4`_ version doesn't show any banner since it's the latest version (at the time of writing this docs)\n\n\n.. _latest: https://sphinx-version-warning-example.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _0.0.1: https://sphinx-version-warning-example.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.1/\n.. _0.0.2: https://sphinx-version-warning-example.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.2/\n.. _0.0.4: https://sphinx-version-warning-example.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.4/\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\njust run this ``pip`` command inside your virtualenv::\n\n   pip install sphinx-version-warning\n\n\nthen in your ``conf.py`` you have to add ``versionwarning.extension`` in the ``extensions`` list.\nshould be similar to::\n\n  extensions = [\n      'versionwarning.extension',\n  ]\n\n\nremember to configure the ``versionwarning_project_version`` and ``versionwarning_project_slug`` of your sphinx project since it's the key for this to work properly::\n\n  versionwarning_project_version = '0.0.1'\n  versionwarning_project_slug = 'sphinx-version-warning'\n\n.. warning::\n\n   if you are building your documentation under read the docs,\n   ``readthedocs_version`` and ``readthedocs_proect`` environment variables will be defined and there is no need to define these variables,\n   unless you want to override the default values.\n\n\ncustomization\n-------------\n\nsome customization can be done using the ``conf.py`` file of your sphinx project:\n\nversionwarning_admonition_type (string)\n   type of admonition for the banner (warning, admonition or note)\n\nversionwarning_default_message (string)\n   default message for the warning banner\n\nversionwarning_messages (dict)\n   mapping between versions and messages for its banners\n\nversionwarning_message_placeholder (string)\n   text to be replaced by the version number link from the message\n\nversionwarning_project_slug (string)\n   slug of the project under read the docs (default to ``readthedocs_project`` environment variable)\n\nversionwarning_project_version (string)\n   slug of the version for the current documentation (default to ``readthedocs_version`` environment variable)\n\nversionwarning_api_url (string)\n   api url to retrieve all versions for this project\n\nversionwarning_banner_html (string)\n   html code used for the banner shown\n\nversionwarning_banner_id_div (string)\n   html element id used for the <div> inject as banner\n\nversionwarning_body_selector (string)\n   jquery selector to find the body element in the page and *prepend* the banner\n\n\nhow to contribute?\n------------------\n\npull requests are always welcome!\n\ngenerate assets\n***************\n\n::\n\n    npm install\n    ./node_modules/.bin/webpack\n\n\nreleasing\n---------\n\n#. increment the version in ``versionwarning/__init__.py``\n#. increment the version in ``package.json``\n#. update the ``changelog.rst``\n#. update ``npm``::\n\n     $ npm update\n\n#. compile assets::\n\n     $ npm install\n     $ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack\n\n#. commit the changes: ``git commit -m \"release $new_version\"``\n#. tag the release in git: ``git tag $new_version``\n#. push the tag to github: ``git push --tags origin``\n#. upload the package to pypi::\n\n     $ rm -rf dist/\n     $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n     $ twine upload dist/*\n\n\n",
