  "description": "# jupyter notebook\n\n![github actions status](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/workflows/build/badge.svg)\n[![documentation status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jupyter-notebook/badge/?version=latest)](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n[![binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter/notebook/main?urlpath=tree)\n[![gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitpod_editor-open-blue.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)\n\nthe jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive\ncomputing.\n\n![jupyter notebook example](docs/resources/running_code_med.png 'jupyter notebook example')\n\n## maintained versions\n\nwe maintain the **two most recently released major versions of jupyter notebook**, notebook v5 and classic notebook v6. after notebook v7.0 is released, we will no longer maintain notebook v5. all notebook v5 users are strongly advised to upgrade to classic notebook v6 as soon as possible.\n\nthe jupyter notebook project is currently undertaking a transition to a more modern code base built from the ground-up using jupyterlab components and extensions.\n\nthere is new stream of work which was submitted and then accepted as a jupyter enhancement proposal (jep) as part of the next version (v7): https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html\n\nthere is also a plan to continue maintaining notebook v6 with bug and security fixes only, to ease the transition to notebook v7: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook-team-compass/issues/5#issuecomment-1085254000\n\n### notebook v7\n\nthe newest major version of notebook is based on:\n\n- jupyterlab components for the frontend\n- jupyter server for the python server\n\nthis represents a significant change to the `jupyter/notebook` code base.\n\nto learn more about notebook v7: https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html\n\n### classic notebook v6\n\nmaintenance and security-related issues are now being addressed in the [`6.4.x`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/tree/6.4.x) branch.\n\na `6.5.x` branch will be soon created and will depend on [`nbclassic`](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclassic) for the html/javascript/css assets.\n\nnew features and continuous improvement is now focused on notebook v7 (see section above).\n\nif you have an open pull request with a new feature or if you were planning to open one, we encourage switching over to the jupyter server and jupyterlab architecture, and distribute it as a server extension and / or jupyterlab prebuilt extension. that way your new feature will also be compatible with the new notebook v7.\n\n## jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of ipython notebook\n\njupyter notebook is a language-agnostic html notebook application for\nproject jupyter. in 2015, jupyter notebook was released as a part of\nthe big split\u2122 of the ipython codebase. ipython 3 was the last major monolithic\nrelease containing both language-agnostic code, such as the _ipython notebook_,\nand language specific code, such as the _ipython kernel for python_. as\ncomputing spans across many languages, project jupyter will continue to develop the\nlanguage-agnostic **jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the\ncommunity develop language specific kernels which are found in their own\ndiscrete repos.\n\n- [the big split\u2122 announcement](https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7)\n- [jupyter ascending blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-ascending-1bf5b362d97e)\n\n## installation\n\nyou can find the installation documentation for the\n[jupyter platform, on readthedocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\nthe documentation for advanced usage of jupyter notebook can be found\n[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nfor a local installation, make sure you have\n[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:\n\n```bash\npip install notebook\n```\n\n## usage - running jupyter notebook\n\n### running in a local installation\n\nlaunch with:\n\n```bash\njupyter notebook\n```\n\n### running in a remote installation\n\nyou need some configuration before starting jupyter notebook remotely. see [running a notebook server](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/public-server.html).\n\n## development installation\n\nsee [`contributing.md`](contributing.md) for how to set up a local development installation.\n\n## contributing\n\nif you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`contributing.md`](contributing.md).\n\n## community guidelines and code of conduct\n\nthis repository is a jupyter project and follows the jupyter\n[community guides and code of conduct](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).\n\n## resources\n\n- [project jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)\n- [online demo at jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)\n- [documentation for jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- [korean version of installation](https://github.com/chungjooho/jupyter_kor_doc/)\n- [documentation for project jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues)\n- [technical support - jupyter google group](https://discourse.jupyter.org/)\n\n## about the jupyter development team\n\nthe jupyter development team is the set of all contributors to the jupyter project.\nthis includes all of the jupyter subprojects.\n\nthe core team that coordinates development on github can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\n\n## our copyright policy\n\njupyter uses a shared copyright model. each contributor maintains copyright\nover their contributions to jupyter. but, it is important to note that these\ncontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. thus, the jupyter\nsource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or\ninstitution. instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire jupyter\ndevelopment team. if individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\nchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\ntheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\nchange to one of the jupyter repositories.\n\nwith this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\nto indicate the copyright and license terms:\n\n```\n# copyright (c) jupyter development team.\n# distributed under the terms of the modified bsd license.\n```\n",
