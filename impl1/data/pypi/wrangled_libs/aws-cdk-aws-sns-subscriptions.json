  "description": "# cdk construct library for amazon simple notification service subscriptions\n\n<!--begin stability banner-->---\n\n\n![end-of-support](https://img.shields.io/badge/end--of--support-critical.svg?style=for-the-badge)\n\n> aws cdk v1 has reached end-of-support on 2023-06-01.\n> this package is no longer being updated, and users should migrate to aws cdk v2.\n>\n> for more information on how to migrate, see the [*migrating to aws cdk v2* guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/migrating-v2.html).\n\n---\n<!--end stability banner-->\n\nthis library provides constructs for adding subscriptions to an amazon sns topic.\nsubscriptions can be added by calling the `.addsubscription(...)` method on the topic.\n\n## subscriptions\n\nsubscriptions can be added to the following endpoints:\n\n* https\n* amazon sqs\n* aws lambda\n* email\n* sms\n\nsubscriptions to amazon sqs and aws lambda can be added on topics across regions.\n\ncreate an amazon sns topic to add subscriptions.\n\n```python\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"mytopic\")\n```\n\n### https\n\nadd an http or https subscription to your topic:\n\n```python\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"mytopic\")\n\nmy_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.urlsubscription(\"https://foobar.com/\"))\n```\n\nthe url being subscribed can also be [tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tokens.html), that resolve\nto a url during deployment. a typical use case is when the url is passed in as a [cloudformation\nparameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudformation/latest/userguide/parameters-section-structure.html). the\nfollowing code defines a cloudformation parameter and uses it in a url subscription.\n\n```python\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"mytopic\")\nurl = cfnparameter(self, \"url-param\")\n\nmy_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.urlsubscription(url.value_as_string))\n```\n\n### amazon sqs\n\nsubscribe a queue to your topic:\n\n```python\nmy_queue = sqs.queue(self, \"myqueue\")\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"mytopic\")\n\nmy_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.sqssubscription(my_queue))\n```\n\nkms key permissions will automatically be granted to sns when a subscription is made to\nan encrypted queue.\n\nnote that subscriptions of queues in different accounts need to be manually confirmed by\nreading the initial message from the queue and visiting the link found in it.\n\n### aws lambda\n\nsubscribe an aws lambda function to your topic:\n\n```python\nimport aws_cdk.aws_lambda as lambda_\n# my_function: lambda.function\n\n\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"mytopic\")\nmy_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.lambdasubscription(my_function))\n```\n\n### email\n\nsubscribe an email address to your topic:\n\n```python\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"mytopic\")\nmy_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.emailsubscription(\"foo@bar.com\"))\n```\n\nthe email being subscribed can also be [tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tokens.html), that resolve\nto an email address during deployment. a typical use case is when the email address is passed in as a [cloudformation\nparameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudformation/latest/userguide/parameters-section-structure.html). the\nfollowing code defines a cloudformation parameter and uses it in an email subscription.\n\n```python\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"topic\")\nemail_address = cfnparameter(self, \"email-param\")\n\nmy_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.emailsubscription(email_address.value_as_string))\n```\n\nnote that email subscriptions require confirmation by visiting the link sent to the\nemail address.\n\n### sms\n\nsubscribe an sms number to your topic:\n\n```python\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"topic\")\n\nmy_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.smssubscription(\"+15551231234\"))\n```\n\nthe number being subscribed can also be [tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tokens.html), that resolve\nto a number during deployment. a typical use case is when the number is passed in as a [cloudformation\nparameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudformation/latest/userguide/parameters-section-structure.html). the\nfollowing code defines a cloudformation parameter and uses it in an sms subscription.\n\n```python\nmy_topic = sns.topic(self, \"topic\")\nsms_number = cfnparameter(self, \"sms-param\")\n\nmy_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.smssubscription(sms_number.value_as_string))\n```\n",
