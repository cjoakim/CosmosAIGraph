  "description": "a convenient function to download to a file using requests.\n\nbasic usage:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    url = \"https://github.com/takluyver/requests_download/archive/master.zip\"\n    download(url, \"requests_download.zip\")\n\nan optional ``headers=`` parameter is passed through to requests.\n\n**trackers** are a lightweight way to monitor the data being downloaded.\ntwo trackers are included:\n\n- ``progresstracker`` - displays a progress bar, using the `progressbar2\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar2>`_ package.\n- ``hashtracker`` - wraps a hashlib object to calculate a hash (e.g. sha256 or\n  md5) of the file as you download it.\n\nhere's an example of using both of them:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import hashlib\n    # progressbar is provided by progressbar2 on pypi.\n    from progressbar import datatransferbar\n    from requests_download import download, hashtracker, progresstracker\n\n    hasher = hashtracker(hashlib.sha256())\n    progress = progresstracker(datatransferbar())\n\n    download('https://github.com/takluyver/requests_download/archive/master.zip',\n             'requests_download.zip', trackers=(hasher, progress))\n\n    assert hasher.hashobj.hexdigest() == '...'\n\nto make your own tracker, subclass trackerbase and define any of these methods:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from requests_download import trackerbase\n\n    class mytracker(trackerbase):\n        def on_start(self, response):\n            \"\"\"called with requests.response object, which has response headers\"\"\"\n            pass\n\n        def on_chunk(self, chunk):\n            \"\"\"called multiple times, with bytestrings of data received\"\"\"\n            pass\n\n        def on_finish(self):\n            \"\"\"called when the download has completed\"\"\"\n            pass\n",
