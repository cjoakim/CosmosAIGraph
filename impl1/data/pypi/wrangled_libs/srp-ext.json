  "description": "\n\nthis package provides an implementation of the secure remote password\nprotocol (srp). srp is a cryptographically strong authentication\nprotocol for password-based, mutual authentication over an insecure\nnetwork connection.\n\nunlike other common challenge-response autentication protocols, such\nas kerberos and ssl, srp does not rely on an external infrastructure\nof trusted key servers or certificate management. instead, srp server\napplications use verification keys derived from each user's password\nto determine the authenticity of a network connection.\n\nsrp provides mutual-authentication in that successful authentication\nrequires both sides of the connection to have knowledge of the\nuser's password. if the client side lacks the user's password or the\nserver side lacks the proper verification key, the authentication will\nfail.\n\nunlike ssl, srp does not directly encrypt all data flowing through\nthe authenticated connection. however, successful authentication does\nresult in a cryptographically strong shared key that can be used\nfor symmetric-key encryption.\n\nfor a full description of the pysrp package and the srp protocol,\nplease refer to the `srp module documentation`_.\n\n.. _`srp module documentation`: http://packages.python.org/srp\n\n",
