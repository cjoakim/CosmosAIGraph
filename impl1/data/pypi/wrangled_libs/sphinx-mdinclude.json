(rst does not support this feature)\n* heading with overline-and-underline is not supported.\n  * heading with underline is ok\n* rst heading marks are currently hard-coded and unchangeable.\n  * h1: `=`, h2: `-`, h3: `^`, h4: `~`, h5: `\"`, h6: `#`\n\n## installation\n\npython 3.6 or newer is required.\n\n```\npip install sphinx-mdinclude\n```\n\n## usage\n\nin your sphinx `conf.py`, add the following lines:\n\n```python\nextensions = [\n    ...,\n    'sphinx_mdinclude',\n]\n```\n\nmarkdown files with the `.md` extension will be loaded and used by sphinx, similar to\nany other `.rst` files.\n\nto include markdown files within other files, use the `.. mdinclude:: <filename>`\ndirective. this applies the conversion from markdown to restructuredtext format.\n\n## license\n\n`sphinx-mdinclude` is copyright hiroyuki takagi, crossnox, and [amethyst reese][],\nand licensed under the mit license. i am providing code in this repository to you\nunder an open source license. this is my personal repository; the license you receive\nto my code is from me and not from my employer. see the [license][] file for details.\n\n[amethyst reese]: https://noswap.com\n[license]: https://github.com/omnilib/sphinx-mdinclude/blob/main/license\n\n",
