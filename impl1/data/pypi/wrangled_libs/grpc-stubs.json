  "description": "grpc typing stubs for python\n============================\n\nthis is a pep-561-compliant stub-only package which provides type information of\n[grpc](https://grpc.io>).\n\ninstall using pip:\n\n    pip install grpc-stubs\n\n\ntests (courtesy of [pytest-mypy-plugins](https://github.com/typeddjango/pytest-mypy-plugins>):\n\n    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n    ./tools.sh test\n\n\n## python support\n\ngrpc-stubs is tested with 3.7 or later, but ideally it should support python 3.6 as\ngrpc still supports this. python 3.6 had to be disabled in the tests due to\nvarious cascading fiascos and a lack of time to contend with them. feel free\nto submit a pr if you'd like to see it returned, or open issues. ensure that\nyou supply an mre as per the contributing guidelines below.\n\n\n## contributing\n\n### minimum reproducible examples (mre)\n\nunfortunately, due to the fussy nature of `grpc` and its dependencies, and the\nhuge amount of time required to construct a context in which to verify and\ndebug issues, starting from 2022-04-16, fairly strict issue and pull request\ntemplates have been added.\n\nminimum reproducible examples are now a hard requirement for pull requests that\ntouch the typing surface, and a soft requirement for issues. prs without a\nfunctioning mre transfer the burden entirely from the contributor to the\nmaintainer, and i simply don't have time to do the deep-dives required to build\nout mres from scratch when issues inevitably crop up. prs without a trivially\nexecutable mre will be closed without further consideration; of course you are\nalways welcome to reopen once you have added a verified mre!\n\n\n### tests\n\nthis project uses a slightly old version of\nhttps://github.com/typeddjango/pytest-mypy-plugins for testing. all new\ncontributions will be required to include at least one, but probably multiple\ntests. see `typesafety/test_*.yml`.\n\n\n### code-generated stubs\n\nprs containing auto-generated stubs have had to be reverted several times due\nto issues. starting from 2022-04-16, autogenerated stubs from `mypy-protobuf`\nwill not be accepted without extensive tests, and will not be accepted with\nedit warnings left in. it's ok to use this tool to seed stubs, but not to\nrefresh stubs - once contributed to this repo, the stubs should be presumed to\nhave been written by hand.\n\n\n## calls for assistance\n\nthere are several areas where `grpc-stubs` could use some tlc. if you'd like to\nhelp with any of this, please reach out!\n\n\n### maintainers\n\nit's unlikely i'll be returning to grpc full-time for the foreseeable future,\nand my knowledge of the minutiae fades with each passing year. if anyone wishes\nto assume maintainership of this project ongoing, please reach out.\n\n\n## other very useful typed python stuff\n\n- https://github.com/typeddjango\n- https://github.com/typeddjango/pytest-mypy-plugins\n- https://github.com/typeddjango/awesome-python-stubs\n\n\n\n",
