  "description": "\n\n**scikit-build** is a python build system for cpython c/c++/fortran/cython\nextensions using cmake.\n\nthe scikit-build package is fundamentally just glue between the ``setuptools``\npython module and `cmake`_.\n\nthe next generation of scikit-build, `scikit-build-core`_, is currently under development.\nthis provides a simple, reliable build backend for cmake that does not use\nsetuptools and provides a lot of new features. scikit-build-core can also power\na setuptools-based extension system, which will eventually become the backend\nfor scikit-build (classic). if you do not require extensive customization of\nthe build process, you should consider trying scikit-build-core instead of\nscikit-build.\n\nto get started, see `this example <https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#example-of-setup-py-cmakelists-txt-and-pyproject-toml>`_. for more examples, see `scikit-build-sample-projects <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-sample-projects>`_.\n\n\n\n\nscikit-build 0.17.6\n===================\n\na small fix release with some new platforms and better testing, including cpython 3.12.0b1.\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n* support added for sunos by `@mtelka <https://github.com/mtelka>`_ in `#983 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/983>`_.\n* support added for aix (with recent cmake) by `@bhuntsman <https://github.com/bhuntsman>`_ in `#988 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/988>`_.\n\ntesting\n-------\n\n* tests now pass on cpython 3.12.0b1 in `#879 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879>`_.\n* tests no longer use ``pytest-virtualenv`` in `#879 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879>`_.\n* ``isolated`` marker now includes ``test_distribution`` tests in `#879 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879>`_.\n* tests avoid incorrect ``get_map`` match by `@keszybz <https://github.com/keszybz>`_ in `#990 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/990>`_.\n* fedora testing fix by `@lecrisut <https://github.com/lecrisut>`_ in `#986 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/986>`_ and `#938 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/938>`_.\n\nmiscellaneous\n-------------\n\n* docs improvements in `#979 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/979>`_.\n\nscikit-build 0.17.5\n===================\n\na small fix release fixing the passing on of generator specific arguments. this\nfixes some cases where the ninja generator was found but then was unable to\nbuild. netbsd was reported to work, so was added to the bsd's supported.\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n* generator args were missing for actual compile in `#975 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/975>`_.\n* add support for netbsd & pyodide (future) in `#977 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/977>`_.\n\n\n\nscikit-build 0.17.4\n===================\n\na followup fix to the issue 0.17.3 tried to fix. we now have a method to\nmanually test downstream packages, too.\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n* make sure include dir is found even if the lib is not present in `#974 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/974>`_.\n\nscikit-build 0.17.3\n===================\n\na small release related to ``python_library`` handling changes in 0.17.2;\nscikit-build 0.17.3 returns an empty string from ``get_python_library`` if no\npython library is present (like on manylinux), where 0.17.2 returned none, and\nprevious versions returned a non-existent path. note that adding ``required``\nto ``find_package(pythonlibs`` will fail, but it is incorrect (you must not\nlink to ``libpython.so``) and was really just injecting a non-existent path\nbefore.\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n* keep ``get_python_library``  return type string if python lib non-existing\n  for now in `#959 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/959>`_.\n* avoid 'not found' warning if libs are not found by findpythonextensions in `#960 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/960>`_.\n* findnumpy should not call findpythonlibs in `#958 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/958>`_.\n\nscikit-build 0.17.2\n===================\n\nanother small release with fixes for non-msvc windows platforms.\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n* rpm spec fix by `@lecrisut <https://github.com/lecrisut>`_ in `#937 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/937>`_.\n* validate value before returning library path by `@dlech <https://github.com/dlech>`_ in `#942 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/942>`_.\n* only add ``python_library`` on windows msvc in `#943 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/943>`_ and `#944 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/944>`_.\n* slightly nicer traceback for failed compiler in `#947 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/947>`_.\n\ntesting\n-------\n* hide a few warnings that are expected in `#948 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/948>`_.\n\nscikit-build 0.17.1\n===================\n\nthis is a small release fixing a few bugs; the primary one being a change that\nwas triggering a bug in older findpython. the unused variable messages have\nbeen deactivated to simplify output, as well.\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n* older (<3.24) cmake breaks when lib specified in `#932 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/932>`_.\n* an error output was missing formatting in `#931 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/931>`_.\n* make empty ``cmake_osx_deployment_target`` a warning (bug in conda-forge's\n  clang activation fixed upstream) in `#934 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/934>`_.\n* remove unused variable warnings by in `#930 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/930>`_.\n\ntesting\n-------\n\n* add fedora packaging with packit automation by `@lecrisut <https://github.com/lecrisut>`_ in `#928 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/928>`_.\n* fix codecov ci by `@lecrisut <https://github.com/lecrisut>`_ in `#929 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/929>`_.\n* update some coverage settings in `#933 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/933>`_.\n\n\n\nscikit-build 0.17.0\n===================\n\na lot of bug fixes are present in this release, focusing on windows, pypy, and\ncross compiling. we've also improved the compatibility with default setuptools\nbehaviors a little, and enabled some things that were previously unavailable,\nlike overriding the build type via the cmake argument environment variables.\nwe've expanded our ci matrix to include windows and macos pypy and some fortran\ntests on linux. this release requires python 3.7+.\n\nbug fixes\n---------\n\n* match setuptools behavior for ``include_package_data`` default. by `@vyasr <https://github.com/vyasr>`_ in `#873 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/873>`_.\n* misc. fixes for f2py and
