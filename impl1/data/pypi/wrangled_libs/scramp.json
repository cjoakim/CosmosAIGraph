the tuple ``(salt, stored_key, server_key, iteration_count)`` which is stored\n  in the authentication database on the server side. it has the following parameters:\n\n  ``password``\n    the user's password as a ``str``.\n\n  ``iteration_count``\n    the rounds as an ``int``. if ``none`` then use the minimum associated with the\n    mechanism.\n  ``salt``\n    it's sometimes useful to set this

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.sslsocket.get_channel_binding>`_.\n    the convenience function ``scramp.make_channel_binding()`` can be used to create a\n    channel binding tuple. if ``channel_binding`` is provided and the mechanism isn't a\n    ``-plus`` variant, then the server will negotiate with the client to use the\n    ``-plus`` variant if the client supports it, or otherwise to use the mechanism\n    without channel binding.\n\n  ``s_nonce``\n    the server nonce as a ``str``. it's sometimes useful to set this when testing /\n    debugging, but in production this should be omitted, in which case ``scramserver``\n    will generate a server nonce.\n\n``make_stored_server_keys(salted_password)``\n    returns ``(stored_key, server_key)`` tuple of ``bytes`` objects given a salted\n    password. this is useful if you want to use a separate hashing implementation from\n    the one provided by scramp. it takes the following parameter:\n\n

``channel_binding`` parameter is provided. previously this would raise and\n  exception.\n\n\nversion 1.4.1, 2021-08-25\n`````````````````````````\n\n- when using ``make_channel_binding()`` to create a tls-server-end-point channel\n  binding, support certificates with hash algorithm of sha512.\n\n\nversion 1.4.0, 2021-03-28\n`````````````````````````\n\n- raise an exception if the client receives an error from the server.\n\n\nversion 1.3.0, 2021-03-28\n`````````````````````````\n\n- as the specification allows, server errors are now sent to the client in the\n  ``server_final`` message, an exception is still thrown as before.\n\n\nversion 1.2.2, 2021-02-13\n`````````````````````````\n\n- fix bug in generating the authmessage. it was incorrect when channel binding\n  was used. so now scramp supports channel binding.\n\n\nversion 1.2.1, 2021-02-07\n`````````````````````````\n\n- add support for channel binding.\n\n- add support for scram-sha-512 and scram-sha3-512 and their channel binding\n  variants.\n\n\nversion 1.2.0, 2020-05-30\n`````````````````````````\n\n- this is a backwardly incompatible change on the server side, the client side will\n  work as before. the idea of this change is to make it possible to have an\n  authentication database. that is, the authentication information can be stored, and\n  then retrieved when needed to authenticate the user.\n\n- in addition, it's now possible on the server side to use a third party hashing library\n  such as passlib as the hashing implementation.\n\n\nversion 1.1.1, 2020-03-28\n`````````````````````````\n\n- add the readme and licence to the distribution.\n\n\nversion 1.1.0, 2019-02-24\n`````````````````````````\n\n- add support for the scram-sha-1 mechanism.\n\n\nversion 1.0.0, 2019-02-17\n`````````````````````````\n\n- implement the server side as well as the client side.\n\n\nversion 0.0.0, 2019-02-10\n`````````````````````````\n\n- copied scram implementation from `pg8000 <https://github.com/tlocke/pg8000>`_. the\n  idea is to make it a general scram implemtation. credit to the `scrampy\n  <https://github.com/cagdass/scrampy>`_ project which i read through to help with
