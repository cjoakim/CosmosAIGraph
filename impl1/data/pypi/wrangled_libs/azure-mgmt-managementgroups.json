  "description": "## microsoft azure sdk for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure management groups client library.\n\nazure resource manager (arm) is the next generation of management apis\nthat replace the old azure service management (asm).\n\nthis package has been tested with python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.\n\nfor the older azure service management (asm) libraries, see\n[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)\nlibrary.\n\nfor a more complete set of azure libraries, see the\n[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).\n\n## usage\n\n\nto learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)\n\n\n\nfor docs and references, see [python sdk references](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)\ncode samples for this package can be found at [management management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=getting%20started%20-%20managing&terms=getting%20started%20-%20managing) on docs.microsoft.com.\nadditional code samples for different azure services are available at [samples repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)\n\n\n## provide feedback\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in\nthe [issues](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project.\n\n![image](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fazure-mgmt-managementgroups%2freadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 1.0.0 (2021-05-21)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model managementgroupdetails has a new parameter path\n  - model managementgroupdetails has a new parameter management_group_ancestors\n  - model managementgroupdetails has a new parameter management_group_ancestors_chain\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - operation managementgroupsubscriptionsoperations.get_subscriptions_under_management_group has a new signature\n  - operation managementgroupsoperations.list has a new signature\n  - operation entitiesoperations.list has a new signature\n  - operation managementgroupsoperations.get_descendants has a new signature\n  - model managementgroup no longer has parameter path\n\n## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-09)\n\nthis is beta preview version.\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\n- credential system has been completly revamped:\n\n  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\n  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`\n\n- the `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. example: `myclient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=true)`. for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n- you can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead\n- operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.lropoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.lropoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.\n- exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror` (`clouderror` has been removed).\n- most of the operation kwarg have changed. some of the most noticeable:\n\n  - `raw` has been removed. equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal http response for advanced user\n  - for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n\n**general new features**\n\n- type annotations support using `typing`. sdks are mypy ready.\n- this client has now stable and official support for async. check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.\n- this client now support natively tracing library like opencensus or opentelemetry. see this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.\n\n## 0.2.0 (2019-02-21)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model entityinfo has a new parameter number_of_children\n  - model entityinfo has a new parameter number_of_child_groups\n\n## 0.1.0 (2018-05-31)\n\n  - initial release\n\n\n",
