  "description": "=======================================\ncbor-diag: diagnostic notation for cbor\n=======================================\n\nthis python module is a minimal wapper around the `cbor-diag crate`_.\nunlike the crate,\nwhich offers lots of functionality for manipulating an ast,\nthis module only exposes two very simple functions:\n\n* ``diag2cbor``, which parses diagnostic notation and produces a corresponding cbor binary string, and\n* ``cbor2diag``, which does the inverse.\n\nit is recommended to use the cbor2_ package to actually process the cbor data.\n\ndocumentation is available `on readthedocs`_.\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nthis project can be installed `from pypi`_;\nbinary wheels are available there for the common platforms.\n\nmaintenance\n===========\n\nthis package is considered feature-complete at release,\nand maintainened reactively --\nwhen changes to the ecosystem threaten to make it unusable.\n\nnew features are only expected to be added\nif they are already present in the underlying `cbor-diag crate`_,\nand will likely manifest as extra arguments to ``cbor2diag``.\n\nthis package is built using maturin_ and pyo3_\nand largely follows their template.\nthe built module is renamed from ``cbor_diag`` to ``_cbor_diag``\n(and consequently wrapped manually)\nto avoid it being part of the package's public api.\n\nthe package is currently hosted on github at https://github.com/chrysn/cbor-diag-py\nbecause maturin can `not yet`_ build pipelines for gitlab or codeberg.\n\nlicense\n=======\n\nthis package was written by christian ams\u00fcss <chrysn@fsfe.org>,\nand is published under the terms of mit_ or apache-2.0_ license,\nat the user's choice.\n\ncredit for its functionality goes to nemo157\nas the maintainer of the underlying `cbor-diag crate`_.\n\n.. _`cbor-diag crate`: https://crates.io/crates/cbor-diag\n.. _cbor2: https://pypi.org/project/cbor2/\n.. _`on readthedocs`: https://cbor-diag.readthedocs.io/\n.. _`from pypi`: https://pypi.org/project/cbor-diag/\n.. _maturin: https://www.maturin.rs/\n.. _pyo3: https://pyo3.rs/\n.. _`not yet`: https://github.com/pyo3/maturin/issues/1507\n.. _mit: https://spdx.org/licenses/mit.html\n.. _apache-2.0: https://spdx.org/licenses/apache-2.0.html\n\n",
