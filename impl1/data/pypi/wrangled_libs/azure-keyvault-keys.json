  "description": "# azure key vault keys client library for python\nazure key vault helps solve the following problems:\n- cryptographic key management (this library) - create, store, and control\naccess to the keys used to encrypt your data\n- secrets management\n([azure-keyvault-secrets](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets)) -\nsecurely store and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, api keys,\nand other secrets\n- certificate management\n([azure-keyvault-certificates](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-certificates)) -\ncreate, manage, and deploy public and private ssl/tls certificates\n- vault administration ([azure-keyvault-administration](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-administration)) - role-based access control (rbac), and vault-level backup and restore options\n\n[source code][library_src]\n| [package (pypi)][pypi_package_keys]\n| [package (conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-keyvault/)\n| [api reference documentation][reference_docs]\n| [product documentation][azure_keyvault]\n| [samples][key_samples]\n\n## _disclaimer_\n\n_azure sdk python packages support for python 2.7 has ended 01 january 2022. for more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_.\n\n_python 3.7 or later is required to use this package. for more details, please refer to [azure sdk for python version support policy](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/azure-sdks-python-version-support-policy)._\n\n## getting started\n### install the package\ninstall [azure-keyvault-keys][pypi_package_keys] and\n[azure-identity][azure_identity_pypi] with [pip][pip]:\n```bash\npip install azure-keyvault-keys azure-identity\n```\n[azure-identity][azure_identity] is used for azure active directory\nauthentication as demonstrated below.\n\n### prerequisites\n* an [azure subscription][azure_sub]\n* python 3.7 or later\n* an existing [azure key vault][azure_keyvault]. if you need to create one, you can do so using the azure cli by following the steps in [this document][azure_keyvault_cli].\n* if using managed hsm, an existing [key vault managed hsm][managed_hsm]. if you need to create a managed hsm, you can do so using the azure cli by following the steps in [this document][managed_hsm_cli].\n\n### authenticate the client\nin order to interact with the azure key vault service, you will need an instance of a [keyclient][key_client_docs], as well as a **vault url** and a credential object. this document demonstrates using a [defaultazurecredential][default_cred_ref], which is appropriate for most scenarios, including local development and production environments. we recommend using a [managed identity][managed_identity] for authentication in production environments.\n\nsee [azure-identity][azure_identity] documentation for more information about other methods of authentication and their corresponding credential types.\n\n#### create a client\nafter configuring your environment for the [defaultazurecredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create a key client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your vault's url):\n\n<!-- snippet:hello_world.create_a_key_client -->\n\n```python\nvault_url = os.environ[\"vault_url\"]\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\nclient = keyclient(vault_url=vault_url, credential=credential)\n```\n\n<!-- end snippet -->\n\n> **note:** for an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.keys.aio`'s `keyclient` instead.\n\n## key concepts\n### keys\nazure key vault can create and store rsa and elliptic curve keys. both can\noptionally be protected by hardware security modules (hsms). azure key vault\ncan also perform cryptographic operations with them. for more information about\nkeys and supported operations and algorithms, see the\n[key vault documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys).\n\n[keyclient][key_client_docs] can create keys in the vault, get existing keys\nfrom the vault, update key metadata, and delete keys, as shown in the\n[examples](#examples) below.\n\n## examples\nthis section contains code snippets covering common tasks:\n* [create a key](#create-a-key)\n* [retrieve a key](#retrieve-a-key)\n* [update an existing key](#update-an-existing-key)\n* [delete a key](#delete-a-key)\n* [configure automatic key rotation](#configure-automatic-key-rotation)\n* [list keys](#list-keys)\n* [perform cryptographic operations](#cryptographic-operations)\n* [async api](#async-api)\n* [asynchronously create a key](#asynchronously-create-a-key)\n* [asynchronously list keys](#asynchronously-list-keys)\n\n### create a key\n[create_rsa_key](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient.create_rsa_key) and\n[create_ec_key](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient.create_ec_key)\ncreate rsa and elliptic curve keys in the vault, respectively. if a key with the same name already exists, a new version\nof that key is created.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\n\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\n\n# create an rsa key\nrsa_key = key_client.create_rsa_key(\"rsa-key-name\", size=2048)\nprint(rsa_key.name)\nprint(rsa_key.key_type)\n\n# create an elliptic curve key\nec_key = key_client.create_ec_key(\"ec-key-name\", curve=\"p-256\")\nprint(ec_key.name)\nprint(ec_key.key_type)\n```\n\n### retrieve a key\n[get_key](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient.get_key) retrieves a key\npreviously stored in the vault.\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\n\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\nkey = key_client.get_key(\"key-name\")\nprint(key.name)\n```\n\n### update an existing key\n[update_key_properties](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient.update_key_properties)\nupdates the properties of a key previously stored in the key vault.\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\n\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\n\n# we will now disable the key for further use\nupdated_key = key_client.update_key_properties(\"key-name\", enabled=false)\n\nprint(updated_key.name)\nprint(updated_key.properties.enabled)\n```\n\n### delete a key\n[begin_delete_key](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient.begin_delete_key)\nrequests key vault delete a key, returning a poller which allows you to wait for the deletion to finish. waiting is\nhelpful when the vault has [soft-delete][soft_delete] enabled, and you want to purge (permanently delete) the key as\nsoon as possible. when [soft-delete][soft_delete] is disabled, `begin_delete_key` itself is permanent.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\n\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\ndeleted_key = key_client.begin_delete_key(\"key-name\").result()\n\nprint(deleted_key.name)\nprint(deleted_key.deleted_date)\n```\n\n### configure automatic key rotation\n[update_key_rotation_policy](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-keyvault-keys/4.5.0b5/azure.keyvault.keys.html#azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient.update_key_rotation_policy)\nallows you to configure automatic key rotation for a key by specifying a rotation policy.\nin addition,\n[rotate_key](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-keyvault-keys/4.5.0b5/azure.keyvault.keys.html#azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient.rotate_key)\nallows you to rotate a key on-demand by creating a new version of the given key.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient, keyrotationlifetimeaction, keyrotationpolicyaction\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\n\n# set the key's automated rotation policy to rotate the key 30 days before the key expires\nactions = [keyrotationlifetimeaction(keyrotationpolicyaction.rotate, time_before_expiry=\"p30d\")]\n# you may also specify the duration after which the newly rotated key will expire\n# in this example, any new key versions will expire after 90 days\nupdated_policy = key_client.update_key_rotation_policy(\"key-name\", expires_in=\"p90d\", lifetime_actions=actions)\n\n# you can get the current rotation policy for a key with get_key_rotation_policy\ncurrent_policy = key_client.get_key_rotation_policy(\"key-name\")\n\n# finally, you can rotate a key on-demand by creating a new version of the key\nrotated_key = key_client.rotate_key(\"key-name\")\n```\n\n### list keys\n[list_properties_of_keys](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient.list_properties_of_keys)\nlists the properties of all of the keys in the client's vault.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\n\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\nkeys = key_client.list_properties_of_keys()\n\nfor key in keys:\n    # the list doesn't include values or versions of the keys\n    print(key.name)\n```\n\n### cryptographic operations\n[cryptographyclient](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/crypto/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.crypto.cryptographyclient)\nenables cryptographic operations (encrypt/decrypt, wrap/unwrap, sign/verify) using a particular key.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys.crypto import cryptographyclient, encryptionalgorithm\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\n\nkey = key_client.get_key(\"key-name\")\ncrypto_client = cryptographyclient(key, credential=credential)\nplaintext = b\"plaintext\"\n\nresult = crypto_client.encrypt(encryptionalgorithm.rsa_oaep, plaintext)\ndecrypted = crypto_client.decrypt(result.algorithm, result.ciphertext)\n```\n\nsee the\n[package documentation][crypto_client_docs]\nfor more details of the cryptography api.\n\n### async api\nthis library includes a complete set of async apis. to use them, you must\nfirst install an async transport, such as [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/).\nsee\n[azure-core documentation](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#transport)\nfor more information.\n\nasync clients and credentials should be closed when they're no longer needed. these\nobjects are async context managers and define async `close` methods. for\nexample:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity.aio import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys.aio import keyclient\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\n\n# call close when the client and credential are no longer needed\nclient = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\n...\nawait client.close()\nawait credential.close()\n\n# alternatively, use them as async context managers (contextlib.asyncexitstack can help)\nclient = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\nasync with client:\n  async with credential:\n    ...\n```\n\n### asynchronously create a key\n[create_rsa_key](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/aio/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.aio.keyclient.create_rsa_key) and\n[create_ec_key](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/aio/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.aio.keyclient.create_ec_key)\ncreate rsa and elliptic curve keys in the vault, respectively. if a key with the same name already exists, a new\nversion of the key is created.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity.aio import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys.aio import keyclient\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\n\n# create an rsa key\nrsa_key = await key_client.create_rsa_key(\"rsa-key-name\", size=2048)\nprint(rsa_key.name)\nprint(rsa_key.key_type)\n\n# create an elliptic curve key\nec_key = await key_client.create_ec_key(\"ec-key-name\", curve=\"p-256\")\nprint(ec_key.name)\nprint(ec_key.key_type)\n```\n\n### asynchronously list keys\n[list_properties_of_keys](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/keyvault-keys/aio/docs#azure.keyvault.keys.aio.keyclient.list_properties_of_keys)\nlists the properties of all of the keys in the client's vault.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity.aio import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys.aio import keyclient\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\nkeys = key_client.list_properties_of_keys()\n\nasync for key in keys:\n    print(key.name)\n```\n\n## troubleshooting\n\nsee the `azure-keyvault-keys`\n[troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys/troubleshooting.md)\nfor details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.\n\n### general\nkey vault clients raise exceptions defined in [azure-core][azure_core_exceptions].\nfor example, if you try to get a key that doesn't exist in the vault, [keyclient][key_client_docs]\nraises [resourcenotfounderror](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-core-exceptions-resource-not-found-error):\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient\nfrom azure.core.exceptions import resourcenotfounderror\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\nkey_client = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential)\n\ntry:\n    key_client.get_key(\"which-does-not-exist\")\nexcept resourcenotfounderror as e:\n    print(e.message)\n```\n\n### logging\nthis library uses the standard\n[logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library for logging.\nbasic information about http sessions (urls, headers, etc.) is logged at info\nlevel.\n\ndetailed debug level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted\nheaders, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` argument:\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.keyvault.keys import keyclient\nimport sys\nimport logging\n\n# create a logger for the 'azure' sdk\nlogger = logging.getlogger('azure')\nlogger.setlevel(logging.debug)\n\n# configure a console output\nhandler = logging.streamhandler(stream=sys.stdout)\nlogger.addhandler(handler)\n\ncredential = defaultazurecredential()\n\n# this client will log detailed information about its http sessions, at debug level\nclient = keyclient(vault_url=\"https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/\", credential=credential, logging_enable=true)\n```\n\nsimilarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single operation,\neven when it isn't enabled for the client:\n```python\nclient.get_key(\"my-key\", logging_enable=true)\n```\n\n## next steps\nseveral samples are available in the azure sdk for python github repository.\nthese provide example code for additional key vault scenarios:\n| file | description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| [hello_world.py][hello_world_sample] ([async version][hello_world_async_sample]) | create/get/update/delete keys |\n| [list_operations.py][list_operations_sample] ([async version][list_operations_async_sample]) | basic list operations for keys |\n| [backup_restore_operations.py][backup_operations_sample] ([async version][backup_operations_async_sample]) | back up and recover keys |\n| [recover_purge_operations.py][recover_purge_sample] ([async version][recover_purge_async_sample]) | recover and purge keys |\n| [send_request.py][send_request_sample] | use the `send_request` client method |\n\n###  additional documentation\nfor more extensive documentation on azure key vault, see the\n[api reference

`keyoperation`, and `keytype`, respectively.\n- `key` now has attribute `properties`, which holds certain properties of the\nkey, such as `version`. this changes the shape of the returned `key` type,\nas certain properties of `key` (such as `version`) have to be accessed\nthrough the `properties` property.\n\n- `update_key` has been renamed to `update_key_properties`\n- the `vault_url` parameter of `keyclient` has been renamed to `vault_endpoint`\n- the property `vault_url` has been renamed to `vault_endpoint` in all models\n\n### fixes and improvements:\n- the `key` argument to

api in preparation for a\nrevamped configuration api. static `create_config` methods have been renamed\n`_create_config`, and will be removed in a future release.\n- removed `wrap_key` and `unwrap_key` from `keyclient`. these are now available\nthrough `cryptographyclient`.\n- this version of the library requires `azure-core` 1.0.0b2\n  - if you later want to revert to a version requiring azure-core 1.0.0b1,\n  of this or another azure sdk library, you must explicitly install azure-core\n  1.0.0b1 as well. for example:\n  `pip install azure-core==1.0.0b1 azure-keyvault-keys==4.0.0b1`\n\n### new features:\n- added `cryptographyclient`, a client for performing cryptographic operations\n(encrypt/decrypt, wrap/unwrap, sign/verify) with a key.\n- distributed tracing framework opencensus is now supported\n- added support for http challenge based authentication, allowing clients to\ninteract with vaults in sovereign clouds.\n\n### other changes:\n- async clients use [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) for transport\nby default. see\n[azure-core documentation](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/readme.md/#transport)\nfor more information about using other transports.\n\n## 4.0.0b1 (2019-06-28)\nversion 4.0.0b1 is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly\nand pythonic client library for azure key vault. for more information about\npreview releases of other azure sdk libraries, please visit\nhttps://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview1-python.\n\nthis library is not a direct replacement for `azure-keyvault`. applications\nusing that library would require code changes to use `azure-keyvault-keys`.\nthis package's\n[documentation](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys/readme.md)\nand\n[samples](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys/samples)\ndemonstrate the new api.\n\n### major changes from `azure-keyvault`\n- packages scoped by functionality\n    - `azure-keyvault-keys` contains a client for key operations,\n    `azure-keyvault-secrets` contains a client for secret operations\n- client instances are scoped to vaults (an instance interacts with one vault\nonly)\n- asynchronous api supported on python 3.5.3+\n    - the `azure.keyvault.keys.aio` namespace contains an async equivalent of\n    the synchronous client in `azure.keyvault.keys`\n- authentication using `azure-identity` credentials\n  - see this package's\n  [documentation](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys/readme.md)\n  , and the\n  [azure identity documentation](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/readme.md)\n  for more information\n\n### `azure-keyvault` features not implemented in this release\n- certificate management apis\n- cryptographic operations, e.g. sign, un/wrap_key, verify, en- and\ndecrypt\n- national cloud support. this release supports public global cloud vaults,\n    e.g. https://{vault-name}.vault.azure.net\n",
