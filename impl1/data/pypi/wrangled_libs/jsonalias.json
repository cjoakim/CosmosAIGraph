  "description": "# jsonalias\n\na microlibrary that defines a `json` type alias for python.\n\n## this readme is longer than the library\n\nseriously, this is all the code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import dict, list, union\n\njson = union[dict[str, \"json\"], list[\"json\"], str, int, float, bool, none]\n```\n\nif we only supported python >= 3.10, it would fit on one line:\n\n```python\njson = dict[str, 'json'] | list['json'] | str | int | float | bool | none\n```\n\n## then why make a library out of it?\n\ni want to use this type alias in multiple projects and it's\njust about long enough to be annoying.\n\nthis alias should probably get added to the python `typing` module.\nif it does and i haven't put a big notice on this readme,\nplease open a pr.\n\n## example\n\n```python\nfrom jsonalias import json\n\nd: json = {\"foo\": [\"bar\", {\"x\": \"y\"}]}\n```\n\n## it's not working please help???\n\nmake sure you're using mypy >= 0.981 and running with the\n`--enable-recursive-aliases` flag.\n\n## special thanks\n\ngithub user wbolster for [this comment](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/182#issuecomment-1259412066)\nnotifying us that mypy could now do json.\n",
