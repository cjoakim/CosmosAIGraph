  "description": "altgraph is a fork of graphlib: a graph (network) package for constructing\ngraphs, bfs and dfs traversals, topological sort, shortest paths, etc. with\ngraphviz output.\n\naltgraph includes some additional usage of python 2.6+ features and\nenhancements related to modulegraph and macholib.\n\nproject links\n-------------\n\n* `documentation <https://altgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_\n\n* `issue tracker <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/altgraph/issues>`_\n\n* `repository <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/altgraph/>`_\n\n\nrelease history\n===============\n\n0.17.3\n------\n\n* update classifiers for python 3.11\n\n0.17.2\n------\n\n* change in setup.py to fix the sidebar links on pypi\n\n0.17.1\n------\n\n* explicitly mark python 3.10 as supported in wheel metadata.\n\n0.17\n----\n\n* explicitly mark python 3.8 as supported in wheel metadata.\n\n* migrate from bitbucket to github\n\n* run black on the entire repository\n\n0.16.1\n------\n\n* explicitly mark python 3.7 as supported in wheel metadata.\n\n0.16\n----\n\n* add license file\n\n0.15\n----\n\n* ``objectgraph.get_edges``, ``objectgraph.getedgedata`` and ``objectgraph.updateedgedata``\n  accept *none* as the node to get and treat this as an alias for *self* (as other\n  methods already did).\n\n0.14\n----\n\n- issue #7: remove use of ``iteritems`` in altgraph.graphalgo code\n\n0.13\n----\n\n- issue #4: graph._bfs_subgraph and back_bfs_subgraph return subgraphs with reversed edges\n\n  fix by \"pombredanne\" on bitbucket.\n\n\n0.12\n----\n\n- added ``objectgraph.edgedata`` to retrieve the edge data\n  from a specific edge.\n\n- added ``altgraph.update_edge_data`` and ``objectgraph.updateedgedata``\n  to update the data associated with a graph edge.\n\n0.11\n----\n\n- stabilize the order of elements in dot file exports,\n  patch from bitbucket user 'pombredanne'.\n\n- tweak setup.py file to remove dependency on distribute (but\n  keep the dependency on setuptools)\n\n\n0.10.2\n------\n\n- there where no classifiers in the package metadata due to a bug\n  in setup.py\n\n0.10.1\n------\n\nthis is a bugfix release\n\nbug fixes:\n\n- issue #3: the source archive contains a readme.txt\n  while the setup file refers to readme.txt.\n\n  this is caused by a misfeature in distutils, as a\n  workaround i've renamed readme.txt to readme.txt\n  in the source tree and setup file.\n\n\n0.10\n-----\n\nthis is a minor feature release\n\nfeatures:\n\n- do not use \"2to3\" to support python 3.\n\n  as a side effect of this altgraph now supports\n  python 2.6 and later, and no longer supports\n  earlier releases of python.\n\n- the order of attributes in the dot output\n  is now always alphabetical.\n\n  with this change the output will be consistent\n  between runs and python versions.\n\n0.9\n---\n\nthis is a minor bugfix release\n\nfeatures:\n\n- added ``altgraph.objectgraph.objectgraph.nodes``, a method\n  yielding all nodes in an object graph.\n\nbugfixes:\n\n- the 0.8 release didn't work with py2app when using\n  python 3.x.\n\n\n0.8\n-----\n\nthis is a minor feature release. the major new feature\nis a extensive set of unittests, which explains almost\nall other changes in this release.\n\nbugfixes:\n\n- installing failed with python 2.5 due to using a distutils\n  class that isn't available in that version of python\n  (issue #1 on the issue tracker)\n\n- ``altgraph.graphstat.degree_dist`` now actually works\n\n- ``altgraph.graph.add_edge(a, b, create_nodes=false)`` will\n  no longer create the edge when one of the nodes doesn't\n  exist.\n\n- ``altgraph.graph.forw_topo_sort`` failed for some sparse graphs.\n\n- ``altgraph.graph.back_topo_sort`` was completely broken in\n  previous releases.\n\n- ``altgraph.graph.forw_bfs_subgraph`` now actually works.\n\n- ``altgraph.graph.back_bfs_subgraph`` now actually works.\n\n- ``altgraph.graph.iterdfs`` now returns the correct result\n  when the ``forward`` argument is ``false``.\n\n- ``altgraph.graph.iterdata`` now returns the correct result\n  when the ``forward`` argument is ``false``.\n\n\nfeatures:\n\n- the ``altgraph.graph`` constructor now accepts an argument\n  that contains 2- and 3-tuples instead of requireing that\n  all items have the same size. the (optional) argument can now\n  also be any iterator.\n\n- ``altgraph.graph.graph.add_node`` has no effect when you\n  add a hidden node.\n\n- the private method ``altgraph.graph._bfs`` is no longer\n  present.\n\n- the private method ``altgraph.graph._dfs`` is no longer\n  present.\n\n- ``altgraph.objectgraph`` now has a ``__contains__`` methods,\n  which means you can use the ``in`` operator to check if a\n  node is part of a graph.\n\n- ``altgraph.graphutil.generate_random_graph`` will raise\n  ``grapherror`` instead of looping forever when it is\n  impossible to create the requested graph.\n\n- ``altgraph.dot.edge_style`` raises ``grapherror`` when\n  one of the nodes is not present in the graph. the method\n  silently added the tail in the past, but without ensuring\n  a consistent graph state.\n\n- ``altgraph.dot.save_img`` now works when the mode is\n  ``\"neato\"``.\n\n0.7.2\n-----\n\nthis is a minor bugfix release\n\nbugfixes:\n\n- distutils didn't include the documentation subtree\n\n0.7.1\n-----\n\nthis is a minor feature release\n\nfeatures:\n\n- documentation is now generated using `sphinx <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx>`_\n  and can be viewed at <http://packages.python.org/altgraph>.\n\n- the repository has moved to bitbucket\n\n- ``altgraph.graphstat.avg_hops`` is no longer present, the function had no\n  implementation and no specified behaviour.\n\n- the module ``altgraph.compat`` is gone, which means altgraph will no\n  longer work with python 2.3.\n\n\n0.7.0\n-----\n\nthis is a minor feature release.\n\nfeatures:\n\n- support for python 3\n\n- it is now possible to run tests using 'python setup.py test'\n\n  (the actual testsuite is still very minimal though)\n",
