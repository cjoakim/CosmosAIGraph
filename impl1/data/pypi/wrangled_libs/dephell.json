[pyproject.toml build-system requires](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/#build-system-table) (`pyproject`)\n\n## usage\n\nfirst of all, install dephell and activate autocomplete:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install --user dephell[full]\ndephell self autocomplete\n```\n\nlet's get [sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) and make it better.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject.git\ncd sampleproject\n```\n\nthis project uses [setup.py](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html) for dependencies and metainfo. however, this format is over-complicated for most projects. let's convert it into [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/pyproject/):\n\n```bash\ndephell deps convert --from=setup.py --to=pyproject.toml\n```\n\nit will make next `pyproject.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"sampleproject\"\nversion = \"1.2.0\"\ndescription = \"a sample python project\"\nauthors = [\"the python packaging authority <pypa-dev@googlegroups.com>\"]\nreadme = \"readme.md\"\n\n[tool.poetry.scripts]\nsample = \"sample:main\"\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*,<4,>=2.7\"\ncoverage = {optional = true}\npeppercorn = \"*\"\n\n[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]\ncheck-manifest = \"*\"\n\n[tool.poetry.extras]\ntest = [\"coverage\"]\n```\n\nnow, let's generate some useful files:\n\n```bash\ndephell generate authors\n\ndephell generate license mit\n\n# https://editorconfig.org/\ndephell generate editorconfig\n```\n\nour users probably have not installed poetry, but they are likely to have pip and can install files from setup.py. let's make it easier to generate `setup.py` from our `pyproject.toml`. also, it points to dephell as your default dependencies file. add the following lines in the `pyproject.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[tool.dephell.main]\nfrom = {format = \"poetry\", path = \"pyproject.toml\"}\nto = {format = \"setuppy\", path = \"setup.py\"}\n```\n\nyou can see a full, real-world example of a config in [dephell's own pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml).\n\nnow we can call dephell commands without explicitly specifying `from` and `to`:\n\n```bash\ndephell deps convert\n```\n\nit will make setup.py and readme.rst from pyproject.toml and readme.md.\n\nnow let's test our code in a virtual environment:\n\n```bash\n$ dephell venv run pytest\nwarning venv does not exist, creating... (project=/home/gram/documents/sampleproject, env=main, path=/home/gram/.local/share/dephell/venvs/sampleproject-whg0/main)\ninfo venv created (path=/home/gram/.local/share/dephell/venvs/sampleproject-whg0/main)\nwarning executable does not found in venv, trying to install... (executable=pytest)\ninfo build dependencies graph...\ninfo installation...\n# ... pip output\n# ... pytest output\n```\n\nwe can now activate the virtual environment for our project and run any commands inside:\n\n```bash\ndephell venv shell\n```\n\nugh, we have tests, but don't have `pytest` in our dependencies file. let's add it:\n\n```bash\ndephell deps add --envs dev test -- pytest\n```\n\nafer that our dev-dependencies looks like this:\n\n```toml\n[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]\ncheck-manifest = \"*\"\npytest = \"*\"\n\n[tool.poetry.extras]\ntest = [\"coverage\", \"pytest\"]\n```\n\neventually we will have many more dependencies. let's look at how many of them we have now:\n\n```bash\n$ dephell deps tree\n- check-manifest [required: *, locked: 0.37, latest: 0.37]\n- coverage [required: *, locked: 4.5.3, latest: 4.5.3]\n- peppercorn [required: *, locked: 0.6, latest: 0.6]\n- pytest [required: *, locked: 4.4.0, latest: 4.4.0]\n  - atomicwrites [required: >=1.0, locked: 1.3.0, latest: 1.3.0]\n  - attrs [required: >=17.4.0, locked: 19.1.0, latest: 19.1.0]\n  - colorama [required: *, locked: 0.4.1, latest: 0.4.1]\n  - funcsigs [required: >=1.0, locked: 1.0.2, latest: 1.0.2]\n  - more-itertools [required: <6.0.0,>=4.0.0, locked: 5.0.0, latest: 7.0.0]\n    - six [required: <2.0.0,>=1.0.0, locked: 1.12.0, latest: 1.12.0]\n  - more-itertools [required: >=4.0.0, locked: 7.0.0, latest: 7.0.0]\n  - pathlib2 [required: >=2.2.0, locked: 2.3.3, latest: 2.3.3]\n    - scandir [required: *, locked: 1.10.0, latest: 1.10.0]\n    - six [required: *, locked: 1.12.0, latest: 1.12.0]\n  - pluggy [required: >=0.9, locked: 0.9.0, latest: 0.9.0]\n  - py [required: >=1.5.0, locked: 1.8.0, latest: 1.8.0]\n  - setuptools [required: *, locked: 41.0.0, latest: 41.0.0]\n  - six [required: >=1.10.0, locked: 1.12.0, latest: 1.12.0]\n```\n\nhm...is it as many as it seems? let's look at their size.\n\n```bash\n$ dephell inspect venv --filter=lib_size\n11.96mb\n```\n\nugh...ok, it's python. are they actual?\n\n```bash\n$ dephell deps outdated\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"more routines for operating on iterables, beyond itertools\",\n    \"installed\": [\n      \"5.0.0\"\n    ],\n    \"latest\": \"7.0.0\",\n    \"name\": \"more-itertools\",\n    \"updated\": \"2019-03-28\"\n  },\n]\n```\n\n`pytest` requires old version of `more-itertools`. that happens.\n\nif our tests and dependencies are ok, it's time to deploy. first of all, increment the project version:\n\n```bash\n$ dephell project bump minor\ninfo generated new version (old=1.2.0, new=1.3.0)\n```\n\nand then build packages:\n\n```bash\n$ dephell project build\ninfo dumping... (format=setuppy)\ninfo dumping... (format=egginfo)\ninfo dumping... (format=sdist)\ninfo dumping... (format=wheel)\ninfo builded\n```\n\nnow, we can upload these packages to [pypi](https://pypi.org/):\n\n```bash\ndephell self auth upload.pypi.org my-username my-password\ndephell project upload\n```\n\nthese are some of the most useful commands. see [documentation](https://dephell.org/docs/) for more details.\n\n## compatibility\n\ndephell is tested on linux and mac os x with python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7. and one of the coolest things is that dephell is run by dephell on travis ci.\n\ndephell works on windows but has no ci to keep in working yet.\n\n## how can i help\n\n1. star project on github. developers believe in the stars.\n1. tell your fellows that [gram](http://github.com/orsinium) has a made [cool thing](https://github.com/dephell/dephell) for you.\n1. [open an issue](https://github.com/dephell/dephell/issues/new) if you have thoughts on how to make dephell better.\n1. things that you can contribute in any project in [dephell ecosystem](https://github.com/dephell):\n    1. fix grammar and typos.\n    1. document new things.\n    1. tests, we always need more tests.\n    1. make readmes more nice and friendly.\n    1. view issues with the [help wanted](https://github.com/dephell/dephell/issues?q=is%3aissue+is%3aopen+label%3a%22help+wanted%22) label to find things that you can fix.\n    1. anything what you want. if it is a new feature, please, open an issue before writing the code.\n\nthank you :heart:\n",
