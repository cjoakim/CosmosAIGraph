(the following is merely an example)\npublish_app_role = iam.role(self, \"publishapprole\",\n    assumed_by=iam.accountrootprincipal()\n)\n\nprofiling_group = codeguruprofiler.profilinggroup(self, \"myprofilinggroup\")\nprofiling_group.grant_publish(publish_app_role)\n```\n\n## compute platform configuration\n\ncode guru profiler supports multiple compute environments.\nthey can be configured when creating a profiling group by using the `computeplatform` property:\n\n```python\nprofiling_group = codeguruprofiler.profilinggroup(self, \"myprofilinggroup\",\n    compute_platform=codeguruprofiler.computeplatform.aws_lambda\n)\n```\n",
