  "description": "text progress bar library for python.\n\na text progress bar is typically used to display the progress of a long\nrunning operation, providing a visual cue that processing is underway.\n\nthe progressbar class manages the current progress, and the format of the line\nis given by a number of widgets. a widget is an object that may display\ndifferently depending on the state of the progress bar. there are three types\nof widgets:\n - a string, which always shows itself\n\n - a progressbarwidget, which may return a different value every time its\n   update method is called\n\n - a progressbarwidgethfill, which is like progressbarwidget, except it\n   expands to fill the remaining width of the line.\n\nthe progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. it will also\nautomatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.",
