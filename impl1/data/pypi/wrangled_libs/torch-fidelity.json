  "description": "\nevaluation of generative models such as gans is an important part of the deep learning research. \nin the domain of 2d image generation, three approaches became widely spread: inception score \n(aka is), fr\u00e9chet inception distance (aka fid), and kernel inception distance (aka kid).\n\nthese metrics, despite having a clear mathematical and algorithmic description, were initially \nimplemented in tensorflow, and inherited a few properties of the framework itself and the code \nthey relied upon. these design decisions were effectively baked into the evaluation protocol and \nbecame an inherent part of the metrics specification. as a result, researchers wishing to \ncompare against state of the art in generative modeling are forced to perform evaluation using \ncodebases of the original metric authors. reimplementations of metrics in pytorch and other \nframeworks exist, but they do not provide a proper level of fidelity, thus making them \nunsuitable for reporting results and comparing to other methods.   \n\nthis software aims to provide epsilon-exact implementations of the said metrics in pytorch, and thus \nremove inconveniences associated with generative models evaluation and development. \nfind more details and the most up-to-date information on the project webpage:\nhttps://www.github.com/toshas/torch-fidelity\n\n\n",
