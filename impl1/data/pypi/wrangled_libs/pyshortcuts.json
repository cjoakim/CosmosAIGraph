  "description": "\npyshortcuts helps developers and python users to create shortcuts on a\nusers desktop or start menu that will run python scripts and applications.\npyshortcuts is cross-platform, supporting windows, macos, and linux each in\nthe way most natural for the os.  on windows, a shortcut or link is\ncreated.  on linux a \".desktop\" file is created.  on macos, a minimal\napplication is created.  in all cases, the shortcuts are put either\ndirectly on the desktop or start menu , or in a folder on the desktop or\nstart menu of the current user.  that means that there is not need for\nelevated permission or writing to system-level files (registry,\n/applications, /usr/bin).  the user has complete control to rename, move,\nor delete the shortcut after it is created.  shortcuts can have a custom\nicon (`.ico` files on windows or linux, or `.icns` files on macos)\nspecified, defaulting to a python icon included with the pyshortcuts\nmodule. pyshortcuts is pure python, has a small footprint and is very easy\nto install and use either from a python script.  that is to say, it can\neasily be part of a installation (or post-installation process) process for\nlarger packages.\n",
