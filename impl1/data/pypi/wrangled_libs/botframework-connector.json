https://dev.azure.com/fuselabs/sdk_v4/_apis/build/status/python/python-ci-pr-yaml?branchname=master\n   :target:  https://dev.azure.com/fuselabs/sdk_v4/_apis/build/status/python/python-ci-pr-yaml?branchname=master\n   :align: right\n   :alt: azure devops status for master branch\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/botframework-connector.svg\n   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/botframework-connector\n   :alt: latest pypi package version\n\nwithin the bot framework, the bot connector service enables your bot to exchange messages with users on channels that are configured in the bot framework portal.\n\nhow to install\n==============\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  pip install botframework-connector\n\nhow to use\n==========\n\nauthentication\n==============\n\nyour bot communicates with the bot connector service using http over a secured channel (ssl/tls). when your bot sends a request to the connector service, it must include information that the connector service can use to verify its identity.\n\nto authenticate the requests, you'll need configure the connector with the app id and password that you obtained for your bot during registration and the connector will handle the rest.\n\nmore information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-connector-authentication\n\nexample\n=======\n\nclient creation (with authentication), conversation initialization and activity send to user.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  from botbuilder.schema import *\n  from botframework.connector import connectorclient\n  from botframework.connector.auth import microsoftappcredentials\n\n  app_id = '<your-app-id>'\n  app_password = '<your-app-password>'\n  service_url = 'https://slack.botframework.com'\n  channel_id = 'slack'\n  bot_id = '<bot-id>'\n  recipient_id = '<user-id>'\n\n  credentials = microsoftappcredentials(app_id, app_password)\n  connector = connectorclient(credentials, base_url=service_url)\n\n  conversation = connector.conversations.create_conversation(conversationparameters(\n              bot=channelaccount(id=bot_id),\n              members=[channelaccount(id=recipient_id)]))\n\n  connector.conversations.send_to_conversation(conversation.id, activity(\n              type=activitytypes.message,\n              channel_id=channel_id,\n              recipient=channelaccount(id=recipient_id),\n              from_property=channelaccount(id=bot_id),\n              text='hello world!'))\n\n\nrest api documentation\n======================\n\nfor the
