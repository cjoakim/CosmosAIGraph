  "description": "# pyspx [![sphincs python bindings](https://github.com/sphincs/pyspx/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sphincs/pyspx/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)\n\nthis repository contains a python package that provides bindings for [sphincs+](https://github.com/sphincs/sphincsplus). it provides support for all parameter sets included as part of [the sphincs+ submission](http://sphincs.org/data/sphincs+-specification.pdf) to [nist's post-quantum cryptography standardization project](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).\n\nwhile this package is functionally complete, it may still be subject to small api changes.\ncurrently, the bindings only wrap the reference code. code optimized for specific platforms (such as machines with avx2 or aesni support) is ignored.\n\n### installation\n\nthe package is [available on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyspx/) and can be installed by simply calling `pip install pyspx`.\n\nfor linux, binary wheels are available based on the `manylinux1` docker image. on other platforms it may take a few moments to compile the sphincs+ code. currently the `sphincsplus` reference code requires `openssl` for its sha256 function. when compiling from source, be sure to install openssl with development files.\n\n### api\n\nafter installing the package, import a specific instance of sphincs+ as follows (e.g. for `shake256-128f`):\n\n```\nimport pyspx.shake256_128f\n```\n\nthis exposes the following straight-forward functions. all parameters are assumed to be `bytes` objects. similarly, the returned keys and signatures are `bytes`. the `verify` function returns a boolean indicating success or failure.\n\n```\n>>> public_key, secret_key = pyspx.shake256_128f.generate_keypair(seed)\n>>> signature = pyspx.shake256_128f.sign(message, secret_key)\n>>> pyspx.shake256_128f.verify(message, signature, public_key)\ntrue\n```\n\nadditionally, the following attributes expose the expected sizes, as a consequence of the selected parameter set:\n\n```\n>>> pyspx.shake256_128f.crypto_sign_bytes\n29792\n>>> pyspx.shake256_128f.crypto_sign_publickeybytes\n64\n>>> pyspx.shake256_128f.crypto_sign_secretkeybytes\n128\n>>> pyspx.shake256_128f.crypto_sign_seedbytes\n96\n```\n\n### custom sphincs+ parameters\n\nit is fairly easy to compile with additional sphincs+ parameters.\nto do this, clone the repository, initialize the `src/sphincsplus` submodule,\nand add a new parameter set to `src/sphincsplus/ref/params`.\nmake sure to follow the `params-sphincs-[parameters-shorthand].h` naming convention.\ninstalling the python package from this modified source will expose the parameter set using the api described above.\n",
