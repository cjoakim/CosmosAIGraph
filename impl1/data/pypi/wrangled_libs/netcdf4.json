  "description": "netcdf version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of the library,\nsuch as hierarchical groups, zlib compression, multiple unlimited dimensions,\nand new data types.  it is implemented on top of hdf5.  this module implements\nmost of the new features, and can read and write netcdf files compatible with\nolder versions of the library.  the api is modelled after scientific.io.netcdf,\nand should be familiar to users of that module.\n",
