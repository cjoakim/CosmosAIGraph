... attach commands to cli object\n\n```\n\nnow we need a `pluginmanager` (which has a generic type) to load the plugins for us:\n\n```python\ncli = # ... needs to come from somewhere\n\nmanager: pluginmanager[cliplugin] = pluginmanager(\"my.plugins.cli\", load_args=(cli,))\n\nplugins: list[cliplugin] = manager.load_all()\n\n# todo: do stuff with the plugins, if you want/need\n#  in this example, we simply use the plugin mechanism to run a one-shot function (attach) on a load argument\n\n```\n\n### re-usable plugins\n\nwhen you have lots of plugins that are structured in a similar way, we may not want to create a separate plugin class\nfor each plugin. instead we want to use the same `plugin` class to do the same thing, but use several instances of it.\nthe `pluginfactory`, and the fact that `pluginspec` instances defined at module level are discoverable (inpired\nby [pluggy](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy)), can be used to achieve that.\n\n```python\n\nclass serviceplugin(plugin):\n\n    def __init__(self, service_name):\n        self.service_name = service_name\n        self.service = none\n\n    def should_load(self):\n        return self.service_name in config.services\n\n    def load(self):\n        module = importlib.import_module(\"localstack.services.%s\" % self.service_name)\n        # suppose we define a convention that each service module has a service class, like moto's `backend`\n        self.service = module.service()\n\ndef service_plugin_factory(name) -> pluginfactory:\n    def create():\n        return serviceplugin(name)\n\n    return create\n\n# discoverable\ns3 = pluginspec(\"localstack.plugins.services\", \"s3\", service_plugin_factory(\"s3\"))\n\n# discoverable\ndynamodb = pluginspec(\"localstack.plugins.services\", \"dynamodb\", service_plugin_factory(\"dynamodb\"))\n\n# ... could be simplified with convenience framework code, but the principle will stay the same\n\n```\n\nthen we could use the `pluginmanager` to build a supervisor\n\n```python\n\nclass supervisor:\n    manager: pluginmanager[serviceplugin]\n\n    def start(self, service_name):\n        plugin = manager.load(service_name)\n        service = plugin.service\n        service.start()\n\n```\n\n### functions as plugins\n\nwith the `@plugin` decorator, you can expose functions as plugins. they will be wrapped by the framework\ninto `functionplugin` instances, which satisfy both the contract of a plugin, and that of the function.\n\n```python\nfrom plugin import plugin\n\n\n@plugin(namespace=\"localstack.configurators\")\ndef configure_logging(runtime):\n    logging.basicconfig(level=runtime.config.loglevel)\n\n    \n@plugin(namespace=\"localstack.configurators\")\ndef configure_somethingelse(runtime):\n    # do other stuff with the runtime object\n    pass\n```\n\nwith a pluginmanager via `load_all`, you receive the `functionplugin` instances, that you can call like the functions\n\n```python\n\nruntime = localstackruntime()\n\nfor configurator in pluginmanager(\"localstack.configurators\").load_all():\n    configurator(runtime)\n```\n\nconfiguring your distribution\n-----------------------------\n\nif you are building a python distribution that exposes plugins discovered by plux, you need to configure your projects build system so other dependencies creates the `entry_points.txt` file when installing your distribution.\n\nfor a [`pyproject.toml`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) template this involves adding the `build-system` section:\n\n```toml\n[build-system]\nrequires = ['setuptools', 'wheel', 'plux>=1.3.1']\nbuild-backend = \"setuptools.build_meta\"\n\n# ...\n```\n\ninstall\n-------\n\n    pip install plux\n\ndevelop\n-------\n\ncreate the virtual environment, install dependencies, and run tests\n\n    make venv\n    make test\n\nrun the code formatter\n\n    make format\n\nupload the pypi package using twine\n\n    make upload\n",
