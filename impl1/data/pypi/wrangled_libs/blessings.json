  "description": "=========\nblessings\n=========\n\ncoding with blessings looks like this... ::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    t = terminal()\n\n    print t.bold('hi there!')\n    print t.bold_red_on_bright_green('it hurts my eyes!')\n\n    with t.location(0, t.height - 1):\n        print 'this is at the bottom.'\n\nor, for byte-level control, you can drop down and play with raw terminal\ncapabilities::\n\n    print '{t.bold}all your {t.red}bold and red base{t.normal}'.format(t=t)\n    print t.wingo(2)\n\n`full api reference <https://blessings.readthedocs.io/>`_\n\nthe pitch\n=========\n\nblessings lifts several of curses_' limiting assumptions, and it makes your\ncode pretty, too:\n\n* use styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without necessarily\n  clearing the whole\n  screen first.\n* leave more than one screenful of scrollback in the buffer after your program\n  exits, like a well-behaved command-line app should.\n* get rid of all those noisy, c-like calls to ``tigetstr`` and ``tparm``, so\n  your code doesn't get crowded out by terminal bookkeeping.\n* act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file, omitting the\n  terminal control codes the user doesn't want to see (optional).\n\n.. _curses: http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html\n\nbefore and after\n----------------\n\nwithout blessings, this is how you'd print some underlined text at the bottom\nof the screen::\n\n    from curses import tigetstr, setupterm, tparm\n    from fcntl import ioctl\n    from os import isatty\n    import struct\n    import sys\n    from termios import tiocgwinsz\n\n    # if we want to tolerate having our output piped to other commands or\n    # files without crashing, we need to do all this branching:\n    if hasattr(sys.stdout, 'fileno') and isatty(sys.stdout.fileno()):\n        setupterm()\n        sc = tigetstr('sc')\n        cup = tigetstr('cup')\n        rc = tigetstr('rc')\n        underline = tigetstr('smul')\n        normal = tigetstr('sgr0')\n    else:\n        sc = cup = rc = underline = normal = ''\n    print sc  # save cursor position.\n    if cup:\n        # tigetnum('lines') doesn't always update promptly, hence this:\n        height = struct.unpack('hhhh', ioctl(0, tiocgwinsz, '\\000' * 8))[0]\n        print tparm(cup, height - 1, 0)  # move cursor to bottom.\n    print 'this is {under}underlined{normal}!'.format(under=underline,\n                                                      normal=normal)\n    print rc  # restore cursor position.\n\nthat was long and full of incomprehensible trash! let's try it again, this time\nwith blessings::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    with term.location(0, term.height - 1):\n        print 'this is', term.underline('pretty!')\n\nmuch better.\n\nwhat it provides\n================\n\nblessings provides just one top-level object: ``terminal``. instantiating a\n``terminal`` figures out whether you're on a terminal at all and, if so, does\nany necessary terminal setup. after that, you can proceed to ask it all sorts\nof things about the terminal. terminal terminal terminal.\n\nsimple formatting\n-----------------\n\nlots of handy formatting codes (\"capabilities\" in low-level parlance) are\navailable as attributes on a ``terminal``. for example::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    print 'i am ' + term.bold + 'bold' + term.normal + '!'\n\nthough they are strings at heart, you can also use them as callable wrappers so\nyou don't have to say ``normal`` afterward::\n\n    print 'i am', term.bold('bold') + '!'\n\nor, if you want fine-grained control while maintaining some semblance of\nbrevity, you can combine it with python's string formatting, which makes\nattributes easy to access::\n\n    print 'all your {t.red}base {t.underline}are belong to us{t.normal}'.format(t=term)\n\nsimple capabilities of interest include...\n\n* ``bold``\n* ``reverse``\n* ``underline``\n* ``no_underline`` (which turns off underlining)\n* ``blink``\n* ``normal`` (which turns off everything, even colors)\n\nhere are a few more which are less likely to work on all terminals:\n\n* ``dim``\n* ``italic`` and ``no_italic``\n* ``shadow`` and ``no_shadow``\n* ``standout`` and ``no_standout``\n* ``subscript`` and ``no_subscript``\n* ``superscript`` and ``no_superscript``\n* ``flash`` (which flashes the screen once)\n\nnote that, while the inverse of ``underline`` is ``no_underline``, the only way\nto turn off ``bold`` or ``reverse`` is ``normal``, which also cancels any\ncustom colors. this is because there's no portable way to tell the terminal to\nundo certain pieces of formatting, even at the lowest level.\n\nyou might also notice that the above aren't the typical incomprehensible\nterminfo capability names; we alias a few of the harder-to-remember ones for\nreadability. however, you aren't limited to these: you can reference any\nstring-returning capability listed on the `terminfo man page`_ by the name\nunder the \"cap-name\" column: for example, ``term.rum``.\n\n.. _`terminfo man page`: http://www.manpagez.com/man/5/terminfo/\n\ncolor\n-----\n\n16 colors, both foreground and background, are available as easy-to-remember\nattributes::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    print term.red + term.on_green + 'red on green? ick!' + term.normal\n    print term.bright_red + term.on_bright_blue + 'this is even worse!' + term.normal\n\nyou can also call them as wrappers, which sets everything back to normal at the\nend::\n\n    print term.red_on_green('red on green? ick!')\n    print term.yellow('i can barely see it.')\n\nthe available colors are...\n\n* ``black``\n* ``red``\n* ``green``\n* ``yellow``\n* ``blue``\n* ``magenta``\n* ``cyan``\n* ``white``\n\nyou can set the background color instead of the foreground by prepending\n``on_``, as in ``on_blue``. there is also a ``bright`` version of each color:\nfor example, ``on_bright_blue``.\n\nthere is also a numerical interface to colors, which takes an integer from\n0-15::\n\n    term.color(5) + 'hello' + term.normal\n    term.on_color(3) + 'hello' + term.normal\n\n    term.color(5)('hello')\n    term.on_color(3)('hello')\n\nif some color is unsupported (for instance, if only the normal colors are\navailable, not the bright ones), trying to use it will, on most terminals, have\nno effect: the foreground and background colors will stay as they were. you can\nget fancy and do different things depending on the supported colors by checking\n`number_of_colors`_.\n\n.. _`number_of_colors`: http://packages.python.org/blessings/#blessings.terminal.number_of_colors\n\ncompound formatting\n-------------------\n\nif you want to do lots of crazy formatting all at once, you can just mash it\nall together::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    print term.bold_underline_green_on_yellow + 'woo' + term.normal\n\nor you can use your newly coined attribute as a wrapper, which implicitly sets\neverything back to normal afterward::\n\n    print term.bold_underline_green_on_yellow('woo')\n\nthis compound notation comes in handy if you want to allow users to customize\nthe formatting of your app: just have them pass in a format specifier like\n\"bold_green\" on the command line, and do a quick ``getattr(term,\nthat_option)('your text')`` when you do your formatting.\n\ni'd be remiss if i didn't credit couleur_, where i probably got the idea for\nall this mashing.\n\n.. _couleur: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/couleur\n\nmoving the cursor\n-----------------\n\nwhen you want to move the cursor to output text at a specific spot, you have\na few choices.\n\nmoving temporarily\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nmost often, you'll need to flit to a certain location, print something, and\nthen return: for example, when updating a progress bar at the bottom of the\nscreen. ``terminal`` provides a context manager for doing this concisely::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    with term.location(0, term.height - 1):\n        print 'here is the bottom.'\n    print 'this is back where i came from.'\n\nparameters to ``location()`` are ``x`` and then ``y``, but you can also pass\njust one of them, leaving the other alone. for example... ::\n\n    with term.location(y=10):\n        print 'we changed just the row.'\n\nif you're doing a series of ``move`` calls (see below) and want to return the\ncursor to its original position afterward, call ``location()`` with no\narguments, and it will do only the position restoring::\n\n    with term.location():\n        print term.move(1, 1) + 'hi'\n        print term.move(9, 9) + 'mom'\n\nnote that, since ``location()`` uses the terminal's built-in\nposition-remembering machinery, you can't usefully nest multiple calls. use\n``location()`` at the outermost spot, and use simpler things like ``move``\ninside.\n\nmoving permanently\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nif you just want to move and aren't worried about returning, do something like\nthis::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    print term.move(10, 1) + 'hi, mom!'\n\n``move``\n  position the cursor elsewhere. parameters are y coordinate, then x\n  coordinate.\n``move_x``\n  move the cursor to the given column.\n``move_y``\n  move the cursor to the given row.\n\nhow does all this work? these are simply more terminal capabilities, wrapped to\ngive them nicer names. the added wrinkle--that they take parameters--is also\ngiven a pleasant treatment: rather than making you dig up ``tparm()`` all the\ntime, we simply make these capabilities into callable strings. you'd get the\nraw capability strings if you were to just print them, but they're fully\nparametrized if you pass params to them as if they were functions.\n\nconsequently, you can also reference any other string-returning capability\nlisted on the `terminfo man page`_ by its name under the \"cap-name\" column.\n\n.. _`terminfo man page`: http://www.manpagez.com/man/5/terminfo/\n\none-notch movement\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nfinally, there are some parameterless movement capabilities that move the\ncursor one character in various directions:\n\n* ``move_left``\n* ``move_right``\n* ``move_up``\n* ``move_down``\n\nfor example... ::\n\n    print term.move_up + 'howdy!'\n\nheight and width\n----------------\n\nit's simple to get the height and width of the terminal, in characters::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    height = term.height\n    width = term.width\n\nthese are newly updated each time you ask for them, so they're safe to use from\nsigwinch handlers.\n\nclearing the screen\n-------------------\n\nblessings provides syntactic sugar over some screen-clearing capabilities:\n\n``clear``\n  clear the whole screen.\n``clear_eol``\n  clear to the end of the line.\n``clear_bol``\n  clear backward to the beginning of the line.\n``clear_eos``\n  clear to the end of screen.\n\nfull-screen mode\n----------------\n\nperhaps you have seen a full-screen program, such as an editor, restore the\nexact previous state of the terminal upon exiting, including, for example, the\ncommand-line prompt from which it was launched. curses pretty much forces you\ninto this behavior, but blessings makes it optional. if you want to do the\nstate-restoration thing, use these capabilities:\n\n``enter_fullscreen``\n    switch to the terminal mode where full-screen output is sanctioned. print\n    this before you do any output.\n``exit_fullscreen``\n    switch back to normal mode, restoring the exact state from before\n    ``enter_fullscreen`` was used.\n\nusing ``exit_fullscreen`` will wipe away any trace of your program's output, so\nreserve it for when you don't want to leave anything behind in the scrollback.\n\nthere's also a context manager you can use as a shortcut::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    with term.fullscreen():\n        # print some stuff.\n\nbesides brevity, another advantage is that it switches back to normal mode even\nif an exception is raised in the ``with`` block.\n\npipe savvy\n----------\n\nif your program isn't attached to a terminal, like if it's being piped to\nanother command or redirected to a file, all the capability attributes on\n``terminal`` will return empty strings. you'll get a nice-looking file without\nany formatting codes gumming up the works.\n\nif you want to override this--like if you anticipate your program being piped\nthrough ``less -r``, which handles terminal escapes just fine--pass\n``force_styling=true`` to the ``terminal`` constructor.\n\nin any case, there is a ``does_styling`` attribute on ``terminal`` that lets\nyou see whether your capabilities will return actual, working formatting codes.\nif it's false, you should refrain from drawing progress bars and other frippery\nand just stick to content, since you're apparently headed into a pipe::\n\n    from blessings import terminal\n\n    term = terminal()\n    if term.does_styling:\n        with term.location(0, term.height - 1):\n            print 'progress: [=======>   ]'\n    print term.bold('important stuff')\n\nshopping list\n=============\n\nthere are decades of legacy tied up in terminal interaction, so attention to\ndetail and behavior in edge cases make a difference. here are some ways\nblessings has your back:\n\n* uses the terminfo database so it works with any terminal type\n* provides up-to-the-moment terminal height and width, so you can respond to\n  terminal size changes (sigwinch signals). (most other libraries query the\n  ``columns`` and ``lines`` environment variables or the ``cols`` or ``lines``\n  terminal capabilities, which don't update promptly, if at all.)\n* avoids making a mess if the output gets piped to a non-terminal\n* works great with standard python string templating\n* provides convenient access to all terminal capabilities, not just a sugared\n  few\n* outputs to any file-like object, not just stdout\n* keeps a minimum of internal state, so you can feel free to mix and match with\n  calls to curses or whatever other terminal libraries you like\n\nblessings does not provide...\n\n* native color support on the windows command prompt. however, it should work\n  when used in concert with colorama_.\n\n.. _colorama: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama/0.2.4\n\nbugs\n====\n\nbugs or suggestions? visit the `issue tracker`_.\n\n.. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/erikrose/blessings/issues/\n\nblessings tests are run automatically by `travis ci`_.\n\n.. _`travis ci`: https://travis-ci.org/erikrose/blessings/\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/erikrose/blessings.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/erikrose/blessings\n\n\nlicense\n=======\n\nblessings is under the mit license. see the license file.\n\nversion history\n===============\n\n1.7\n  * drop support for python 2.6 and 3.3, which are end-of-lifed.\n  * switch from 2to3 to the ``six`` library.\n\n1.6.1\n  * don't crash if ``number_of_colors()`` is called when run in a non-terminal\n    or when ``does_styling`` is otherwise false.\n\n1.6\n  * add ``does_styling`` property. this takes ``force_styling`` into account\n    and should replace most uses of ``is_a_tty``.\n  * make ``is_a_tty`` a read-only property, like ``does_styling``. writing to\n    it never would have done anything constructive.\n  * add ``fullscreen()`` and ``hidden_cursor()`` to the auto-generated docs.\n  * fall back to ``lines`` and ``columns`` environment vars to find height and\n    width. (jquast)\n  * support terminal types, such as kermit and avatar, that use bytes 127-255\n    in their escape sequences. (jquast)\n\n1.5.1\n  * clean up fabfile, removing the redundant ``test`` command.\n  * add travis support.\n  * make ``python setup.py test`` work without spurious errors on 2.6.\n  * work around a tox parsing bug in its config file.\n  * make context managers clean up after themselves even if there's an\n    exception. (vitja makarov)\n  * parametrizing a capability no longer crashes when there is no tty. (vitja\n    makarov)\n\n1.5\n  * add syntactic sugar and documentation for ``enter_fullscreen`` and\n    ``exit_fullscreen``.\n  * add context managers ``fullscreen()`` and ``hidden_cursor()``.\n  * now you can force a ``terminal`` never to emit styles by passing\n    ``force_styling=none``.\n\n1.4\n  * add syntactic sugar for cursor visibility control and single-space-movement\n    capabilities.\n  * endorse the ``location()`` idiom for restoring cursor position after a\n    series of manual movements.\n  * fix a bug in which ``location()`` wouldn't do anything when passed zeroes.\n  * allow tests to be run with ``python setup.py test``.\n\n1.3\n  * added ``number_of_colors``, which tells you how many colors the terminal\n    supports.\n  * made ``color(n)`` and ``on_color(n)`` callable to wrap a string, like the\n    named colors can. also, make them both fall back to the ``setf`` and\n    ``setb`` capabilities (like the named colors do) if the ansi ``setaf`` and\n    ``setab`` aren't available.\n  * allowed ``color`` attr to act as an unparametrized string, not just a\n    callable.\n  * made ``height`` and ``width`` examine any passed-in stream before falling\n    back to stdout. (this rarely if ever affects actual behavior; it's mostly\n    philosophical.)\n  * made caching simpler and slightly more efficient.\n  * got rid of a reference cycle between terminals and formattingstrings.\n  * updated docs to reflect that terminal addressing (as in ``location()``) is\n    0-based.\n\n1.2\n  * added support for python 3! we need 3.2.3 or greater, because the curses\n    library couldn't decide whether to accept strs or bytes before that\n    (http://bugs.python.org/issue10570).\n  * everything that comes out of the library is now unicode. this lets us\n    support python 3 without making a mess of the code, and python 2 should\n    continue to work unless you were testing types (and badly). please file a\n    bug if this causes trouble for you.\n  * changed to the mit license for better world domination.\n  * added sphinx docs.\n\n1.1\n  * added nicely named attributes for colors.\n  * introduced compound formatting.\n  * added wrapper behavior for styling and colors.\n  * let you force capabilities to be non-empty, even if the output stream is\n    not a terminal.\n  * added the ``is_a_tty`` attribute for telling whether the output stream is a\n    terminal.\n  * sugared the remaining interesting string capabilities.\n  * let ``location()`` operate on just an x *or* y coordinate.\n\n1.0\n  * extracted blessings from nose-progressive, my `progress-bar-having,\n    traceback-shortcutting, rootin', tootin' testrunner`_. it provided the\n    tootin' functionality.\n\n.. _`progress-bar-having, traceback-shortcutting, rootin', tootin' testrunner`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose-progressive/\n\n\n",
