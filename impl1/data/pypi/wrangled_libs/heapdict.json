  "description": "heapdict: a heap with decreased-key and increase-key operations\n===============================================================\n\nheapdict implements the mutablemapping abc, meaning it works pretty\nmuch like a regular python dict.  it's designed to be used as a\npriority queue, where items are added and consumed as follows:\n\n::\n\n    hd = heapdict()\n    hd[obj1] = priority1\n    hd[obj2] = priority2\n    # ...\n    (obj, priority) = hd.popitem()\n\ncompared to an ordinary dict, a heapdict has the following differences:\n\npopitem():\n    remove and return the (key, priority) pair with the lowest\n    priority, instead of a random object.\n\npeekitem():\n    return the (key, priority) pair with the lowest priority, without\n    removing it.\n\nunlike the python standard library's heapq module, the heapdict\nsupports efficiently changing the priority of an existing object\n(often called \"decrease-key\" in textbooks).  altering the priority is\nimportant for many algorithms such as dijkstra's algorithm and a*.\n\n\n\n",
