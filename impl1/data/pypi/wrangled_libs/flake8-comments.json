  "description": "# flake8-comments\n\nreport redundant comments in python code.\n\nan example of a bad comment:\n\n```python\n# create user\nuser.create(force=true)\n```\n\nin this example, the comment gives even less information that the code itself. so, you can safely remove the comment without losing any information. the goal is to reduce the [information redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/redundancy_(information_theory)), leaving in the code only what is actually important and helpful.\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install flake8-comments\n```\n\n## usage\n\ncheck that plugin was added in your flake8:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 -m flake8 --version\n3.7.7 (flake8-comments: 0.1.0, mccabe: 0.6.1, pycodestyle: 2.5.0, pyflakes: 2.1.1) cpython 3.6.7 on linux\n```\n\nif you don't see `flake8-comments` in the previous command output, check that `flake8` and `flake8-comments` is installed in the same interpreter.\n\nif everything is ok, run `flake8`:\n\n```bash\npython -m flake8 example.py\n```\n\n## similar projects\n\nthere are a few more good flake8 plugins targeted on cleaning up comments:\n\n+ [flake8-eradicate](https://github.com/wemake-services/flake8-eradicate) detects commented out code.\n+ [flake8-todos](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/flake8-todos) controls consistency of todo comments.\n+ [wemake-python-styleguide](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide) has a few checks targeted on comments, like if there are empty comments, too many `noqa`, `no cover`, bad shebangs.\n",
