(on windows, the\nodbc driver manager is built-in.)\n\nprecompiled binary wheels are provided for multiple python versions on most windows, macos,\nand linux platforms.  on other platforms pyodbc will be built from the source code.  note,\npyodbc contains c++ extensions so you will need a suitable c++ compiler when building from\nsource.  see the [docs](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/install) for details.\n\n[documentation](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki)\n\n[release notes](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/releases)\n",
