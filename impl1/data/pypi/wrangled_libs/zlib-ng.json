platform.machine == \"x86_64\" or platform.machine == \"amd64\"\n\n``setup.py``::\n\n    extras_require={\n        \":platform.machine == 'x86_64' or platform.machine == 'amd64'\": ['zlib-ng']\n    },\n\n.. dependency end\n\n.. _differences-with-zlib-and-gzip-modules:\n\ndifferences with zlib and gzip modules\n--------------------------------------\n\n.. differences start\n\n+ compression level 1 zlib_ng has a worse compression rate than that in\n  zlib. for other compression levels zlib_ng compresses better.\n+ ``gzip_ng.open`` returns a class ``gzipngfile`` instead of ``gzipfile``. since\n  there are differences between the compressed ratios between levels, a\n  difference in naming was chosen to reflect this.\n  ``gzip_ng.gzipfile`` does exist as an alias of\n  ``gzip_ng.gzipngfile`` for compatibility reasons.\n\n.. differences end\n\ncontributing\n------------\n.. contributing start\n\nplease make a pr or issue if you feel anything can be improved. bug reports\nare also very welcome. please report them on the `github issue tracker\n<https://github.com/rhpvorderman/python-zlib-ng/issues>`_.\n\n.. contributing end\n\nacknowledgements\n----------------\n\n.. acknowledgements start\n\nthis project builds upon the software and experience of many.  many thanks to:\n\n+ the `zlib-ng contributors\n  <https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng/graphs/contributors>`_ for making the\n  zlib-ng library.\n+ the `cpython contributors\n  <https://github.com/python/cpython/graphs/contributors>`_.\n  python-zlib-ng mimicks ``zlibmodule.c`` and ``gzip.py`` from the standard\n  library to make it easier for python users to adopt it.\n+ the `github actions team <https://github.com/orgs/actions/people>`_ for\n  creating the actions ci service that enables building and testing on all\n  three major operating systems.\n\n.. acknowledgements end\n",
