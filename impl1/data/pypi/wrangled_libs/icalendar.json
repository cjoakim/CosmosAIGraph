attribute to init.py.\n  [tomtry]\n\n- documentation fixes.\n  [tomtry]\n\n- pep 8, utf 8 headers, dict/list calls to literals.\n  [thet]\n\n\n3.9.1 (2015-09-08)\n------------------\n\n- fix ``vperiod.__repr__``.\n  [spacekpe]\n\n- improve foldline() performance. this improves the foldline performance,\n  especially for large strings like base64-encoded inline attachements. in some\n  cases (1mb string) from 7 minutes to less than 20ms for ascii data and 500ms\n  for non-ascii data. ref: #163.\n  [emfree]\n\n\n3.9.0 (2015-03-24)\n------------------\n\n- creating timezone objects

``component.to_ical``. setting it to\n  false allows the user to preserve the original property and parameter order.\n  ref #136. fixes #133.\n  [untitaker]\n\n- fix tests for latest ``pytz``. don't set ``tzinfo`` directly on datetime\n  objects, but use pytz's ``localize`` function. ref #138.\n  [untitaker, thet]\n\n- remove incorrect use of __all__. we don't encourage using ``from package\n  import *`` imports. fixes #129.\n  [eric-wieser]\n\n\n3.6.2 (2014-04-05)\n------------------\n\n- pep8 and cleanup.\n  [lasudry]\n\n3.6.1 (2014-01-13)\n------------------\n\n- open text files

[sochotnicky]\n\n\n3.6 (2014-01-06)\n----------------\n\n- python3 (3.3+) + python 2 (2.6+) support [geier]\n\n- made sure to_ical() always returns bytes [geier]\n\n- support adding lists to a component property, which value already was a list\n  and remove the component.set method, which was only used by the add method.\n  [thet]\n\n- remove ability to add property parameters via a value's params attribute when\n  adding via cal.add (that was only possible for custom value objects and makes\n  up a strange api), but support a parameter attribute on cal.add's method\n  signature to pass a dictionary with property parameter key/value pairs.\n  fixes #116.\n  [thet]\n\n- backport some of regebro's changes from his regebro-refactor branch.\n  [thet]\n\n- raise explicit error on another malformed content line case.\n  [hajdbo]\n\n- correctly parse datetime component property values with timezone information\n  when parsed from ical strings.\n  [untitaker]\n\n\n3.5

to unicode internally. this should fix all en/decoding errors.\n  [thet]\n\n- support for non-ascii parameter values. fixes #88.\n  [warvariuc]\n\n- added functions to transform chars in string with '\\\\' + any of r'\\,;:' chars\n  into '%{:02x}' form to avoid splitting on chars escaped with '\\\\'.\n  [warvariuc]\n\n- allow seconds in vutcoffset properties. fixes #55.\n  [thet]\n\n- let ``component.decode`` better handle vrecur and vdddlists properties.\n  fixes #70.\n  [thet]\n\n- don't let ``component.add`` re-encode already encoded values. this simplifies\n  the api, since there is no need explicitly pass ``encode=false``. fixes #82.\n  [thet]\n\n- rename tzinfo_from_dt to tzid_from_dt, which is what it does.\n  [thet]\n\n- more support for dateutil parsed tzinfo objects. fixes #89.\n  [leo-naeka]\n\n- remove python-dateutil version fix at all. current python-dateutil has py3\n  and py2 compatibility.\n  [thet]\n\n- declare the required python-dateutil dependency in setup.py. fixes #90.\n  [kleink]\n\n- raise test coverage.\n  [thet]\n\n- remove interfaces module, as it is unused.\n  [thet]\n\n- remove ``test_doctests.py``, test suite already created properly in\n  ``test_icalendar.py``.\n  [rnix]\n\n- transformed doctests into unittests, test fixes and cleanup.\n  [warvariuc]\n\n\n3.3 (2013-02-08)\n----------------\n\n- drop support for python < 2.6.\n  [thet]\n\n- allow vgeo to be instantiated with list and not only tuples of geo\n  coordinates. fixes #83.\n  [thet]\n\n- don't force to pass a list to vdddlists and allow setting individual rdate\n  and exdate values without having to wrap them in a list.\n  [thet]\n\n- fix encoding function to allow setting rdate and exdate values and not to\n  have bypass encoding with an icalendar property.\n  [thet]\n\n- allow setting of timezone for vdddlists and support timezone properties for\n  rdate and exdate component properties.\n  [thet]\n\n- move setting of tzid properties to vdddtypes, where it belongs to.\n  [thet]\n\n- use @staticmethod decorator instead of wrapper function.\n  [warvariuc, thet]\n\n- extend quoting of parameter values to all of those characters: \",;: \u00e2\u0080\u0099'\".\n  this fixes an outlook incompatibility with some characters. fixes: #79,\n  fixes: #81.\n  [warvariuc]\n\n- define vtimetzone subcomponents standard and daylight for rfc5545 compliance.\n  [thet]\n\n\n3.2 (2012-11-27)\n----------------\n\n- documentation file layout restructuring.\n  [thet]\n\n- fix time support. vtime events can be instantiated with a datetime.time\n  object, and do not inherit from datetime.time itself.\n  [rdunklau]\n\n- correctly handle tzinfo objects parsed with dateutil. fixes #77.\n  [warvariuc, thet]\n\n- text values are escaped correclty. fixes #74.\n  [warvariuc]\n\n- returned old folding algorithm, as the current implementation fails in some\n  cases. fixes #72, fixes #73.\n  [warvariuc]\n\n- supports to_ical() on date/time

[dbstovall]\n\n- localize datetimes for timezones to avoid dst transition errors.\n  [dbstovall]\n\n- allow utc-offset property value data types in seconds, which follows rfc5545\n  specification.\n  [nikolaeff]\n\n- remove utctz and normalized_timezone methods to simplify the codebase. the\n  methods were too tiny to be useful and just used at one place.\n  [thet]\n\n- when using component.add() to add icalendar properties, force a value\n  conversion to utc for created, dtstart and last-modified. the rfc expects utc\n  for those properties.\n  [thet]\n\n- removed last occurrences of old api (from_string).\n  [rembane]\n\n- add 'recursive' argument to property_items() to switch recursive listing.\n  for example when parsing a text/calendar text including multiple components\n  (e.g. a vcalendar with 5 vevents), the previous situation required us to look\n  over all properties in vevents even if we just want the properties under the\n  vcalendar component (version, prodid, calscale, method).\n  [dmikurube]\n\n- all unit tests fixed.\n  [mikaelfrykholm]\n\n\n3.0.1b2 (2012-03-01)\n--------------------\n\n- for all tzid parameters in date-time properties, use timezone identifiers\n  (e.g. europe/vienna) instead of timezone names (e.g. cet), as required by\n  rfc5545. timezone names are used together with timezone identifiers in the\n  timezone components.\n  [thet]\n\n- timezone parsing, issues and test fixes.\n  [mikaelfrykholm, garbas, tgecho]\n\n- since we use pytz for timezones, also use utc tzinfo object from the pytz\n  library instead of own implementation.\n  [thet]\n\n\n3.0.1b1 (2012-02-24)\n--------------------\n\n- update release information.\n  [thet]\n\n\n3.0\n---\n\n- add api for proper timezone support. allow creating ical date-time strings\n  with timezone information from python datetimes with pytz based timezone\n  information and vice versa.\n  [thet]\n\n- unify api to only use to_ical and from_ical and remove string casting as a\n  requirement for python 3 compatibility:\n  new: to_ical.\n  old: ical, string, as_string and string casting via __str__ and str.\n  new: from_ical.\n  old: from_string.\n  [thet]\n\n\n2.2 (2011-08-24)\n----------------\n\n- migration to https://github.com/collective/icalendar using svn2git preserving\n  tags, branches and authors.\n  [garbas]\n\n- using tox for testing on python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.6.\n  [garbas]\n\n- fixed tests so they pass also under python 2.7.\n  [garbas]\n\n- running tests on https://jenkins.plone.org/job/icalendar (only 2.6 for now)\n  with some other metrics (pylint, clonedigger, coverage).\n  [garbas]\n\n- review and merge changes from https://github.com/cozi/icalendar fork.\n  [garbas]\n\n- created sphinx documentation and started documenting development and goals.\n  [garbas]\n\n- hook out github repository to https://readthedocs.org service so sphinx\n  documentation is generated on each commit (for master). documentation can be\n  visible on: https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n  [garbas]\n\n\n2.1 (2009-12-14)\n----------------\n\n- fix deprecation warnings about ``object.__init__`` taking no parameters.\n\n- set the value parameter correctly for date values.\n\n- long binary data would be base64 encoded with newlines, which made the\n  icalendar files incorrect. (this still needs testing).\n\n- correctly handle content lines which include newlines.\n\n\n2.0.1 (2008-07-11)\n------------------\n\n- made the tests run under python 2.5+\n\n- renamed the utc class to utc, so it would not clash with the utc object,\n  since that rendered the utc object unpicklable.\n\n\n2.0 (2008-07-11)\n----------------\n\n- exdate and rdate now returns a vdddlists object, which contains a list\n  of vdddtypes objects. this is do that exdate and rdate can contain\n  lists of dates, as per rfc.\n\n  ***note!***: this change is incompatible with earlier behavior, so if you\n  handle exdate and rdate you will need to update your code.\n\n- when createing a vduration of -5 hours (which in itself is nonsensical),\n  the ical output of that was -p1dt19h, which is correct, but ugly. now\n  it's '-pt5h', which is prettier.\n\n\n1.2 (2006-11-25)\n----------------\n\n- fixed a string index out of range error in the new folding code.\n\n\n1.1 (2006-11-23)\n----------------\n\n- fixed a bug in caselessdicts popitem. (thanks to michael smith\n  <msmith@fluendo.com>)\n\n- the rfc 2445 was a bit unclear on how to handle line folding when it\n  happened to be in the middle of a utf-8 character. this has been clarified\n  in the following discussion:\n  http://lists.osafoundation.org/pipermail/ietf-calsify/2006-august/001126.html\n  and this is now implemented in icalendar. it will not fold in the middle of\n  a utf-8 character, but may fold in the middle of a utf-8 composing character\n  sequence.\n\n\n1.0 (2006-08-03)\n----------------\n\n- make get_inline and set_inline support non ascii codes.\n\n- added support for creating a python egg distribution.\n\n\n0.11 (2005-11-08)\n-----------------\n\n- changed component .from_string to use types_factory instead of hardcoding\n  entries to 'inline'\n\n- changed utc tzinfo to a singleton so the same one is used everywhere\n\n- made the parser more strict by using regular expressions for key name,\n  param name and quoted/unquoted safe char as per the rfc\n\n- added some tests from the schooltool icalendar parser for better coverage\n\n- be more forgiving on the regex for folding lines\n\n- allow for multiple top-level components on .from_string\n\n- fix vweekdays, wasn't accepting relative param (eg: -3sa vs -sa)\n\n- vdddtypes didn't accept negative period (eg: -p30m)\n\n- 'n' is also acceptable as newline on content lines, per rfc\n\n\n0.10 (2005-04-28)\n-----------------\n\n- moved code to codespeak.net subversion.\n\n- reorganized package structure so that source code is under 'src' directory.\n  non-package files remain in distribution root.\n\n- redid doc/.py files as doc/.txt, using more modern doctest. before they\n  were .py files with big docstrings.\n\n- added test.py testrunner, and tests/test_icalendar.py that picks up all\n  doctests in source code and doc directory, and runs them, when typing::\n\n    python2.3 test.py\n\n- renamed icalendar to lower case package name, lowercased, de-pluralized and\n  shorted module names, which are mostly implementation detail.\n\n- changed tests so they generate .ics files in a temp directory, not in the\n  structure itself.\n\nlicense\n=======\n\ncopyright (c) 2012-2013, plone foundation\nall rights reserved.\n\nredistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n - redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n   list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n - redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n   this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n   and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nthis software is provided by the copyright holders and contributors \"as is\" and\nany express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied\nwarranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are\ndisclaimed. in no event shall the copyright holder or contributors be liable\nfor any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential\ndamages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or\nservices; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however\ncaused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability,\nor tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use\nof this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.\n\n\n\n",
