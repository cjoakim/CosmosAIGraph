  "description": "# dash ag grid\n\ndash ag grid is a dash component wrapper for the ag grid javascript package, enabling you to display ag grid components natively in your dash app.\n\nthe underlying ag grid javascript package is a third-party software component developed by [ag grid ltd](http://www.ag-grid.com/). many features are available for free in the ag grid [community version](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid). some features require a paid subscription to the ag grid enterprise version ([more info available here](https://www.ag-grid.com/license-pricing.php)). both the community and enterprise versions are included in this component, but the enterprise features require you to provide a valid ag grid license key. the demos which use enterprise features are clearly marked.\n\n\n## v2.0.0 release\n\nif you have tried v2.0.0 alpha releases, release candidates, or our v1.x enterprise package, please see our [migration guide](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid/migration-guide) (previously hosted [here](https://dashaggrid.pythonanywhere.com/getting-started/migration-guide)).\n\n\n### getting started\n\n`pip install dash-ag-grid`\n\n\n### documentation\nplease see the [dash documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid).\n\n## contributing\n\ndash ag grid welcomes community contributions!\n\nif you have identified a bug or have an idea for a new feature, it's best to start with a github issue. first look at existing issues at https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/issues to make sure this is not a duplicate. then create a new issue. bug reports should be accompanied by a small example app that someone else can copy and run to reproduce the problem.\n\nthe docs are under development as well. there are many examples in the official ag grid docs that have not been included here yet. please open an issue or do pull requests for edits or to add examples. or post your question, comments or demo apps on the [dash community forum](https://community.plotly.com/).\n\n\n### developing in this repo\n\nmake sure you have dash installed with dev and testing extras:\n```\npip install dash[dev,testing]\n```\nbuild the component (from the root of this repo):\n```\nnpm i\nnpm run build\n```\nnow install the component in development mode:\n```\n$ pip install -e .\n```\nin development mode, python uses the files in this directory when you import the package. so you can write a testing app in another folder, and whenever you change some code and rebuild the component here it will update in your testing app.\n\n### create a production build\n\ncreate source and wheel distributions in the generated `dist/` folder, after emptying out any previous builds:\n```\nrm -rf dist build\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\nsee [pypa](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#packaging-your-project)\nfor more information.\nthen use [`twine`](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) to upload these to pypi:\n```\ntwine upload dist/*\n```\nwe also publish the javascript build to npm, so `unpkg` has the bundles if users set `serve_locally=false`. first make a test of the npm package, verify that its contents are reasonable:\n```\nnpm pack\n```\nthen publish:\n```\nnpm publish\n```\n",
