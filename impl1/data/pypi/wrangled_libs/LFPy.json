your model, running your simulations and calculating the extracellular potentials arising from activity in your model neuron. if you have a model working in neuron (www.neuron.yale.edu) already, it is likely that it can be adapted to work with lfpy.\n\nthe extracellular potentials are calculated from transmembrane currents in multicompartment neuron models using the line-source method (holt & koch, j comp neurosci 1999),\nbut a simpler point-source method is also available. the calculations assume that the neuron are surrounded by an infinite extracellular medium with homogeneous and frequency\nindependent conductivity, and compartments are assumed to be at least at a minimal distance from the electrode (which can be specified by the user). for more information on\nthe biophysics underlying the numerical framework used see this coming book chapter:\n\n- k.h. pettersen, h. linden, a.m. dale and g.t. einevoll: extracellular spikes and current-source density, in *handbook of neural activity measurement*, edited by r. brette and a. destexhe, cambridge, to appear (preprint pdf, 5.7mb <http://www.csc.kth.se/~helinden/pettersenlindendaleeinevoll-bookchapter-revised.pdf>\n\nthe first release of lfpy (v1.x) was mainly designed for simulation extracellular potentials of single neurons, described in our paper on the package in frontiers in neuroinformatics entitled \"lfpy: a tool for biophysical simulation of extracellular potentials generated by detailed model neurons\".\nthe article can be found at <https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2013.00041>.\nsince version 2 (lfpy v2.x), the tool also facilitates simulations of extracellular potentials and current dipole moment from ongoing activity in recurrently connected networks of multicompartment neurons, prediction of eeg scalp surface potentials,\nmeg scalp surface magnetic fields, as described in the publication
