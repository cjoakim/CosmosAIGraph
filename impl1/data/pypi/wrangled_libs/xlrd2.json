  "description": "### xlrd2\n\nxlrd2 is an effort to extend [xlrd project](https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd), which is no longer mintained by its developers.\nthe main goal is to make it suitable for extracting necessary information from malicious xls documents.\n\n**xlrd purpose**: provide a library for developers to use to extract data from microsoft excel (tm) spreadsheet files. it is not an end-user tool.\n\n**versions of python supported**: 2.7, 3.4+.\n\n**installation:**\n\n1. installing using pip\n\n        pip install xlrd2\n\n2. installing the latest development\n \n   using pip\n\n        pip install -u https://github.com/dissectmalware/xlrd2/archive/master.zip\n\n   or download the latest version\n   \n        wget https://github.com/dissectmalware/xlrd2/archive/master.zip\n\n   extract the zip file and go to the extracted directory\n   \n        python setup.py install --user\n    \n\n**quick start**:\n\n```python\nimport xlrd2\nbook = xlrd2.open_workbook(\"myfile.xls\")\nprint(\"the number of worksheets is {0}\".format(book.nsheets))\nprint(\"worksheet name(s): {0}\".format(book.sheet_names()))\nsh = book.sheet_by_index(0)\nprint(\"{0} {1} {2}\".format(sh.name, sh.nrows, sh.ncols))\nprint(\"cell d30 is {0}\".format(sh.cell_value(rowx=29, colx=3)))\nfor rx in range(sh.nrows):\n    print(sh.row(rx))\n```\n\n**another quick start**: this will show the first, second and last rows of each sheet in each file:\n\n    python pydir/scripts/runxlrd2.py 3rows *blah*.xls\n\n**xlrd acknowledgements**:\n\n*   this package started life as a translation from c into python of parts of a utility called \"xlreader\" developed by david giffin. \"this product includes software developed by david giffin <david@giffin.org>.\"\n*   openoffice.org has truly excellent documentation of the microsoft excel file formats and compound document file format, authored by daniel rentz. see http://sc.openoffice.org\n*   u+5f20 u+654f: over a decade of inspiration, support, and interesting decoding opportunities.\n*   ksenia marasanova: sample macintosh and non-latin1 files, alpha testing\n*   backporting to python 2.1 was partially funded by journyx - provider of timesheet and project accounting solutions (http://journyx.com/).\n*   provision of formatting information in version 0.6.1 was funded by simplistix ltd (http://www.simplistix.co.uk/)\n\n\n",
