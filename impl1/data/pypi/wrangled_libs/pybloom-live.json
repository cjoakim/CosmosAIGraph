  "description": "\nthis bloom filter is forked from pybloom, and its tightening ratio is changed to 0.9, and this ration is consistently used. choosing r around 0.8 - 0.9 will result in better average space usage for wide range of growth, therefore the default value of model is set to large_set_growth.\nthis is a python implementation of the bloom filter probabilistic data\nstructure. the module also provides a scalable bloom filter that allows a\nbloom filter to grow without knowing the original set size.\n\n\n",
