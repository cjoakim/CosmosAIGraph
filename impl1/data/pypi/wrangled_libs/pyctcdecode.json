either .arpa or .bin file\n    alpha=0.5,  # tuned on a val set\n    beta=1.0,  # tuned on a val set\n)\ntext = decoder.decode(logits)\n```\n\nif the vocabulary is bpe-based, `pyctcdecode` will automatically recognize that and handled token merging automatically.\n\n_(note: the lm itself has no notion of this and is still word-based.)_\n\n``` python\nlabels = [\"<unk>\", \"\u2581bug\", \"s\", \"\u2581bunny\"]\n\ndecoder = build_ctcdecoder(\n    labels,\n    kenlm_model_path,\n)\ntext = decoder.decode(logits)\n```\n\nimprove domain specificity by adding important contextual words (\"hotwords\") during inference:\n\n``` python\nhotwords = [\"looney tunes\", \"anthropomorphic\"]\ntext = decoder.decode(\n    logits,\n    hotwords=hotwords,\n    hotword_weight=10.0,\n)\n```\n\n_(note: `pyctcdecode` contains several free hyperparameters\nthat can strongly influence error rate and wall time.  default values\nfor these parameters were (merely) chosen in order to yield good\nperformance for one particular use case.  for best results, especially\nwhen working with languages other than english, users are encouraged\nto perform a hyperparameter optimization study on their own data.)_\n\nbatch support via multiprocessing:\n\n``` python\nimport multiprocessing\n\nwith multiprocessing.get_context(\"fork\").pool() as pool:\n    text_list = decoder.decode_batch(pool, logits_list)\n```\n\nuse `pyctcdecode` for a pretrained conformer-ctc model:\n\n``` python\nimport nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr\n\nasr_model = nemo_asr.models.encdecctcmodelbpe.from_pretrained(\n  model_name='stt_en_conformer_ctc_small'\n)\nlogits = asr_model.transcribe([\"my_file.wav\"], logprobs=true)[0]\n\ndecoder = build_ctcdecoder(asr_model.decoder.vocabulary)\ndecoder.decode(logits)\n```\n\nthe tutorials folder contains many well documented notebook examples on how to run speech recognition using pretrained models from nvidia's [nemo](https://github.com/nvidia/nemo) and huggingface/facebook's [wav2vec2](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2.html).\n\nfor more details on how to use all of pyctcdecode's features, have a look at our [main tutorial](tutorials/00_basic_usage.ipynb).\n\n### why pyctcdecode?\n\nin scientific computing, there\u2019s often a tension between a language\u2019s performance and its ease of use for prototyping and experimentation. although c++ is the conventional choice for ctc decoders, we decided to try building one in python. this choice allowed us to easily implement experimental features, while keeping runtime competitive through optimizations like caching and beam pruning. we compare the performance of `pyctcdecode` to an industry standard c++ decoder at various beam widths (shown as inline annotations), allowing us to visualize the trade-off of word error rate (y-axis) vs runtime (x-axis). for beam widths of 10 or greater, pyctcdecode yields strictly superior performance, with lower error rates in less time, see code [here](tutorials/03_eval_performance.ipynb).\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"docs/images/performance.png\"></p>\n\nthe use of python allows us to easily implement features like hotword support with only a few lines of code.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"800px\" src=\"docs/images/hotwords.png\"></p>\n\n`pyctcdecode` can return either a single transcript, or the full results of the beam search algorithm. the latter provides the language model state to enable real-time inference as well as word-based logit indices (frames) to enable word-based timing and confidence score calculations natively through the decoding process.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"450px\" src=\"docs/images/beam_output.png\"></p>\n\nadditional features such as bpe vocabulary, as well as examples of `pyctcdecode` as part of a full speech recognition pipeline, can be found in the [tutorials section](tutorials).\n\n### resources:\n\n- [nemo](https://github.com/nvidia/nemo) and [wav2vec2](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2.html)\n- [ctc blog post](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/)\n- [beam search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlwuzllsigw) by andrew ng\n- talks on beam search and pyctcdecode ([longer talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cduvvl0z_xk) and [shorter talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp7fhmtnk9a)) \n\n### license:\n\nlicensed under the apache 2.0 license. unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software distributed under the license is distributed on an \"as is\" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license.\n\ncopyright 2021-present kensho technologies, llc. the present date is determined by the timestamp of the most recent commit in the repository.\n",
