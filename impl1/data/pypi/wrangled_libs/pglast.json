the *parse tree* of a postgresql__ statement (extracted\nby the almost standard pg parser repackaged as a standalone static library by `libpg_query`__)\nas set of interconnected *nodes*, usually called an *abstract syntax tree*.\n\n__ https://www.postgresql.org/\n__ https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query\n\nsee a `more detailed introduction`__ in the documentation_.\n\n__ https://pglast.readthedocs.io/en/v5/introduction.html\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nas usual, the easiest way is with pip::\n\n  $ pip install pglast\n\nalternatively you can clone the repository::\n\n  $ git clone https://github.com/lelit/pglast.git --recursive\n\nand install from there::\n\n  $ pip install ./pglast\n\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n\nthere is a set of *makefiles*

``str``\n\n  using a ``decimal`` implies potential differences in the representation of floating numbers,\n  and already caused issues (`#91`__ and `#100`__) in the past, making it impossible to

https://github.com/lelit/pglast/issues/79\n\n- make it possible to pass also concrete ``ast.node``\\ s to ``rawstream```\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n**breaking changes**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- to reduce confusion, the ``printer`` module has been removed: print-specific stuff is now\n  directly exposed by the ``printers`` subpackage while serialization classes are now in the\n  new ``stream`` module\n\n- the default value for the ``safety_belt`` option of the ``printify()`` function is now\n  ``false``\n\n\n3.0.dev1 (2021-05-16)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- fix ``at_setidentity``, ``at_enablereplicatrig`` and ``altersubscriptionstmt`` printers\n\n- improve ``altertsconfigtype`` and ``intoclause`` printers\n\n- new generic \"visitor pattern\" (`issue #51`__) exemplified by a

implement ``alterextensionstmt`` printer\n\n\n3.0.dev0 (2021-05-03)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- expose the new ``pg_query_scan()`` function as ``parser.scan()``\n\n- expose the ``pg_query_parse()`` function as ``parser.parse_sql_json()``\n\n- expose the new ``pg_query_parse_protobuf()`` function as ``parser.parse_sql_protobuf()``\n\n- expose the new ``pg_query_deparse_protobuf()`` function as ``parser.deparse_protobuf()``\n\n- honor the ``catalogname`` of a ``rangevar`` if present (`issue #71`__)\n\n  __ https://github.com/lelit/pglast/issues/71\n\n- cover almost all ``sql`` statements, testing against the whole ``postgresql`` `regression\n  suite`__ (`issue #68`__, `pr #72`__ and `pr #77`__), thanks to ronan dunklau and hong cheng\n\n  __ https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query/tree/13-latest/test/sql/postgres_regress_\n  __ https://github.com/lelit/pglast/issues/68\n  __ https://github.com/lelit/pglast/pull/72\n  __ https://github.com/lelit/pglast/pull/77\n\n- new rudimentary support for the `preserve comments` feature (`issue #23`__)\n\n  __ https://github.com/lelit/pglast/issues/23\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n**breaking changes**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- target postgresql 13\n\n- the ``pglast.parser`` module exposes all ``libpg_query`` entry points, even the new\n  ``pg_query_deparse_protobuf()`` function that is basically equivalent to\n  ``rawstream``\\ -based printer\n\n- the ``split()`` function is now based on the lower level ``pg_query_split_with_xxx()``\n  functions\n\n- the ``parse_sql()`` function returns native python objects, not a ``json`` string as before:\n  all pg *nodes* are now represented by subclasses of ``pglast.ast.node``, without exception,\n  even ``expr`` and ``value`` are there. the latter impacts on ``pglast.node.scalar``: for\n  example it now may contains a ``ast.integer`` instance instead of a python ``int``\n\n- the ``pgpp --parse-tree`` output is a `pprint`__ represention of the ``ast``, not a ``json``\n  string as before\n\n  __ https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/pprint.html#pprint.pprint\n\n- the ``parseerror`` exception does not expose the ``location`` as an instance member anymore,\n  although its still there, as the second argument (ie ``.args[1]``); furthermore, its value\n  now corresponds to the index in the original unicode string, instead of the offset in the\n  ``utf-8`` representation passed to the underlying c function\n\n\nversion 2\n#########\n\n2.0.dev3 (2021-02-20)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- handle ``include`` clause in ``indexstmt`` (`pr #67`__), thanks to ronan dunklau\n\n  __
