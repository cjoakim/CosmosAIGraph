(if you're working in a virtualenv, these two packages should\nalready be present.)\n\n```shell\npip install pytype\n```\n\nor from the source code [on github][github].\n\n```shell\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/google/pytype.git\ncd pytype\npip install .\n```\n\ninstead of using `--recurse-submodules`, you could also have run\n\n```shell\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n```\n\nin the `pytype` directory. to edit the code and have your edits tracked live,\nreplace the pip install command with:\n\n```shell\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### installing on wsl\n\nfollow the steps above, but make sure you have the correct libraries first:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libpython3-dev\n```\n\n## usage\n\n```\nusage: pytype [options] input [input ...]\n\npositional arguments:\n  input                 file or directory to process\n```\n\ncommon options:\n\n* `-v, --python-version`: python version (major.minor) of the target code.\n  defaults to the version that pytype is running under.\n* `-o, --output`: the directory into which all pytype output goes, including\n  generated .pyi files. defaults to `.pytype`.\n* `-d, --disable`. comma or space-separated list of error names to ignore.\n  detailed explanations of pytype's error names are in\n  [this doc][error-classes]. defaults to empty.\n\nfor a full list of options, run `pytype --help`.\n\nin addition to the above, you can direct pytype to use a custom typeshed\ninstallation instead of its own bundled copy by setting `$typeshed_home`.\n\n### config file\n\nfor convenience, you can save your pytype configuration in a file. the config\nfile can be a toml-style file with a `[tool.pytype]` section (preferred) or an\nini-style file with a `[pytype]` section. if an explicit config file is not\nsupplied, pytype will look for a pytype section in the first `pyproject.toml` or\n`setup.cfg` file found by walking upwards from the current working directory.\n\nstart off by generating a sample config file:\n\n```shell\n$ pytype --generate-config pytype.toml\n```\n\nnow customize the file based on your local setup, keeping only the sections you\nneed. directories may be relative to the location of the config file, which is\nuseful if you want to check in the config file as part of your project.\n\nfor example, suppose you have the following directory structure and want to\nanalyze package `~/repo1/foo`, which depends on package `~/repo2/bar`:\n\n```\n~/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 repo1\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 file_to_check.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 repo2\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 bar\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 dependency.py\n```\n\nhere is the filled-in config file, which instructs pytype to type-check\n`~/repo1/foo` as python 3.9 code, look for packages in `~/repo1` and `~/repo2`,\nand ignore attribute errors. notice that the path to a package does not include\nthe package itself.\n\n```toml\n$ cat ~/repo1/pytype.toml\n\n# note: all relative paths are relative to the location of this file.\n\n[tool.pytype]\n\n# space-separated list of files or directories to process.\ninputs = [\n    'foo',\n]\n\n# python version (major.minor) of the target code.\npython_version = '3.9'\n\n# paths to source code directories, separated by ':'.\npythonpath = .:~/repo2\n\n# space-separated list of error names to ignore.\ndisable = [\n    'attribute-error',\n]\n```\n\nwe could've discovered that `~/repo2` needed to be added to the pythonpath by\nrunning pytype's broken dependency checker:\n\n```\n$ pytype --config=~/repo1/pytype.toml ~/repo1/foo/*.py --unresolved\n\nunresolved dependencies:\n  bar.dependency\n```\n\n### subtools\n\npytype ships with a few scripts in addition to `pytype` itself:\n\n* `annotate-ast`, an in-progress type annotator for asts.\n* [`merge-pyi`][merge-pyi], for merging type information from a .pyi file into a\npython file.\n* `pytd-tool`, a parser for .pyi files.\n* `pytype-single`, a debugging tool for pytype developers, which analyzes a\nsingle python file assuming that .pyi files have already been generated for all\nof its dependencies.\n* `pyxref`, a cross-references generator.\n\n## 2023 roadmap\n\n* typegraph rewrite for improved correctness and performance.\n* basic python 3.11 support.\n\n## license\n[apache 2.0][license]\n\n## disclaimer\nthis is not an official google product.\n\n[error-classes]:
