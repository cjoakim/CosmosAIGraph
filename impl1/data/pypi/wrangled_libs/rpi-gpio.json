  "description": "this package provides a python module to control the gpio on a raspberry pi.\n\nnote that this module is unsuitable for real-time or timing critical applications.  this is because you\ncan not predict when python will be busy garbage collecting.  it also runs under the linux kernel which\nis not suitable for real time applications - it is multitasking o/s and another process may be given\npriority over the cpu, causing jitter in your program.  if you are after true real-time performance and\npredictability, buy yourself an arduino http://www.arduino.cc !\n\nnote that the current release does not support spi, i2c, hardware pwm or serial functionality on the rpi yet.\nthis is planned for the near future - watch this space!  one-wire functionality is also planned.\n\nalthough hardware pwm is not available yet, software pwm is available to use on all channels.\n\nfor examples and documentation, visit http://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/home/\n\nchange log\n==========\n\n0.7.1\n-------\n- better rpi board + peri_addr detection (issue 190 / 191)\n- fix pyeval_initthreads deprecation warning for python 3.9 (issue 188)\n- fix build using gcc 10 (issue 187)\n- fix docstrings to not include licence\n- remove debian/raspbian stretch packaging support\n- use setuptools instead of distutils\n- added detection of zero 2 w\n- tested and working with python 2.7, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10\n\n0.7.0\n-----\n- updated rpi_info to include rpi 4b\n- fixed pull up/down for pi4 (issue 168)\n- fix spelling mistake in docstrings\n- tested and working on raspbian buster + python 3.8.0b2\n- fix board detection for aarch64 (issues 161 / 165)\n- fix checking mmap return value in c_gpio.c (issue 166)\n\n0.6.5\n-----\n- fix exception on re-export of /sys/class/gpio/gpionn\n\n0.6.4\n-----\n- event cleanup bug (issue 145)\n- raise exception for duplicate pwm objects (issue 54 -
