  "description": "stand-alone gnu readline module\n===============================\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/ludwigschwardt/python-gnureadline/build%20and%20test%20package\n   :alt: github workflow status\n   :target: https://github.com/ludwigschwardt/python-gnureadline/actions/workflows/test.yaml\n\nfirst... stop\n-------------\n\nconsider this: do you really need this package in 2022? you typically don't if\n\n- you use the python provided by a standard linux distribution like ubuntu,\n  debian, centos, etc. *(it already uses the proper readline.)*\n- you run **windows**\n  *(it won't work! try* `pyreadline`_ or `prompt_toolkit`_ *instead.)*\n- you use the python provided by **homebrew** or fink on macos\n  *(it has real readline already!)*\n- you want it for `ipython`_\n  *(it switched to* `prompt_toolkit`_ *in version 5.0.)*\n- you use a python distribution like anaconda or enthought / canopy\n  *(again, real readline.)*\n\nyou might need it if\n\n- you use python provided by macports or the system on macos\n  *(python compiled against libedit.)*\n- you use a python distribution like activepython on linux or macos\n  *(this used to ship without readline.)*\n- you want to get the latest bug fixes and features in either the readline\n  library or its python module *(typically when stuck on older systems.)*\n\nstill interested?\n-----------------\n\nsome platforms, such as macos, do not ship with `gnu readline`_ installed.\nthe readline extension module in the standard library of mac \"system\" python\nuses netbsd's `editline`_ (libedit) library instead, which is a readline\nreplacement with a less restrictive software license.\n\nas the alternatives to gnu readline do not have fully equivalent functionality,\nit is useful to add proper readline support to these platforms. this module\nachieves this by bundling the standard python readline module with the gnu\nreadline source code, which is compiled and statically linked to it. the end\nresult is a package which is simple to install and requires no extra shared\nlibraries.\n\nthe module is called *gnureadline* so as not to clash with the readline module\nin the standard library. this keeps polite installers such as `pip`_ happy and\nis sufficient for shells such as `ipython`_. **please take note that ipython\ndoes not depend on gnureadline anymore since version 5.0 as it now uses**\n`prompt_toolkit`_ **instead.**\n\na typical use case is to override readline in your code like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  try:\n      import gnureadline as readline\n  except importerror:\n      import readline\n\nif you want to use this module as a drop-in replacement for readline in the\nstandard python shell, it has to be installed with the less polite easy_install\nscript found in `setuptools`_. **please take note that easy_install has been\ndeprecated for a while and is about to be dropped from setuptools. proceed at\nyour own risk!**\n\nthe module can be used with both python 2.x and 3.x, and has been tested with\npython versions 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2 to 3.10. the first three numbers of the module\nversion reflect the version of the underlying gnu readline library (major,\nminor and patch level), while any additional fourth number distinguishes\ndifferent module updates based on the same readline library.\n\nthis module is usually unnecessary on linux and other unix systems with default\nreadline support. an exception is if you have a python distribution that does\nnot include gnu readline due to licensing restrictions (such as activestate's\nactivepython in the past). if you are using windows, which also ships without\ngnu readline, you might want to consider using the `pyreadline`_ module instead,\nwhich is a readline replacement written in pure python that interacts with the\nwindows clipboard.\n\nthe latest development version is available from the `github repository`_.\n\n.. _gnu readline:
