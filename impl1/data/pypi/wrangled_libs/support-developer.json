  "description": "support developer\n======================\n|pip| |downloads|\n\npackage designed to centralize messages to support developers development work.\n\ni **personally** believe that open source developer should be compensated by the software users when\nthe users have the means. the support should be directly proportional to the amount of time the\nsoftware has spared to the user of the package.\n\nfor this reason, i have created this package that allows developers to show a cleanly designed banner,\nexclusively to users working within **jupyter notebooks** so not to ruin script outputs, and exclusively\nafter they have been using the package for a given number of times.\n\nfurthermore, this banner is only displayed if and only if **the user is importing the package directly**\nin the jupyter notebook, and not as an import from a subpackage, so to avoid potential chains of banners\npopping up.\n\ni hope this solution is a valid and non-obnoxious option for allowing developers to be properly\ncompensated for their hard work, so many times taken for granted. please feel free to\n`open an issue <https://github.com/lucacappelletti94/support_developer/issues>`_ or\n`a pull repository <https://github.com/lucacappelletti94/support_developer/pulls>`_ to discuss and improve this small idea.\n\ninstalling this package\n------------------------------\nas usual, to install this package you can simply use:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    pip install support_developer\n\n\ndocumentation\n------------------------------\nthe code is all documented, but put briefly:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from support_developer import support_message\n\n    support_message(\n        package_name = \"your_package_name\",\n        developer_name = \"your name here\",\n        github_handle = \"yourgithubhandle\",\n        image_url = \"http://www.website.org/image.png\",\n        repository_name = \"repo_name_when_does_not_match_package_name\",\n        # stack trace that should be met to display this object\n        # in a jupyter notebook\n        # usually, this is either `2` or `3`, but it depends\n        # how deep in your code you place this.\n        # i generally just put this in the package init.\n        expected_stack_trace_depth = 2,\n        # after how many imports the user should see this banner.\n        number_of_imports = (5, 100, 1000, 5000)\n    )\n\nthe above code, when properly parametrized for my use case, will show you\nthe following banner. for instance, for the `silence_tensorflow package <https://github.com/lucacappelletti94/silence_tensorflow>`_\na user will see:\n\n|example|\n\n.. |pip| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/support-developer.svg\n    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/support-developer\n    :alt: pypi project\n\n.. |downloads| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/support-developer\n    :target: https://pepy.tech/badge/support-developer\n    :alt: pypi total project downloads\n\n.. |example| image:: https://github.com/lucacappelletti94/support_developer/blob/main/example.png?raw=true\n    :target: https://github.com/lucacappelletti94/support_developer/blob/main/example.png\n    :alt: example",
