  "description": "# file resolver\n\na sceptre resolver to get file contents.  the returned value can be\npassed into a parameter as a string, json, or yaml object.  the\nfile extension determines the return type.  by default, contents from\nany files that do not end in `.json` or `.yaml` will be passed in as\na string.\n\n## motivation\n\nunlike the [file_contents resolver](https://sceptre.cloudreach.com/latest/docs/resolvers.html#file-contents)\nwhich can only pass strings to parameters this resolver can also pass file\ncontent in as json and yaml object.  this resolver can also resolve remote file\ncontents from the web.\n\n## syntax\n\n```yaml\nparameters|sceptre_user_data:\n  <name>: !file /path/to/local/file\n```\n\n```yaml\nparameters|sceptre_user_data:\n  <name>: !file url/to/file\n```\n\n## examples\n\n### local file\n\n#### text\nget file content and pass it to the parameter as a text string:\n\ntags/departments.txt\n```text\n\"hr, governance, engineering, marketing\"\n```\n\n```yaml\nparameters:\n  departments: !file tags/departments.txt\n```\n\n#### json\nget file contents and pass it to the parameter as a json object:\n\ntags/departments.json\n```json\n[\n  \"hr\",\n  \"governance\",\n  \"engineering\",\n  \"marketing\"\n]\n```\n\n```yaml\nparameters:\n  departments: !file tags/departments.json\n```\n\n#### yaml\nget file contents and pass it to the sceptre_user_data as a yaml object:\n\ntags/departments.yaml\n```yaml\n- \"hr\"\n- \"governance\"\n- \"engineering\"\n- \"marketing\"\n```\n\n```yaml\nsceptre_user_data:\n  departments: !file tags/departments.yaml\n```\n\n__note__: will do the same for files with `.yml` extension.\n\n\n### remote file\nworks similarly to local file except this will get file contents from the web.\n\n#### url\nget file contents from a url reference:\n\n```yaml\nsceptre_user_data:\n  departments: !file https://my-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tags/departments.json\n```\n\n\n",
