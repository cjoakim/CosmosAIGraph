``last`` argument (in this case being assigned ``last_used``) is the\n     number of the last successfully checked interval number (as\n     ``valid_totp()`` will skip it and start checking from the next interval\n     number)\n   - ``is_valid`` is being assigned value of ``false`` if ``my_token`` has not\n     been identified as valid otp for given secret (``my_secret``) and checked\n     interval range. if it has been successful, ``is_valid`` is assigned a\n     number of the working interval number (it should be saved into the\n     database and supplied to the function as ``last`` argument next time the\n     password is being checked, so you cannot use the same token again).\n\nlicense\n=======\n\nlicense for this library is available in ``license.rst`` file, in the same\ndirectory. online version is available here_.\n\n.. _here: https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass/blob/master/readme.rst",
