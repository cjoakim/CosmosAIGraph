  "description": "the python client for eapi\n==========================\n\nthe python client for eapi (pyeapi) is a native python library wrapper around\narista eos eapi.  it provides a set of python language bindings for configuring\narista eos nodes.\n\nthe python library can be used to communicate with eos either locally\n(on-box) or remotely (off-box). it uses a standard ini-style configuration file\nto specify one or more nodes and connection profiles.\n\nthe pyeapi library also provides an api layer for building native python\nobjects to interact with the destination nodes. the api layer is a convenient\nimplementation for working with the eos configuration and is extensible for\ndeveloping custom implementations.\n\nthis library is freely provided to the open source community for building\nrobust applications using arista eos. support is provided as best effort\nthrough github issues.",
