  "description": "\n*paste is in maintenance mode and recently moved from bitbucket to github.\npatches are accepted to keep it on life support, but for the most part, please\nconsider using other options.*\n\n**as of release 3.7.0 paste no longer tries to support python 2. if you are\nrequired to continue using python 2 please pin an earlier version of paste.**\n\npaste provides several pieces of \"middleware\" (or filters) that can be nested\nto build web applications.  each piece of middleware uses the wsgi (`pep 333`_)\ninterface, and should be compatible with other middleware based on those\ninterfaces.\n\n.. _pep 333: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/\n\n* `paste project at github (source code, bug tracker)\n  <https://github.com/cdent/paste/>`_\n* `paste on the python cheeseshop (pypi)\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paste>`_\n* `paste on read the docs\n  <https://pythonpaste.readthedocs.io>`_\n\nsee also:\n\n* `webob <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/webob>`_\n\nincludes these features...\n\ntesting\n-------\n\n* a fixture for testing wsgi applications conveniently and in-process,\n  in ``paste.fixture``\n\n* a fixture for testing command-line applications, also in\n  ``paste.fixture``\n\n* check components for wsgi-compliance in ``paste.lint``\n\ndispatching\n-----------\n\n* chain and cascade wsgi applications (returning the first non-error\n  response) in ``paste.cascade``\n\n* dispatch to several wsgi applications based on url prefixes, in\n  ``paste.urlmap``\n\n* allow applications to make subrequests and forward requests\n  internally, in ``paste.recursive``\n\nweb application\n---------------\n\n* run cgi programs as wsgi applications in ``paste.cgiapp``\n\n* traverse files and load wsgi applications from ``.py`` files (or\n  static files), in ``paste.urlparser``\n\n* serve static directories of files, also in ``paste.urlparser``; also\n  in that module serving from egg resources using ``pkg_resources``.\n\ntools\n-----\n\n* catch http-related exceptions (e.g., ``httpnotfound``) and turn them\n  into proper responses in ``paste.httpexceptions``\n\n* several authentication techniques, including http (basic and\n  digest), signed cookies, and cas single-signon, in the\n  ``paste.auth`` package.\n\n* create sessions in ``paste.session`` and ``paste.flup_session``\n\n* gzip responses in ``paste.gzip``\n\n* a wide variety of routines for manipulating wsgi requests and\n  producing responses, in ``paste.request``, ``paste.response`` and\n  ``paste.wsgilib``\n\ndebugging filters\n-----------------\n\n* catch (optionally email) errors with extended tracebacks (using\n  zope/zpt conventions) in ``paste.exceptions``\n\n* catch errors presenting a `cgitb\n  <http://docs.python.org/2/library/cgitb.html>`_-based\n  output, in ``paste.cgitb_catcher``.\n\n* profile each request and append profiling information to the html,\n  in ``paste.debug.profile``\n\n* capture ``print`` output and present it in the browser for\n  debugging, in ``paste.debug.prints``\n\n* validate all html output from applications using the `wdg validator\n  <http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/>`_, appending any errors\n  or warnings to the page, in ``paste.debug.wdg_validator``\n\nother tools\n-----------\n\n* a file monitor to allow restarting the server when files have been\n  updated (for automatic restarting when editing code) in\n  ``paste.reloader``\n\n* a class for generating and traversing urls, and creating associated\n  html code, in ``paste.url``\n\nthe official development repo is at https://github.com/cdent/paste.\n",
