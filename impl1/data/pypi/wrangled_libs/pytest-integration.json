  "description": "pytest-integration\n==================\n\noverview\n--------\nplugin for [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) to mark tests as\nintegration or slow integration.\n\nintegration tests are run after normal tests (unit tests) and\nslow integration tests are run after (quick) integration tests.\n\nif a unit test fails, (quick) integration and slow integration tests are not run.\n\nif a (quick) integration tests fails, slow integration tests are not run.\n\nif you have also installed [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/),\nthen code coverage is disabled for all integration tests, since unit tests\nare supposed to cover all the code.\n\nadded pytest markers\n--------------------------\n- `@pytest.mark.integration_test` marks this test as a (quick) integration test\n- `@pytest.mark.slow_integration_test` marks this test as a slow integration test\n\nadded pytest command line options\n--------------------------\n- `--with-integration` run (quick) integration tests (default)\n- `--with-slow-integration` run slow integration tests (default)\n- `--integration-cover` let integration tests contribute to coverage\n\n`with` options also have a `without` variant.\n\nexample\n-------\nsee the example directory. examples of how to run are in the makefile.\n\ncompatibility\n-------------\n- when running under xdist, each node will pick tests based on an index. that\n  means that nodes that receive only unit tests that pass, will continue to run\n  (slow) integration tests, even if another node receives a unit test that\n  fails.\n\n\n",
