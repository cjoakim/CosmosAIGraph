  "description": "green\n=====\n\ngreen is a clean, colorful, fast python test runner.\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nfor full documentation please visit the `github page for green`_, or subscribe\nto `python testing with green`_ on udemy.  you can find discounts for the udemy\ncourse in the documentation on github.\n\nfeatures\n--------\n\n- **clean** - low redundancy in output. result statistics for each test is vertically aligned.\n- **colorful** - terminal output makes good use of color when the terminal supports it.\n- **fast** - tests run in independent processes.  (one per processor by default.  does not play nicely with gevent.)\n- **powerful** - multi-target + auto-discovery.\n- **traditional** - use the normal ``unittest`` classes and methods for your unit tests.\n- **descriptive** - multiple verbosity levels, from just dots to full docstring output.\n- **convenient** - bash-completion and zsh-completion of options and test targets.\n- **thorough** - built-in integration with `coverage`_\n- **modern** - supports python 3.5+.  additionally, `pypy` is supported on a best-effort basis.\n- **portable** - macos, linux, and bsds are fully supported.  windows is supported on a best-effort basis.\n- **living** - this project grows and changes.  see the `changelog`_\n\n.. _github page for green: https://github.com/cleancut/green#green\n.. _python testing with green: https://www.udemy.com/python-testing-with-green/?couponcode=green_angel\n.. _coverage: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/\n.. _pypy: http://pypy.org\n.. _changelog: https://github.com/cleancut/green/blob/main/changelog.md\n",
