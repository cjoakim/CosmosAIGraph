  "description": "bech32\n======\n\nsince this implementation wasn't in a place that was easy to use for python programmers i took it from from https://github.com/rustyrussell/lightning-payencode and published [on github](https://github.com/fiatjaf/bech32) and [on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/bech32/).\n\nthe original version of this package is probably the one at https://github.com/sipa/bech32/tree/master/ref/python, but apparently rusty russel commented out the 90-length limit of bech32-encoded stuff so it could be used for lightning invoices. let's keep that change.\n\ninstall\n-------\n\n```\npip install bech32\n```\n\n\n",
