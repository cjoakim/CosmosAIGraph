  "description": "===============================\n lit - a software testing tool\n===============================\n\nabout\n=====\n\n*lit* is a portable tool for executing llvm and clang style test suites,\nsummarizing their results, and providing indication of failures. *lit* is\ndesigned to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a user interface as\npossible.\n\n\nfeatures\n========\n\n * portable!\n * flexible test discovery.\n * parallel test execution.\n * support for multiple test formats and test suite designs.\n\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\nthe official *lit* documentation is in the man page, available online at the llvm\ncommand guide: http://llvm.org/cmds/lit.html.\n\n\nsource\n======\n\nthe *lit* source is available as part of llvm, in the llvm source repository:\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/utils/lit\n\n\ncontributing to lit\n===================\n\nplease browse the issues labeled *tools:llvm-lit* in llvm's issue tracker for\nideas on what to work on:\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/labels/tools%3allvm-lit\n\nbefore submitting patches, run the test suite to ensure nothing has regressed::\n\n    # from within your llvm source directory.\n    utils/lit/lit.py \\\n        --path /path/to/your/llvm/build/bin \\\n        utils/lit/tests\n\nnote that lit's tests depend on ``not`` and ``filecheck``, llvm utilities.\nyou will need to have built llvm tools in order to run lit's test suite\nsuccessfully.\n\nyou'll also want to confirm that lit continues to work when testing llvm.\nfollow the instructions in http://llvm.org/docs/testingguide.html to run the\nregression test suite:\n\n    make check-llvm\n\nand be sure to run the llvm-lit wrapper script as well:\n\n    /path/to/your/llvm/build/bin/llvm-lit utils/lit/tests\n\nfinally, make sure lit works when installed via setuptools:\n\n    python utils/lit/setup.py install\n    lit --path /path/to/your/llvm/build/bin utils/lit/tests\n\n\n\n",
