  "description": "# cmsis-pack-manager\ncmsis-pack-manager is a python module, rust crate and command line utility for managing current device information that is stored in many cmsis packs. users of cmsis-pack-manager may query for information such as processor type, flash algorithm and memory layout information in a python program or through the command line utility, `pack-manager`, provided as part of this module.\n\n# ci status\n[![windows build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/tltovxvu20y4pma8?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/theotherjimmy/cmsis-pack-manager) [![mac and linux build status](https://travis-ci.org/armmbed/cmsis-pack-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/armmbed/cmsis-pack-manager)\n\n## wheels\n\nthe last step of ci uploads binary wheels to [this s3 bucket.](http://mbed-os.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/?prefix=builds/cmsis-pack-manager/dist/)\n\n# docs!\n\nthey live here: https://pyocd.github.io/cmsis-pack-manager/\n\n# building\n\nto build cmsis-pack-manager locally, install a stable rust compiler.\nsee https://rustup.rs/ for details on installing `rustup`, the rust\ntoolchain updater. afterwards, run `rustup update stable` to get the\nmost recent stable rust toolchain and build system.\n\nafter installing the rust toolchain and downloading a stable compiler,\nrun `python2 setup.py bdist_wheel` from the root of this repo to\ngenerate a binary wheel (`.whl` file) in the same way as we release.\n\nfor testing purposes, there is a cli written in rust within the rust\nworkspace as the package `cmsis-cli`. for example from the `rust`\ndirectory, `cargo run -p cmsis-cli -- update` builds this testing\ncli and runs the update command, for example.\n\n",
