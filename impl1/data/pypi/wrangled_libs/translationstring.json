  "description": "translationstring\n=================\n\na library used by various `pylons project <https://pylonsproject.org>`_ packages\nfor internationalization (i18n) duties related to translation.\n\nthis package provides a *translation string* class, a *translation string\nfactory* class, translation and pluralization primitives, and a utility that\nhelps `chameleon <https://chameleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ templates use\ntranslation facilities of this package.  it does not depend on `babel\n<http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/>`_, but its translation and pluralization\nservices are meant to work best when provided with an instance of the\n``babel.support.translations`` class.\n\nplease see https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/translationstring/en/latest/\nfor the documentation.\n\n\ntranslationstring\n=================\n\n1.4 (2020-07-09)\n----------------\n\n- drop support for python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.\n- update license classifiers\n\n\n1.3 (2014-11-05)\n----------------\n\n- fix python 3-specific test failures.\n\n- restore compatibility with python 3.2.\n\n1.2 (2014-11-04)\n----------------\n\n- add support for message contexts.\n\n- if the object passed to a translationstringfactory ``__call__`` method is\n  itself a translation string, use the passed object's ``domain`` instead of\n  the domain passed to the factory's contstructor.  see\n  https://github.com/pylons/translationstring/pull/12 .\n\n\n1.1 (2012-02-08)\n----------------\n\n- add manifest to make sure all files are present in a release. this fixes\n  `ticket 8 <https://github.com/pylons/translationstring/issues/8>`_.\n\n\n1.0 (2012-02-04)\n----------------\n\n- coerce non-string values to a string during translation, except for none.\n\n- honour mapping information passed to the translator, combining it with\n  mapping data already part of the translation string.\n\n- support formatting of translation strings with %-operator.\n\n0.4 (09-22-2011)\n----------------\n\n- python 3 compatibility (thanks to joe dallago, gsoc student).\n\n- remove testing dependency on babel.\n\n- moved to github (https://github.com/pylons/translationstring).\n\n- added tox.ini for testing purposes.\n\n0.3 (06-25-2010)\n----------------\n\n- preserve default translations even if they are an empty string. this\n  fixes problems with chameleon being unable to determine if a translation\n  is present or not.\n\n0.2 (04-25-2010)\n----------------\n\n- add ``__getstate__`` and ``__reduce__`` methods to translation\n  string to allow for pickling.\n\n- fix bug in chameleontranslate.  when ``i18n:translate`` was used in\n  templates, a translation string was inappropriately created with a\n  ``default`` value of the empty string.  symptom: template text would\n  \"disappear\" rather than being returned untranslated.\n\n0.1 (04-24-2010)\n----------------\n\n- initial release.\n\n\n",
