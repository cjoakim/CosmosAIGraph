it is just an initial value. please follow instructions below.\n   ```\n\n2. the api model in msal provides you explicit control on how to utilize token cache.\n   this cache part is technically optional, but we highly recommend you to harness the power of msal cache.\n   it will automatically handle the token refresh for you.\n\n   ```python\n   # we now check the cache to see\n   # whether we already have some accounts that the end user already used to sign in before.\n   accounts = app.get_accounts()\n   if accounts:\n       # if so, you could then somehow display these accounts and let end user choose\n       print(\"pick the account you want to use to proceed:\")\n       for a in accounts:\n           print(a[\"username\"])\n       # assuming the end user chose this one\n       chosen = accounts[0]\n       # now let's try to find a token in cache for this account\n       result = app.acquire_token_silent([\"your_scope\"], account=chosen)\n   ```\n\n3. either there is no suitable token in the cache, or you chose to skip the previous step,\n   now it is time to actually send a request to aad to obtain a token.\n   there are different methods based on your client type and scenario. here we demonstrate a placeholder flow.\n\n   ```python\n   if not result:\n       # so no suitable token exists in cache. let's get a new one from aad.\n       result = app.acquire_token_by_one_of_the_actual_method(..., scopes=[\"user.read\"])\n   if \"access_token\" in result:\n       print(result[\"access_token\"])  # yay!\n   else:\n       print(result.get(\"error\"))\n       print(result.get(\"error_description\"))\n       print(result.get(\"correlation_id\"))  # you may need this when reporting a bug\n   ```\n\nrefer the [wiki](https://github.com/azuread/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/wiki) pages for more details on the msal python functionality and usage.\n\n## migrating from adal\n\nif your application is using adal python, we recommend you to update to use msal python. no new feature work will be done in adal python.\n\nsee the [adal to msal migration](https://github.com/azuread/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/wiki/migrate-to-msal-python) guide.\n\n## roadmap\n\nyou can follow the latest updates and plans for msal python in the [roadmap](https://github.com/azuread/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/wiki/roadmap) published on our wiki.\n\n## samples and documentation\n\nmsal python supports multiple [application types and authentication scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-flows-app-scenarios).\nthe generic documents on\n[auth scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)\nand\n[auth protocols](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols)\nare recommended reading.\n\nwe provide a [full suite of sample applications](https://aka.ms/aaddevsamplesv2) and [documentation](https://aka.ms/aaddevv2) to help you get started with learning the microsoft identity platform.\n\n## community help and support\n\nwe leverage stack overflow to work with the community on supporting azure active directory and its sdks, including this one!\nwe highly recommend you ask your questions on stack overflow (we're all on there!)\nalso browser existing issues to see if someone has had your question before.\n\nwe recommend you use the \"msal\" tag so we can see it!\nhere is the latest q&a on stack overflow for msal:\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/msal](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/msal)\n\n## submit feedback\nwe'd like your thoughts on this library. please complete [this short survey.](https://forms.office.com/r/tmjzkdbzjy)\n\n## security reporting\n\nif you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [microsoft bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. please do not post security issues to github issues or any other public site. we will contact you shortly upon receiving the information. we encourage you to get notifications of when security incidents occur by visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/dd252948) and subscribing to security advisory alerts.\n\n## contributing\n\nall code is licensed under the mit license and we triage actively on github. we enthusiastically welcome contributions and feedback. please read the [contributing guide](./contributing.md) before starting.\n\n## we value and adhere to the microsoft open source code of conduct\n\nthis project has adopted the [microsoft open source code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). for more information see the [code of conduct faq](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n",
