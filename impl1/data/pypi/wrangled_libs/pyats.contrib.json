  "description": "# pyats contribution package\n\nthe `pyats.contrib` package is a collection of open-source extensions for the\npyats framework. \n\nplugins, extensions and codes under this project are designed to automatically\nintegrate into the pyats framework using its various published hook/entry-point\ninterfaces.\n\n## general information\n\n- website: https://developer.cisco.com/pyats/\n- documentation: https://developer.cisco.com/docs/pyats/\n- support: pyats-support-ext@cisco.com\n\n## installation\n\nthis package is automatically installed when you perform a full pyats \ninstallation. alternatively, you can install this package separately, if you \nhave a more light-weight pyats install:\n\n```\n# when using full-install, this package is included by default\n$ pip install pyats[full]\n\n\n# to install separately\n$ pip install pyats.contrib\n```\n\n## solution documentation\n\nfor now, each individual folder under `src/` has its own readme.md file.\nwe are working on a better hosting solution for all documentation related to \nthis repository.\n\n## contributions\n\neveryone is welcomed to pitch-in, collaborate, contribute and improve upon \nwhat's here, and or introduce new ideas and plugins. the goal of this package is\nthree-fold:\n\n    - to introduce a place where the pyats development team can open-source\n      bits and pieces of the framework\n\n    - to provide a location for community members to collaborate together, \n      centrally\n\n    - to document and demonstrate, via examples, the various plugins and hook \n      capabilities the framework has to offer.\n\nplease consider the following when contributing to this repository:\n\n- minimize dependencies as much as possible; use lazy-loading where possible.\n  eg: adding a pip installation dependency will impact all users that install\n  this package, where as adding an import dependency, with try/except around it,\n  and printing a nice error message indicating you need package x installed to\n  enable this feature, allows selectively installation of dependencies per \n  what's needed\n\n- include unit-tests and documentation for everything you develop\n",
