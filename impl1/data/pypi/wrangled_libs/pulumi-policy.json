  "description": "![build status](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-policy/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg)\n\n# pulumi policy sdk\n\n## overview\n\ndefine and manage policy for cloud resources deployed through pulumi.\n\npolicy rules run during `pulumi preview` and `pulumi up`, asserting that cloud resource definitions\ncomply with the policy immediately before they are created or updated. policies may optionally define\nremediations that automatically fix policy violations rather than issue warnings.\n\nduring `preview`, every rule is run on every resource, and policy violations are batched up\ninto a final report. during the update, the first policy violation will halt the deployment.\n\npolicy violations can have enforcement levels that are **advisory**, which results in a printed\nwarning, or **mandatory**, which results in an error after `pulumi preview` or `pulumi up` completes.\nthe enforcement level **remediate** is stronger than both and enables automatic remediations.\n\n## getting started\n\nplease see [get started with policy as code](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/crossguard/) to get\nstarted authoring and enforcing policies.\n\n## documentation\n\nfor additional documentation, guides, best practices, and faqs, see [policy as code](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/crossguard/).\n\n## examples\n\nlooking for examples? please refer to the [examples repo](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/policy-packs).\n\n## languages\n\npolicies can be written in typescript/javascript (node.js) or python and can be applied to pulumi stacks written in any language.\n\n|    | language | status |\n| -- | -------- | ------ |\n| <img src=\"https://www.pulumi.com/logos/tech/logo-ts.png\" height=38 />     | [typescript](./sdk/nodejs) | stable      |\n| <img src=\"https://www.pulumi.com/logos/tech/logo-js.png\" height=38 />     | [javascript](./sdk/nodejs) | stable      |\n| <img src=\"https://www.pulumi.com/logos/tech/logo-python.png\" height=38 /> | [python](./sdk/python)     | preview     |\n| <img src=\"https://www.pulumi.com/logos/tech/dotnet.png\" height=38 />      | .net                       | coming soon |\n| <img src=\"https://www.pulumi.com/logos/tech/logo-golang.png\" height=38 /> | go                         | coming soon |\n",
