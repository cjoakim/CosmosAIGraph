report experiments progress / failure directly to slack (fully customizable!)  \n\n## why clearml?\n\nclearml is our solution to a problem we share with countless other researchers and developers in the machine\nlearning/deep learning universe: training production-grade deep learning models is a glorious but messy process.\nclearml tracks and controls the process by associating code version control, research projects,\nperformance metrics, and model provenance.\n\nwe designed clearml specifically to require effortless integration so that teams can preserve their existing methods\nand practices. \n\n  - use it on a daily basis to boost collaboration and visibility in your team \n  - create a remote job from any experiment with a click of a button\n  - automate processes and create pipelines to collect your experimentation logs, outputs, and data\n  - store all your data on any object-storage solution, with the most straightforward interface possible\n  - make your data transparent by cataloging it all on the clearml platform\n\nwe believe clearml is ground-breaking. we wish to establish new standards of true seamless integration between\nexperiment management, mlops, and data management.\n\n## who we are\n\nclearml is supported by you and the [clear.ml](https://clear.ml) team, which helps enterprise companies build scalable mlops. \n\nwe built clearml to track and control the glorious but messy process of training production-grade deep learning models.\nwe are committed to vigorously supporting and expanding the capabilities of clearml.\n\nwe promise to always be backwardly compatible, making sure all your logs, data, and pipelines will always upgrade with you.\n\n## license\n\napache license, version 2.0 (see the [license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/license-2.0.html) for more information)\n\nif clearml is part of your development process / project / publication, please cite us :heart: : \n```\n@misc{clearml,\ntitle = {clearml -
