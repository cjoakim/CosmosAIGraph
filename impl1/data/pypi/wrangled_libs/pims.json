  "description": "pims: python image sequence\n=========================\n\nwhat problem does pims solve?\n-----------------------------\n\nscientific video can be packaged in various ways: familiar video formats like\n.avi and .mov, folders full of numbered images, or \"stacks\" of tiff images. each\nof these requires a separate python module. and, once loaded, they have\ndifferent methods for **accessing individual images, looping through the images\nin bulk, accessing a specific range, or dealing with multidimensional files**.\npims can do all of these using a consistent interface, handling the differences\nbetween different inputs invisibly.\n\nformats readable by pims include:\n* directories or zipfiles of still images (most formats, including tiff, jpeg, png, bmp), and tiff stacks\n* microscope images supported by the [bio-formats project](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5.1/supported-formats.html), including leica, nikon, olympus, and zeiss formats. requires separate installation; see below.\n* movie formats and codecs supported by ffmpeg, including avi, quicktime mov, and h.264 (mp4). may require separate installation; see below.\n* cine files from vision research cameras\n* seq files from norpix streampix software\n\npims is based on readers by:\n* [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/)\n* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [pyav](http://mikeboers.github.io/pyav/) (video formats such as avi, mov)\n* [jpype](http://jpype.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (interface with bio-formats)\n* [pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (improved tiff support)\n* [libtiff](https://code.google.com/p/pylibtiff/) (alternative tiff support)\n* [tifffile](https://pypi.org/project/tifffile/) (alterative tiff support)\n* [pims_nd2](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims_nd2) (improved nikon .nd2 support)\n* [imageio](https://imageio.github.io) (a multi-purpose reader package that\n   reads and writes many formats)\n* [moviepy](http://zulko.github.io/moviepy) (a python module that supports\n   video editing)\n* [nd2reader](https://github.com/rbnvrw/nd2reader) (a pure python module for reading nikon nis elements nd2 images and metadata)\n\nexamples & documentation\n------------------------\n\neverything is demonstrated in [this ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/soft-matter/pims/blob/master/examples/loading%20video%20frames.ipynb).\n\n[**read the documentation**](http://soft-matter.github.io/pims/) for\ninstallation instructions, examples, and further reference.\n\ncore contributors\n-----------------\n\n  * **daniel allan** founding contributor, slicing and iteration logic,\n    basic readers, display tools\n  * **thomas caswell** major refactor, abstract base class\n  * **casper van der wel** bioformats readers, display tools\n  * **thomas dimiduk** filetype-detecting dispatch logic\n\nsupport\n-------\n\nthis package was developed in part by daniel allan, as part of his\nphd thesis work on microrheology in robert l. leheny's group at johns hopkins\nuniversity in baltimore, md. the work was supported by the national science foundation\nunder grant number cbet-1033985. later work was supported by brookhaven\nnational lab. dan can be reached at dallan@bnl.gov.\n\nthis package was developed in part by thomas a caswell as part of his\nphd thesis work in sidney r nagel's and margaret l gardel's groups at\nthe university of chicago, chicago il.  this work was supported in\npart by nsf grant dmr-1105145 and nsf-mrsec dmr-0820054. later work was\nsupported by brookhaven national lab. tom can be\nreached at tcaswell@gmail.com.\n\nthis package was developed in part by casper van der wel, as part of his\nphd thesis work in daniela kraft's group at the huygens-kamerlingh-onnes laboratory,\ninstitute of physics, leiden university, the netherlands. this work was\nsupported by the netherlands organisation for scientific research (nwo/ocw).\n\n\n",
