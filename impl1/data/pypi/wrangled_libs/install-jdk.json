windows\n  - linux\n  - macos\n  - aix\n\n- architecture\n  - arm\n  - aarch64\n  - ppc64\n  - x64\n  - x86\n\n## installation\n\nto install the install-jdk library, simply run the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install install-jdk\n```\n\n## usage\n\nto use the `install-jdk` library, import it into your python code:\n\n```python\nimport jdk\n```\n\nthe library provides an `install` function, which takes the following parameters:\n\n- `version` - the major version of the java openjdk build to install (e.g. 8, 11, 17, etc.).\n- `operating_system` - the target operating system. if not specified, will use the user's detected operating system if possible.\n- `arch` - the target architecure. if not specified, will use the user's detected architecture if possible.\n- `impl` - the java implementation to use. currently only supports `hotspot` and dependent on the openjdk build vendor.\n- `jre` - a boolean value indicating that the java runtime environment should be installed. defaults to false, which will install the java development kit.\n- `path` - the location to install the downloaded openjdk build. if not specified, will install into `$home/.jdk/<version>` for the java development kit and `$home/.jre/<version>` for the java runtime environment.\n- `vendor` - the vendor to download the openjdk build from. if not specified, defaults to [adoptium](https://adoptium.com). this is a named argument so must be provided like `vendor='corretto'`. please see the list of [supported openjdk build vendors](#supported-openjdk-build-vendors)\n\nhere are some example code snippet:\n\n```python\njdk.install('11')\n# platform dependent install of java jdk 11 into $home/.jdk/<version>\n\njdk.install('11', jre=true)\n# platform dependent install of java jre 11 into $home/.jre/<version>\n\njdk.install('17', vendor='corretto')\n# installs a corretto build of java 17 jdk. defualt vendor is adoptium\n\njdk.install('17', vendor='corretto', path='/usr/local/jdk')\n# installs a corretto build of java 17 jdk into /usr/local/jdk\n```\n\nthe library also has a `get_download_url` function that returns the url for the given version, it takes the following parameters:\n\n- `version` - the major version of the java openjdk build to install (e.g. 8, 11, 17, etc.).\n- `operating_system` - the target operating system. if not specified, will use the user's detected operating system if possible.\n- `arch` - the target architecure. if not specified, will use the user's detected architecture if possible.\n- `impl` - the java implementation to use. currently only supports `hotspot` and dependent on the openjdk build vendor.\n- `jre` - a boolean value indicating that the java runtime environment should be installed. defaults to false, which will install the java development kit.\n- `vendor` - the vendor to download the openjdk build from. if not specified, defaults to [adoptium](https://adoptium.com). this is a named argument so must be provided like `vendor='corretto'`. please see the list of [supported openjdk build vendors](#supported-openjdk-build-vendors)\n\nhere are some example code snippets:\n\n```python\nfrom jdk.enums import operatingsystem, architecture\n\ndownload_url = jdk.get_download_url('17', jre=true)\nprint(download_url)\n# obtains the platform dependent jre download url\n\ndownload_url = jdk.get_download_url('17', operating_system=operatingsystem.linux, arch=architecure.aarch64, vendor='corretto')\nprint(download_url)\n# obtains openjdk 17 from corretto for linux running on aarch64\n```\n\nthe library has a `download` function that will download the requested version and returns back the path to where it was downloaded. this function does not currently support overriding the default download path which is the operating systems specific tmp directory. it takes the following parameters.\n\n- `download_url` - the url to the file to be downloaded. defaults to none.\n  - - `version` - required when `download_version` is none and must be provided as a named parameter. the major version of the java openjdk build to install (e.g. 8, 11, 17, etc.).\n- `operating_system` - must be provided as a named parameter. the target operating system. if not specified, will use the user's detected operating system if possible.\n- `arch` - must be provided as a named parameter. the target architecure. if not specified, will use the user's detected architecture if possible.\n- `impl` - must be provided as a named parameter. the java implementation to use. currently only supports `hotspot` and dependent on the openjdk build vendor.\n- `jre` - must be provided as a named parameter. a boolean value indicating that the java runtime environment should be installed. defaults to false, which will install the java development kit.\n- `vendor` -
