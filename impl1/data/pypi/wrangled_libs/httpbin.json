  "description": "# httpbin(1): http request & response service\n\nthis is a fork of the original httpbin project, which is located at https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin\n\nwhy fork?  we were unable to get ahold of the folks at postmanlabs to maintain the original project, and httpbin is used for other packages within the python ecosystem, such as [pytest-httpbin](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-httpbin/) which is in turn used by packages such as [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requirements-dev.txt#l4) so we have forked this package.  that means that httpbin.org is not actually backed by this repo, but the [httpbin package](https://pypi.org/project/httpbin/) is.  confusing right?  know anyone at postmanlabs?  [get in touch](mailto:me@kevinmccarthy.org).\n\nhttpbin is a [kenneth reitz](http://kennethreitz.org/) project.\n![ice cream](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/572/32514669683_4daf2ab7bc_k_d.jpg)\n\n## downloading and running\n\n```sh\ndocker pull ghcr.io/psf/httpbin\ndocker run -p 80:8080 ghcr.io/psf/httpbin\n```\n\n## using `httpbin` as a library\n\n`httpbin` can be used as a dependency in your own projects by simply adding\n`httpbin` as a dependency.\n\n## manually building the latest docker image\n\nto build the docker image yourself, download the latest `dockerfile` and\n`requirements.txt` files from the [release page][release-page]. store both file\nin the same folder and run:\n\n```sh\ndocker build --build-arg app_version=<your-version> [other docker args] .\n```\n\nalternatively, you can re-generate a new `requirements.txt` file using\n[pip-compile][pip-compile]. in that case, be aware that the code has not been\ntested against those dependencies and we cannot guarantee that such an image\nwill run without errors.\n\nwhere `app_version` will be stored in a docker-label. the default value is an\nempty-string.\n\n[release-page]: https://github.com/psf/httpbin/releases\n[pip-compile]: https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n## maintenance\n\n### \"extra\" dependencies\n\nthe project provides two \"extras\" which contain dependencies that should only\nbe installed for specific use-cases. they will not be included when using\n`httpbin` as a dependency, unless they are *explicitly* requested like\n`httpbin[mainapp]`.\n\n* `mainapp`: includes everything needed to run `httpbin` as a standalone app.\n  this is used by the docker image.\n* `test`: includes additional dependencies for unit-testing. this is only used\n  during development.\n\n### publishing a new release\n\nreleases (both docker and pypi) are automated via github actions (see #17).\n\nfor *pypi* releases, the project uses [trusted-publishing][tp] via [the official\ngithub action][pypi-action].\n\nfor releases on *docker-hub* (when enabled in the ci), the following two\nsecrets are required:\n\n* `dockerhub_username`\n* `dockerhub_token`\n\nreleases are triggered on commits tagged with `release-` (for example\n`release-0.10.0`).\n\n[tp]: https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/\n[pypi-action]: https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish\n\n\n## changelog\n* 0.10.1:\n  - substantial housekeeping, dependency cleanup, image building, and packaging revamp, thanks to @exhuma and @mgorny\n* 0.10.0:\n  - override docker image port with httpbin_port\n  - a number of fixes for code rot, thanks @mgorny and @tjni\n* 0.9.2: ??? (never published as a package; seems to be internal to postman)\n* 0.7.0: ???\n* 0.6.2: ???\n* 0.6.0: ???\n* 0.5.0\n  - allow /redirect-to to work with multiple methods\n  - allow md5 or sha-256 to be chosen as algorithms for http digest auth\n  - set a 10mb limit on /drip\n* 0.4.1: added floating-point support for /delay endpoint\n* 0.4.0: new /image/svg endpoint, add deploy to heroku button, add 406 response to /image, and don\u2019t always emit the transfer-encoding header for stream endpoint.\n* 0.3.0 a number of new features, including a /range endpoint, lots of bugfixes, and a /encoding/utf8 endpoint\n* 0.2.0: added an xml endpoint.  also fixes several bugs with unicode, cors headers, digest auth, and more.\n* 0.1.2: fix a couple python3 bugs with the random byte endpoints, fix a bug when uploading files without a content-type header set.\n* 0.1.1: added templates as data in setup.py\n* 0.1.0: added python3 support and (re)publish on pypi\n\n## officially deployed (but out of date) at:\n\n- http://httpbin.org\n- https://httpbin.org\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/kennethreitz/httpbin/\n\n\n## see also\n\n- http://requestb.in\n- http://python-requests.org\n- https://grpcb.in/\n- [go-httpbin](https://github.com/ahmetb/go-httpbin)\n- [java-httpbin](https://github.com/gaul/java-httpbin)\n\n",
