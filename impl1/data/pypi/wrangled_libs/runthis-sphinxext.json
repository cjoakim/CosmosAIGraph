  "description": "# runthis-sphinxext\nthis provides a sphinx extension that adds runthis code blocks,\nwhich display a highligthed code-block statically, but with a\n\"runthis\" button above them. when the button is clicked, the code\nblock is replaced by a terminal session that has executed that\ncode.\n\n## installation\nrunthis sphinx extention may be installed with either conda or pip:\n\n```sh\n# use the conda-forge channel\n$ conda install -c conda-forge runthis-sphinxext\n\n# or you can use pip, if you must.\n$ pip install runthis-sphinxext\n```\n\n## configuration\nto use the runthis code blocks, you must configure sphinx to know about\nrunthis. first, make sure the sphinx extension is registered. in the\n`conf.py`, add `runthis.sphinxext` somewhere in the extensions block:\n\n```python\nextensions = [\n    ...\n    \"runthis.sphinxext\",\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nafter this, you also need to tell sphinx where the runthis server is\nlocated.  this can be set with the `runthis_server` variable anywhere\nin the `conf.py`.  for example:\n\n```python\n# runthis options\nrunthis_server = \"http://localhost:5000\"\n```\n\n## usage\nto use the runthis directive is very similar to the `code-block`\ndirective in rst. in any of your `*.rst` files, you may use\nthe `runthis` directive, followed by the language name on the\nsame line.  after any `code-block` options and one or more blank lines,\nthe code that you wish to display and run, is in an indented block.\nfor example:\n\n```rst\n.. runthis:: python\n\n    import sys\n    print(sys.executable)\n```\n\nthis will be run on the remote server specified in the `conf.py` file.",
