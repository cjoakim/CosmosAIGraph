  "description": "superlance readme\n=================\n\nsuperlance is a package of plugin utilities for monitoring and controlling\nprocesses that run under `supervisor <http://supervisord.org>`_.\n\nplease see ``docs/index.rst`` for complete documentation.\n\n\n2.0.0 (2021-12-26)\n------------------\n\n- support for python 2.6 has been dropped.  on python 2, superlance\n  now requires python 2.7.\n\n- support for python 3.2 and 3.3 has been dropped.  on python 3, superlance\n  now requires python 3.4 or later.\n\n- fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 where if the timeout value is shorter\n  than the time to wait between retries, the httpok check never executed.\n  issue #110.\n\n- fixed a bug where ``crashmailbatch`` and ``fatalmatchbatch`` did not set\n  the intended default subject.  patch by joe portela.\n\n- added a new ``--tls`` option to ``crashmailbatch``, ``fatalmailbath``, and\n  ``crashsms`` to use transport layer security (tls).  patch by zhe li.\n\n1.0.0 (2016-10-02)\n------------------\n\n- support for python 2.5 has been dropped.  on python 2, superlance\n  now requires python 2.6 or later.\n\n- support for python 3 has been added.  on python 3, superlance\n  requires python 3.2 or later.\n\n- fixed parsing of ``-n`` and ``--name`` options in ``httpok``.  patch\n  by denisby.\n\n0.14 (2016-09-24)\n-----------------\n\n- fixed docs build.\n\n0.13 (2016-09-05)\n-----------------\n\n- ``httpok`` now allows multiple expected status codes to be specified.  patch\n  by valmire.\n\n- ``httpok`` now has a ``--name`` option like

checks even on trying the connection.\n  without it, processes that take make than 60 seconds to accept connections\n  and http_ok with tick_60 events cause a permanent restart of the process.\n\n- ``httpok`` now sends a ``user-agent`` header of ``httpok``.\n\n- removed ``setuptools`` from the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` because\n  it caused installation issues on some systems.\n\n0.9
