devkit for nuscenes and nuimages.\nthe devkit is tested for python 3.6 and python 3.7.\nto install python, please check [here](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/docs/installation.md#install-python).\n\nour devkit is available and can be installed via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) :\n```\npip install nuscenes-devkit\n```\nfor an advanced installation, see [installation](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/docs/installation.md) for detailed instructions.\n\n## nuimages\nnuimages is a stand-alone large-scale image dataset.\nit uses the same sensor setup as the 3d nuscenes dataset.\nthe structure is similar to nuscenes and both use the same devkit, which make the installation process simple.\n\n### nuimages setup\nto download nuimages you need to go to the [download page](https://www.nuscenes.org/download), \ncreate an account and agree to the nuscenes [terms of use](https://www.nuscenes.org/terms-of-use).\nfor the devkit to work you will need to download *at least the metadata and samples*, the *sweeps* are optional.\nplease unpack the archives to the `/data/sets/nuimages` folder \\*without\\* overwriting folders that occur in multiple archives.\neventually you should have the following folder structure:\n```\n/data/sets/nuimages\n    samples\t-\tsensor data for keyframes (annotated images).\n    sweeps  -   sensor data for intermediate frames (unannotated images).\n    v1.0-*\t-\tjson tables that include all the meta data and annotations. each split (train, val, test, mini) is provided in a separate folder.\n```\nif you want to use another folder, specify the `dataroot` parameter of the nuimages class (see tutorial).\n\n### getting started with nuimages\n\nplease follow these steps to make

information, see the [map versions](#map-versions) below.\n\n### map versions\nhere we give a brief overview of the different map versions:\n- **v1.3**: add bitmap class that supports new lidar basemap and legacy semantic prior map. remove [one broken lane](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/issues/493).\n- **v1.2**: expand devkit and maps to include arcline paths and lane connectivity for the prediction challenge.\n- **v1.1**: resolved issues with ego poses being off the drivable surface.\n- **v1.0**: initial map expansion release from july 2019. supports 11 semantic layers.\n- **nuscenes v1.0**: came with a bitmap for the semantic prior. all code is contained in nuscenes.py.\n\n### getting started with nuscenes\nplease follow these steps to make yourself familiar with the nuscenes dataset:\n- read the [dataset description](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#overview).\n- [explore](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#explore) the lidar viewer and videos.\n- [download](https://www.nuscenes.org/download) the dataset. \n- get the [nuscenes-devkit code](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit).\n- read the [online tutorial](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#tutorials) or run it yourself using:\n```\njupyter notebook $home/nuscenes-devkit/python-sdk/tutorials/nuscenes_tutorial.ipynb\n```\n- read the [nuscenes paper](https://www.nuscenes.org/publications) for a detailed analysis of the dataset.\n- run the [map expansion tutorial](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/python-sdk/tutorials/map_expansion_tutorial.ipynb).\n- take a look at the [experimental scripts](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/tree/master/python-sdk/nuscenes/scripts).\n- for instructions related to the object detection task (results format, classes and evaluation metrics), please refer to [this readme](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/python-sdk/nuscenes/eval/detection/readme.md).\n- see the [database schema](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/docs/schema_nuscenes.md) and [annotator instructions](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/docs/instructions_nuscenes.md).\n- see the [faqs](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/docs/faqs.md).\n\n## known issues\ngreat care has been taken to collate the nuscenes dataset and many users have praised the quality of the data and annotations.\nhowever, some minor issues remain:\n\n**maps**:\n- for *singapore-hollandvillage* and *singapore-queenstown* the traffic light 3d poses are all 0 (except for tz).\n- for *boston-seaport*, the ego poses of 3 scenes (499, 515, 517) are slightly incorrect and 2 scenes (501, 502) are outside the annotated area. \n- for *singapore-onenorth*, the ego poses of about 10 scenes were off the drivable surface. this has been **resolved in map v1.1**.\n- some lanes are disconnected from the rest of the lanes. we chose to keep these as they still provide valuable information. \n\n**annotations**:\n- a small number of 3d bounding boxes is annotated despite the object being temporarily occluded. for this reason we make sure to **filter objects without lidar or radar points** in the nuscenes benchmarks. see [issue 366](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/issues/366).\n\n## citation\nplease use the following citation when referencing [nuscenes or
