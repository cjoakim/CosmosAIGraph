  "description": "pyav\n====\n\n[![github test status][github-tests-badge]][github-tests] \\\n[![gitter chat][gitter-badge]][gitter] [![documentation][docs-badge]][docs] \\\n[![python package index][pypi-badge]][pypi] [![conda forge][conda-badge]][conda]\n\npyav is a pythonic binding for the [ffmpeg][ffmpeg] libraries. we aim to provide all of the power and control of the underlying library, but manage the gritty details as much as possible.\n\npyav is for direct and precise access to your media via containers, streams, packets, codecs, and frames. it exposes a few transformations of that data, and helps you get your data to/from other packages (e.g. numpy and pillow).\n\nthis power does come with some responsibility as working with media is horrendously complicated and pyav can't abstract it away or make all the best decisions for you. if the `ffmpeg` command does the job without you bending over backwards, pyav is likely going to be more of a hindrance than a help.\n\nbut where you can't work without it, pyav is a critical tool.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\ndue to the complexity of the dependencies, pyav is not always the easiest python package to install from source. since release 8.0.0 binary wheels are provided on [pypi][pypi] for linux, mac and windows linked against a modern ffmpeg. you can install these wheels by running:\n\n```bash\npip install av\n```\n\nif you want to use your existing ffmpeg, the source version of pyav is on [pypi][pypi] too:\n\n```bash\npip install av --no-binary av\n```\n\nalternative installation methods\n--------------------------------\n\nanother way of installing pyav is via [conda-forge][conda-forge]:\n\n```bash\nconda install av -c conda-forge\n```\n\nsee the [conda install][conda-install] docs to get started with (mini)conda.\n\nand if you want to build from the absolute source (for development or testing):\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:pyav-org/pyav\ncd pyav\nsource scripts/activate.sh\n\n# either install the testing dependencies:\npip install --upgrade -r tests/requirements.txt\n# or have it all, including ffmpeg, built/installed for you:\n./scripts/build-deps\n\n# build pyav.\nmake\n```\n\n---\n\nhave fun, [read the docs][docs], [come chat with us][gitter], and good luck!\n\n\n\n[conda-badge]: https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/av.svg?colorb=ccb39a\n[conda]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/av\n[docs-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-on%20pyav.org-blue.svg\n[docs]: http://pyav.org/docs\n[gitter-badge]: https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/nwjs/nw.js.svg?logo=gitter&colorb=cc2b5e\n[gitter]: https://gitter.im/pyav-org\n[pypi-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/av.svg?colorb=ccb39a\n[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/av\n\n[github-tests-badge]: https://github.com/pyav-org/pyav/workflows/tests/badge.svg\n[github-tests]: https://github.com/pyav-org/pyav/actions?workflow=tests\n[github]: https://github.com/pyav-org/pyav\n\n[ffmpeg]: http://ffmpeg.org/\n[conda-forge]: https://conda-forge.github.io/\n[conda-install]: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html\n",
