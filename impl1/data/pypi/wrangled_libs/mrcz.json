  "description": "\nmrcz is a highly optimized compressed version of the popular electron microscopy \nmrc image format.  it uses the blosc meta-compressor library as a backend.  it \ncan use a number of high-performance loseless compression codecs such as 'lz4' \nand 'zstd', it can apply bit-shuffling filters, and operates compression in a \nblocked and multi-threaded way to take advantage of modern multi-core cpus.\n\n",
