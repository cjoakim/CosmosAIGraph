  "description": "[![no maintenance intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)\n\n# purpose\nthis package contains the [asyncore](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncore.html) module as found in python versions prior to 3.12.\nit is provided so that existing code relying on `import asyncore` is able to continue being used without significant refactoring.\n\nthe module's source code is taken directly from the [python standard library](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c4d45ee670c09d4f6da709df072ec80cb7dfad22/lib/asyncore.py).\nthe specific version of [`asyncore.py`](asyncore/asyncore.py) used is the last update before the addition of removal warnings at import time, and is essentially equivalent to [the version provided with python 3.9](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/lib/asyncore.py).\n\nplease note that new projects should prefer [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).\n\n\n## installation and usage\nthis version of asyncore is intended for python 3.12 or later.\nit can be installed for earlier python versions, but will have no effect, and the standard library version of asyncore will be used in its place.\n\ninstall the module using `pip`:\n```shell\npython -m pip install pyasyncore\n```\n\nnote that the [pypi module](https://pypi.org/project/pyasyncore/) is named `pyasyncore` because creating modules with the same name as those provided by the standard library is not permitted.\nusage is still via `import asyncore`.\n\nfor guidance about using this module, see the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncore.html).\n\n\n## maintenance\ndue to the fact that this module is [no-longer supported](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/), no further maintenance of the code in [`asyncore.py`](asyncore/asyncore.py) is intended.\nthis project is only intended to be updated to make changes or improvements to the module packaging.\n\n\n## license\n[python software foundation license version 2](license)\n",
