  "description": "# microsoft azure sdk for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure subscription management client library.\nthis package has been tested with python 3.7+.\nfor a more complete view of azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).\n\n## _disclaimer_\n\n_azure sdk python packages support for python 2.7 has ended 01 january 2022. for more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_\n\n# usage\n\n\nto learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)\n \nfor docs and references, see [python sdk references](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)\ncode samples for this package can be found at [subscription management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=getting%20started%20-%20managing&terms=getting%20started%20-%20managing) on docs.microsoft.com.\nadditional code samples for different azure services are available at [samples repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)\n\n\n# provide feedback\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the\n[issues](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project. \n\n\n![impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fazure-mgmt-subscription%2freadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 3.1.1 (2022-09-05)\n\n### bugs fixed\n\n  - fix error about `api_version` in operation\n\n## 3.1.0 (2022-08-30)\n\n### features added\n\n  - model acceptownershipstatusresponse has a new parameter provisioning_state\n\n## 3.0.0 (2022-01-21)\n\n**features**\n\n  - added operation group subscriptionsoperations\n  - added operation group tenantsoperations\n  - model canceledsubscriptionid has a new parameter subscription_id\n  - model enabledsubscriptionid has a new parameter subscription_id\n  - model renamedsubscriptionid has a new parameter subscription_id\n  - model subscriptionaliasresponseproperties has a new parameter created_time\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - model canceledsubscriptionid no longer has parameter value\n  - model enabledsubscriptionid no longer has parameter value\n  - model renamedsubscriptionid no longer has parameter value\n\n## 2.0.0 (2021-11-25)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model putaliasrequestproperties has a new parameter additional_properties\n  - model operation has a new parameter is_data_action\n  - model errorresponsebody has a new parameter code\n  - model errorresponsebody has a new parameter message\n  - model operationdisplay has a new parameter description\n  - added operation subscriptionoperations.begin_accept_ownership\n  - added operation subscriptionoperations.accept_ownership_status\n  - added operation group subscriptionpolicyoperations\n  - added operation group billingaccountoperations\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - removed operation group tenantsoperations\n  - removed operation group subscriptionsoperations(subscriptionsoperations can be used in [azure-mgmt-resource](https://pypi.org/project/azure-mgmt-resource/))\n\n## 1.0.0 (2020-12-16)\n\n- ga release\n\n## 1.0.0b1 (2020-10-23)\n\nthis is beta preview version.\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).\n\ngeneral breaking changes\n\ncredential system has been completly revamped:\n\nazure.common.credentials or msrestazure.azure_active_directory instances are no longer supported, use the azure-identity classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\ncredentials parameter has been renamed credential\nthe config attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. example: myclient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=true). for a complete set of supported options, see the parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core\n\nyou can't import a version module anymore, use __version__ instead\n\noperations that used to return a msrest.polling.lropoller now returns a azure.core.polling.lropoller and are prefixed with begin_.\n\nexceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror (clouderror has been removed).\n\nmost of the operation kwarg have changed. some of the most noticeable:\n\nraw has been removed. equivalent feature can be found using cls, a callback that will give access to internal http response for advanced user\nfor a complete set of supported options, see the parameters accept in request documentation of azure-core\ngeneral new features\n\ntype annotations support using typing. sdks are mypy ready.\nthis client has now stable and official support for async. check the aio namespace of your package to find the async client.\nthis client now support natively tracing library like opencensus or opentelemetry. see this tracing quickstart for an overview.\n\n## 0.7.0 (2020-10-12)\n\n**features**\n\n  - added operation group aliasoperations\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - removed operation subscriptionoperations.create_subscription_in_enrollment_account\n  - removed operation subscriptionoperations.create_subscription\n  - removed operation subscriptionoperations.create_csp_subscription\n  - removed operation group subscriptionoperationoperations\n\n## 0.6.0 (2020-06-05)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model subscriptioncreationparameters has a new parameter management_group_id\n  -

added operation group subscriptionoperations\n  - added operation group subscriptionfactoryoperations\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*\nintroduce breaking changes if from some import. in summary, some modules\nwere incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. this fixed\nseveral issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be\nused in the first place.\n\n  - subscriptionclient cannot be imported from\n    `azure.mgmt.subscription.subscription_client` anymore (import\n    from `azure.mgmt.subscription` works like before)\n  - subscriptionclientconfiguration import has been moved from\n    `azure.mgmt.subscription.subscription_client` to\n    `azure.mgmt.subscription`\n  - a model `myclass` from a \"models\" sub-module cannot be imported\n    anymore using `azure.mgmt.subscription.models.my_class` (import\n    from `azure.mgmt.subscription.models` works like before)\n  - an operation class `myclassoperations` from an `operations`\n    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using\n    `azure.mgmt.subscription.operations.my_class_operations` (import\n    from `azure.mgmt.subscription.operations` works like before)\n\nlast but not least, http connection pooling is now enabled by default.\nyou should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or\nuse no more than one client per process.\n\n## 0.4.1 (2019-05-24)\n\n**bug fix**\n\n  - remove subscription_id as a client required parameter\n\n## 0.4.0 (2019-05-21)\n\n**features**\n\n  - added operation subscriptionsoperations.rename\n  - added operation subscriptionsoperations.cancel\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - removed operation group subscriptionfactoryoperations\n  - removed operation group subscriptionoperationoperations\n\n## 0.3.0 (2019-04-05)\n\n**features**\n\n  - added operation subscriptionfactoryoperations.create_subscription\n  - added operation group subscriptionoperationoperations\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - model subscriptioncreationparameters has a new signature\n\n**deprecation**\n\n  - removed operation\n    subscriptionfactoryoperations.create_subscription_in_enrollment_account\n  - removed operation group subscriptionoperations\n\n## 0.2.0 (2018-04-01)\n\n  - add subscription creation api\n\n## 0.1.0 (2017-12-11)\n\n  - initial release\n",
