  "description": "an implementation of rfc 7049 - concise binary object representation (cbor).\n\ncbor is comparable to json, has a superset of json's ability, but serializes to a binary format which is smaller and faster to generate and parse.\n\nthe two primary functions are cbor.loads() and cbor.dumps().\n\nthis library includes a c implementation which runs 3-5 times faster than the python standard library's c-accelerated implementanion of json. this is also includes a 100% python implementation.",
