  "description": "python interface for osqp\n=========================\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/qdldl-python/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp-python/actions\n\n\npython wrapper for `osqp <https://osqp.org/>`__: the operator\nsplitting qp solver.\n\nthe osqp (operator splitting quadratic program) solver is a numerical\noptimization package for solving problems in the form\n\n::\n\n    minimize        0.5 x' p x + q' x\n\n    subject to      l <= a x <= u\n\nwhere ``x in r^n`` is the optimization variable. the objective function\nis defined by a positive semidefinite matrix ``p in s^n_+`` and vector\n``q in r^n``. the linear constraints are defined by matrix\n``a in r^{m x n}`` and vectors ``l in r^m u {-inf}^m``,\n``u in r^m u {+inf}^m``.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nto install ``osqp`` for python, make sure that you're using a recent version of ``pip`` (``pip install --upgrade pip``)\nand then use ``pip install osqp``.\n\nto install `osqp` from source, clone the repository (``git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/osqp/osqp-python``)\nand run ``pip install .`` from inside the cloned folder.\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nthe interface is documented `here <https://osqp.org/>`__.\n\n\npackaging\n---------\nthis repository performs the tests and builds the pypi wheels. conda packages are on `conda-forge <https://github.com/conda-forge/osqp-feedstock>`__.\n",
