  "description": "# buildkite test collector for python (beta)\n\nthe official python adapter for [buildkite test analytics](https://buildkite.com/test-analytics) which collects information about your tests.\n\n**supported python versions:** >=3.8\n\n\u2692 **supported test frameworks:** pytest.\n\n\ud83d\udce6 **supported ci systems:** buildkite, github actions, circleci, and others via the `buildkite_analytics_*` environment variables.\n\n\n## \ud83d\udc49 installing\n\n1. [create a test suite](https://buildkite.com/docs/test-analytics), and copy the api token that it gives you.\n\n2. add `buildkite-test-collector` to your list of dev dependencies in `setup.py`\n\n```python\n        extras_require={\n            \"dev\": [\n                \"buildkite-test-collector\"\n            ]\n        }\n```\n\n3. set up your api token\n\nadd the `buidlkite_analytics_token` environment variable to your build system's environment.\n\n4. run your tests\n\nrun your tests like normal.  note that we attempt to detect the presence of several common ci environments, however if this fails you can set the `ci` environment variable to any value and it will work.\n\n```sh\n$ pytest\n```\n\n5. verify that it works\n\nif all is well, you should see the test run in the test analytics section of the buildkite dashboard.\n\n## \ud83c\udfa2 tracing\n\nbuildkite test analytics has support for tracing potentially slow operations within your tests (sql queries, http requests, etc).  this library now supports the ability to add tracing information to your test analytics output by using the new `spans` pytest fixture.  see the `spancollector` documentation for more information.\n\n## \ud83d\udd1c roadmap\n\nsee the [github 'enhancement' issues](https://github.com/buildkite/test-collector-python/issues?q=is%3aissue+is%3aopen+label%3aenhancement) for planned features. pull requests are always welcome, and we\u2019ll give you feedback and guidance if you choose to contribute \ud83d\udc9a\n\n## \u2692 developing\n\nafter cloning the repository, install the dependencies:\n\n```\npip install -e '.[dev]'\n```\n\nand run the tests:\n\n```\npytest\n```\n\nuseful resources for developing collectors include the [buildkite test analytics docs](https://buildkite.com/docs/test-analytics) and the [rspec and minitest collectors](https://github.com/buildkite/rspec-buildkite-analytics).\n\n## \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb contributing\n\nbug reports and pull requests are welcome on github at https://github.com/buildkite/test-collector-python\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 releasing\n\n1. version bump the code, tag and push.\n2. publish to the [python package index](https://pypi.org/):\n\n```sh\npython3 -m build\npython3 -m twine upload dist/*\n```\n\n3. create a [new github release](https://github.com/buildkite/test-collector-python/releases).\n\n## \ud83d\udcdc license\n\nthe package is available as open source under the terms of the [mit license](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit).\n\n## \ud83e\udd19 thanks\n\nthanks to the folks at [alembic](https://alembic.com.au/) for building and maintaining this package.\n",
