  "description": "# python-bitcoinlib\n\nthis python3 library provides an easy interface to the bitcoin data\nstructures and protocol. the approach is low-level and \"ground up\", with a\nfocus on providing tools to manipulate the internals of how bitcoin works.\n\n\"the swiss army knife of the bitcoin protocol.\" - wladimir j. van der laan\n\n\n## requirements\n\n    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n\nthe rpc interface, `bitcoin.rpc`, should work with bitcoin core v24.0 or later.\nolder versions may work but there do exist some incompatibilities.\n\n\n## structure\n\neverything consensus critical is found in the modules under bitcoin.core. this\nrule is followed pretty strictly, for instance chain parameters are split into\nconsensus critical and non-consensus-critical.\n\n    bitcoin.core            - basic core definitions, datastructures, and\n                              (context-independent) validation\n    bitcoin.core.key        - ecc pubkeys\n    bitcoin.core.script     - scripts and opcodes\n    bitcoin.core.scripteval - script evaluation/verification\n    bitcoin.core.serialize  - serialization\n\nin the future the bitcoin.core may use the satoshi sourcecode directly as a\nlibrary. non-consensus critical modules include the following:\n\n    bitcoin          - chain selection\n    bitcoin.base58   - base58 encoding\n    bitcoin.bloom    - bloom filters (incomplete)\n    bitcoin.net      - network communication (in flux)\n    bitcoin.messages - network messages (in flux)\n    bitcoin.rpc      - bitcoin core rpc interface support\n    bitcoin.wallet   - wallet-related code, currently bitcoin address and\n                       private key support\n\neffort has been made to follow the satoshi source relatively closely, for\ninstance python code and classes that duplicate the functionality of\ncorresponding satoshi c++ code uses the same naming conventions: ctransaction,\ncblockheader, nvalue etc. otherwise python naming conventions are followed.\n\n\n## mutable vs. immutable objects\n\nlike the bitcoin core codebase ctransaction is immutable and\ncmutabletransaction is mutable; unlike the bitcoin core codebase this\ndistinction also applies to coutpoint, ctxin, ctxout, and cblock.\n\n\n## endianness gotchas\n\nrather confusingly bitcoin core shows transaction and block hashes as\nlittle-endian hex rather than the big-endian the rest of the world uses for\nsha256. python-bitcoinlib provides the convenience functions x() and lx() in\nbitcoin.core to convert from big-endian and little-endian hex to raw bytes to\naccommodate this. in addition see b2x() and b2lx() for conversion from bytes to\nbig/little-endian hex.\n\n\n## module import style\n\nwhile not always good style, it's often convenient for quick scripts if\n`import *` can be used. to support that all the modules have `__all__` defined\nappropriately.\n\n\n# example code\n\nsee `examples/` directory. for instance this example creates a transaction\nspending a pay-to-script-hash transaction output:\n\n    $ pythonpath=. examples/spend-p2sh-txout.py\n    <hex-encoded transaction>\n\n\n## selecting the chain to use\n\ndo the following:\n\n    import bitcoin\n    bitcoin.selectparams(name)\n\nwhere name is one of 'testnet', 'mainnet', 'signet', or 'regtest'. the chain currently\nselected is a global variable that changes behavior everywhere, just like in\nthe satoshi codebase.\n\n\n## unit tests\n\nunder bitcoin/tests using test data from bitcoin core. to run them:\n\n    python3 -m unittest discover\n\nalternately, if tox (see https://tox.readthedocs.org/) is available on your\nsystem, you can run unit tests for multiple python versions:\n\n    ./runtests.sh\n\nhtml coverage reports can then be found in the htmlcov/ subdirectory.\n\n\n## documentation\n\nsphinx documentation is in the \"doc\" subdirectory. run \"make help\" from there\nto see how to build. you will need the python \"sphinx\" package installed.\n\ncurrently this is just api documentation generated from the code and\ndocstrings. higher level written docs would be useful, perhaps starting with\nmuch of this readme. pages are written in restructuredtext and linked from\nindex.rst.\n\n\n",
