  "description": "\n# the uwsgi server as a python module\n\n## install\n\n```\npip install pyuwsgi\n```\n\n## run\n\nuwsgi will get installed to your python path with a console script named `pyuwsgi`. to\nmake it a full drop-in replacement it will install a script named `uwsgi` as well.\n\nyou can also call it directly in your python code with a list of valid uwsgi options:\n\n```python\nimport pyuwsgi\npyuwsgi.run([\"--help\"])\n```\n\n## differences from uwsgi\n\nthis is built from uwsgi's source without any modifications.\na different [`setup.py`](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/blob/uwsgi-2.0/setup.pyuwsgi.py)\nis used to make the project a friendlier part of the python ecosystem. it allows it\nto be imported as a python module and distributed using the\n[wheel format](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/). the pre-packaged wheels\ninclude the following common libraries used by uwsgi:\n\n* [zlib](https://zlib.net/)\n* [pcre](https://www.pcre.org/)\n* [jansson](http://www.digip.org/jansson/)\n\nssl is intentionally excluded for security reasons. if you need ssl support, you can\nforce a wheel to be built locally with the `pip` flag `--no-binary=pyuwsgi`.\n\nin addition to the default plugins, the [`stats_pusher_statsd`](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metrics.html#statsd)\nplugin is included by default in `pyuwsgi` where it is typically optional for uwsgi.\n\nthe full uwsgi documentation can be found at\n[https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io).\n\n## license\n\nuwsgi is licensed [gplv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt) with\na [linking exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gpl_linking_exception) which means\nyou are allowed to use uwsgi (or pyuwsgi) unmodified in a proprietary or otherwise non-gpl\nlicensed project without invoking the gpl on the rest of the code.\n\nthe [full license](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/blob/uwsgi-2.0/license) can be found\non github.\n\n---\n\n[![lincoln loop](https://cldup.com/gynz5rftkr.png)](https://lincolnloop.com)\n\n`pyuwsgi` is sponsored by [lincoln loop](https://lincolnloop.com).\n\n[![unbit](https://cldup.com/ttnag1zlcw.png)](http://unbit.com/)\n\n`uwsgi` is the creation of [unbit](http://unbit.com/).\n\n",
