  "description": "# pyside2\n\n### introduction\n\npyside2 is the official python module from the\n[qt for python project](http://wiki.qt.io/qt_for_python),\nwhich provides access to the complete qt 5.12+ framework.\n\nthe qt for python project is developed in the open, with all facilities you'd expect\nfrom any modern oss project such as all code in a git repository and an open\ndesign process. we welcome any contribution conforming to the\n[qt contribution agreement](https://www.qt.io/contributionagreement/).\n\n### installation\n\nsince the release of the [technical preview](https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/06/13/qt-python-5-11-released/)\nit is possible to install via `pip`, both from qt's servers\nand [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyside2/):\n\n    pip install pyside2\n\n#### dependencies\n\npyside2 versions following 5.12 use a c++ parser based on\n[clang](http://clang.org/). the clang library (c-bindings), version 6.0 or\nhigher is required for building. prebuilt versions of it can be downloaded from\n[download.qt.io](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/libclang/).\n\nafter unpacking the archive, set the environment variable *llvm_install_dir* to\npoint to the folder containing the *include* and *lib* directories of clang:\n\n    7z x .../libclang-release_60-linux-rhel7.2-gcc5.3-x86_64-clazy.7z\n    export llvm_install_dir=$pwd/libclang\n\non windows:\n\n    7z x .../libclang-release_60-windows-vs2015_64-clazy.7z\n    set llvm_install_dir=%cd%\\libclang\n\n### building from source\n\nfor building pyside2 from scratch, please read about\n[getting started](https://wiki.qt.io/qt_for_python/gettingstarted).\nthis process will include getting the code:\n\n    git clone https://code.qt.io/pyside/pyside-setup\n    cd pyside-setup\n    git branch --track 5.12 origin/5.12\n    git checkout 5.12\n\nthen install the dependencies, and following the instructions per platform.\na common build command will look like:\n\n    python setup.py install --qmake=<path/to/qmake/> --parallel=8 --build-tests\n\nyou can obtain more information about the options to build pyside\nand shiboken in [our wiki](https://wiki.qt.io/qt_for_python/).\n\n### documentation and bugs\n\nyou can find more information about the pyside2 module api in the\n[official qt for python documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/).\n\nif you come across any issue, please file a bug report at our\n[jira tracker](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/pyside) following\nour [guidelines](https://wiki.qt.io/qt_for_python/reporting_bugs).\n\n### community\n\ncheck *#qt-pyside*, our official irc channel on freenode,\nor contact us via our [mailing list](http://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo/pyside).\n\n### licensing\n\npyside2 is available under both open source (lgplv3/gplv2) and commercial license.\nusing pypi is the recommended installation source, because the content of the wheels is valid for both cases.\nfor more information, refer to the [qt licensing page](https://www.qt.io/licensing/).\n\n\n",
