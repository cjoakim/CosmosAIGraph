  "description": "empy is a powerful, robust and mature\ntemplating system for inserting python code in template text.  empy\ntakes a source document, processes it, and produces output.  this is\naccomplished via expansions, which are signals to the empy system\nwhere to act and are indicated with markup.  markup is set off by a\ncustomizable prefix (by default the at sign, `@`).  empy can expand\narbitrary python expressions, statements and control structures in\nthis way, as well as a variety of additional special forms.  the\nremaining textual data is sent to the output, allowing python to be\nused in effect as a markup language.\n\n\n",
