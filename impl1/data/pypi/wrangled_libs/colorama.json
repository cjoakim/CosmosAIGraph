it looks the same as 'normal text'.\n\nusage\n-----\n\ninitialisation\n..............\n\nif the only thing you want from colorama is to get ansi escapes to work on\nwindows, then run:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\n    just_fix_windows_console()\n\nif you're on a recent version of windows 10 or better, and your stdout/stderr\nare pointing to a windows console, then this will flip the magic configuration\nswitch to enable windows' built-in ansi support.\n\nif you're on an older version of windows, and your stdout/stderr are pointing to\na windows console, then this will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and/or ``sys.stderr`` in a\nmagic file object that intercepts ansi escape sequences and issues the\nappropriate win32 calls to emulate them.\n\nin all other circumstances, it does nothing whatsoever. basically the idea is\nthat this makes windows act like unix with respect to ansi escape handling.\n\nit's safe to call this function multiple times. it's safe to call this function\non non-windows platforms, but it won't do anything. it's safe to call this\nfunction when one or both of your stdout/stderr are redirected to a file \u2013 it\nwon't do anything to those streams.\n\nalternatively, you can use the older interface with more features (but also more\npotential footguns):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import init\n    init()\n\nthis does the same thing as ``just_fix_windows_console``, except for the\nfollowing differences:\n\n- it's not safe to call ``init`` multiple times; you can end up with multiple\n  layers of wrapping and broken ansi support.\n\n- colorama will apply a heuristic to guess whether stdout/stderr support ansi,\n  and if it thinks they don't, then it will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and\n  ``sys.stderr`` in a magic file object that strips out ansi escape sequences\n  before printing them. this happens on all platforms, and can be convenient if\n  you want to write your code to emit ansi escape sequences unconditionally, and\n  let colorama decide whether they should actually be output. but note that\n  colorama's heuristic is not particularly clever.\n\n- ``init`` also accepts explicit keyword args to enable/disable various\n  functionality \u2013 see below.\n\nto stop using colorama before your program exits, simply call ``deinit()``.\nthis will restore ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to their original values, so that\ncolorama is disabled. to resume using colorama again, call ``reinit()``; it is\ncheaper than calling ``init()`` again (but does the same thing).\n\nmost users should depend on ``colorama >= 0.4.6``, and use\n``just_fix_windows_console``. the old ``init`` interface will be supported\nindefinitely for backwards compatibility, but we don't plan to fix any issues\nwith it, also for backwards compatibility.\n\ncolored output\n..............\n\ncross-platform printing of colored text can then be done using colorama's\nconstant shorthand for ansi escape sequences. these are deliberately\nrudimentary, see below.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import fore, back, style\n    print(fore.red + 'some red text')\n    print(back.green + 'and with a green background')\n    print(style.dim + 'and in dim text')\n    print(style.reset_all)\n    print('back to normal now')\n\n...or simply by manually printing ansi sequences from your own code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    print('\\033[31m' + 'some red text')\n    print('\\033[39m') # and reset to default color\n\n...or, colorama can be used in conjunction with existing ansi libraries\nsuch as the venerable `termcolor <https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/>`_\nthe fabulous `blessings <https://pypi.org/project/blessings/>`_,\nor the incredible `_rich <https://pypi.org/project/rich/>`_.\n\nif you wish colorama's fore, back and style constants were more capable,\nthen consider using one of the above highly capable libraries to generate\ncolors, etc, and use colorama just for its primary purpose: to convert\nthose ansi sequences to also work on windows:\n\nsimilarly, do not send prs adding the generation of new ansi types to colorama.\nwe are only interested in converting ansi codes to win32 api calls, not\nshortcuts like the above to generate ansi characters.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\n    from termcolor import colored\n\n    # use colorama to make termcolor work on windows too\n    just_fix_windows_console()\n\n    # then use termcolor for all colored text output\n    print(colored('hello, world!', 'green', 'on_red'))\n\navailable formatting constants are::\n\n    fore: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, reset.\n    back: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, reset.\n    style: dim, normal, bright, reset_all\n\n``style.reset_all`` resets foreground, background, and brightness. colorama will\nperform this reset automatically on program exit.\n\nthese are fairly well supported, but not part of the standard::\n\n    fore: lightblack_ex, lightred_ex, lightgreen_ex, lightyellow_ex, lightblue_ex, lightmagenta_ex, lightcyan_ex, lightwhite_ex\n    back: lightblack_ex, lightred_ex, lightgreen_ex, lightyellow_ex, lightblue_ex, lightmagenta_ex, lightcyan_ex, lightwhite_ex\n\ncursor positioning\n..................\n\nansi codes to reposition the cursor are supported. see ``demos/demo06.py`` for\nan example of how to generate them.\n\ninit keyword args\n.................\n\n``init()`` accepts some ``**kwargs`` to override default behaviour.\n\ninit(autoreset=false):\n    if you find yourself repeatedly sending reset sequences to turn off color\n    changes at the end of every print, then ``init(autoreset=true)`` will\n    automate that:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        from colorama import init\n        init(autoreset=true)\n        print(fore.red + 'some red text')\n        print('automatically back to default color again')\n\ninit(strip=none):\n    pass ``true`` or ``false`` to override whether ansi codes should be\n    stripped from the output. the default behaviour is to strip if on windows\n    or if output is redirected (not a tty).\n\ninit(convert=none):\n    pass ``true`` or ``false`` to override whether to convert ansi codes in the\n    output into win32 calls. the default behaviour is to convert if on windows\n    and output is to a tty (terminal).\n\ninit(wrap=true):\n    on windows, colorama works by replacing ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``\n    with proxy objects, which override the ``.write()`` method to do their work.\n    if this wrapping causes you problems, then this can be disabled by passing\n    ``init(wrap=false)``. the default behaviour is to wrap if ``autoreset`` or\n    ``strip`` or ``convert`` are true.\n\n    when wrapping is disabled, colored printing on non-windows platforms will\n    continue to work as normal. to do cross-platform colored output, you can\n    use colorama's ``ansitowin32`` proxy directly:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        import sys\n        from colorama import init, ansitowin32\n        init(wrap=false)\n        stream = ansitowin32(sys.stderr).stream\n\n        # python 2\n        print >>stream, fore.blue + 'blue text on stderr'\n\n        # python 3\n        print(fore.blue + 'blue text on stderr', file=stream)\n\nrecognised ansi sequences\n.........................\n\nansi sequences generally take the form::\n\n    esc [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>\n\nwhere ``<param>`` is an integer, and ``<command>`` is a single letter. zero or\nmore params are passed to a ``<command>``. if no params are passed, it is\ngenerally synonymous with passing a single zero. no spaces exist in the\nsequence; they have been inserted here simply to read more easily.\n\nthe only ansi sequences that colorama converts into win32 calls are::\n\n    esc [ 0 m       # reset all (colors and brightness)\n    esc [ 1 m       # bright\n    esc [ 2 m       # dim (looks same as normal brightness)\n    esc [ 22 m      # normal brightness\n\n    # foreground:\n    esc [ 30 m      # black\n    esc [ 31 m      # red\n    esc [ 32 m      # green\n    esc [ 33 m      # yellow\n    esc [ 34 m      # blue\n    esc [ 35 m      # magenta\n    esc [ 36 m      # cyan\n    esc [ 37 m      # white\n    esc [ 39 m      # reset\n\n    # background\n    esc [ 40 m      # black\n    esc [ 41 m      # red\n    esc [ 42 m      # green\n    esc [ 43 m      # yellow\n    esc [ 44 m      # blue\n    esc [ 45 m      # magenta\n    esc [ 46 m      # cyan\n    esc [ 47 m      # white\n    esc [ 49 m      # reset\n\n    # cursor positioning\n    esc [ y;x h     # position cursor at x across, y down\n    esc [ y;x f     # position cursor at x across, y down\n    esc [ n a       # move cursor n lines up\n    esc [ n b       # move cursor n lines down\n    esc [ n c       # move cursor n characters forward\n    esc [ n d       # move cursor n characters backward\n\n    # clear the screen\n    esc [ mode j    # clear the screen\n\n    # clear the line\n    esc [ mode k    # clear the line\n\nmultiple numeric params to the ``'m'`` command can be combined into a single\nsequence::\n\n    esc [ 36 ; 45 ; 1 m     # bright cyan text on magenta background\n\nall other ansi sequences of the form ``esc [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>``\nare silently stripped from the output on windows.\n\nany other form of ansi sequence, such as single-character codes or alternative\ninitial characters, are not recognised or stripped. it would be cool to add\nthem though. let me know if it would be useful for you, via the issues on\ngithub.\n\nstatus & known problems\n-----------------------\n\ni've personally only tested it on windows xp (cmd, console2), ubuntu\n(gnome-terminal, xterm), and os x.\n\nsome valid ansi sequences aren't recognised.\n\nif you're hacking on the code, see `readme-hacking.md`_. especially, see the\nexplanation there of why we do not want prs that allow colorama to generate new\ntypes of ansi codes.\n\nsee outstanding issues and wish-list:\nhttps://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues\n\nif anything doesn't work for you, or doesn't do what you expected or hoped for,\ni'd love to hear about it on that issues list, would be delighted by patches,\nand would be happy to grant commit access to anyone who submits a working patch\nor two.\n\n.. _readme-hacking.md: readme-hacking.md\n\nlicense\n-------\n\ncopyright jonathan hartley & arnon yaari, 2013-2020. bsd 3-clause license;
