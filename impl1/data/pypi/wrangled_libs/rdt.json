(see the [transformers glossary](https://docs.sdv.dev/rdt/transformers-glossary/browse-transformers) for more information).\n\n## fitting & using the hypertransformer\n\nthe `hypertransformer` references the config while learning the data during the `fit` stage.\n\n```python3\nht.fit(customers)\n```\n\nonce the transformer is fit, it's ready to use. use the transform method to transform all columns\nof your dataset at once.\n\n```python3\ntransformed_data = ht.transform(customers)\n```\n\n```\n   last_login.value  email_optin.value  credit_card.value  age.value  dollars_spent.value\n0      1.624666e+18                0.0                0.2         29                99.99\n1      1.612915e+18                0.0                0.2         18                36.87\n2      1.611814e+18                0.0                0.5         21                 2.50\n3      1.601078e+18                1.0                0.7         45                25.00\n4      1.608595e+18                0.0                0.9         32                19.99\n```\n\nthe ``hypertransformer`` applied the assigned transformer to each individual column. each column\nnow contains fully numerical data that you can use for your project!\n\nwhen you're done with your project, you can also transform the data back to the original format\nusing the `reverse_transform` method.\n\n```python3\noriginal_format_data = ht.reverse_transform(transformed_data)\n```\n\n```\n  last_login email_optin credit_card  age  dollars_spent\n0        nat       false        visa   29          99.99\n1 2021-02-10       false        visa   18            nan\n2        nat       false        amex   21            nan\n3 2020-09-26        true         nan   45          25.00\n4 2020-12-22       false    discover   32          19.99\n```\n\n# what's next?\n\nto learn more about reversible data transformations, visit the [rdt documentation](https://docs.sdv.dev/rdt).\n\n\n---\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://datacebo.com\"><img align=\"center\" width=40% src=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/sdv/blob/stable/docs/images/datacebo.png\"></img></a>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n[the synthetic data vault project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at mit's [data to ai lab](\nhttps://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. after 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we\ncreated [datacebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.\ntoday, datacebo is the proud developer of sdv, the largest ecosystem for\nsynthetic data generation & evaluation. it is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic\ndata, including:\n\n* \ud83d\udd04 data discovery & transformation. reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.\n* \ud83e\udde0 multiple machine learning models -- ranging from copulas to deep learning -- to create tabular,\n  multi table and time series data.\n* \ud83d\udcca measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data\n  generation models.\n\n[get started using the sdv package](https://sdv.dev/sdv/getting_started/install.html) -- a fully\nintegrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. or, use the standalone libraries\nfor specific needs.\n\n\n# history\n\n## 1.9.0 - 2023-11-14\n\nthis release adds a parameter to the `unixtimestampencoder` and `optimizedtimestampencoder`, called `enforce_min_max_values`. when this is set to true, it clips all values in the reverse transformed data to the min and max datetimes seen in the fitted data.\n\nthis release also internally adds support for multi-column transformers!\n\n### new features\n\n* support multi-column transformers -

2023-08-22\n\nthis release adds 3 new transformers:\n\n1. `uniformencoder` - a categorical and boolean transformer that converts the column into a uniform distribution.\n2. `ordereduniformencoder` - the same as above, but the order for the categories can be specified, changing which range in the uniform distribution each category belongs to.\n3. `idgenerator`- a text transformer that drops the input column during transform and returns ids during reverse transform. the ids all take the form \\<prefix>\\<number>\\<suffix> and can be configured with a custom prefix, suffix and starting point.\n\nadditionally, the `anonymizedfaker` is enhanced to support the text sdtype. \n\n### deprecations\n\n* the `get_input_sdtype` method is being deprecated in favor of `get_supported_sdtypes`.\n\n### new features\n\n* create idgenerator transformer - issue [#675](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/675) by @r-palazzo\n* add uniformencoder (and its ordered version) - issue [#678](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/678) by @r-palazzo\n* allow me to use anonymizedfaker with sdtype text columns - issue [#688](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/688) by @amontanez24\n\n### maintenance\n\n* deprecate get_input_sdtype - issue [#682](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/682) by @r-palazzo\n\n## 1.6.1 - 2023-08-02\n\nthis release updates the default transformers used for certain sdtypes. it also enables the `anonymizedfaker` and `pseudoanonymizedfaker` to work with any sdtype besides boolean, categorical, datetime, numerical or text.\n\n### bugs\n\n* [enterprise usage] unable to assign generic pii transformers (eg. anonymizedfaker) - issue [#674](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/674) by @amontanez24\n\n### new features\n\n* update the default transformers that hypertransformer assigns to each sdtype - issue [#664](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/664) by @amontanez24\n\n## 1.6.0 - 2023-07-12\n\nthis release adds the ability to generate missing values to the `anonymizedfaker`. users can now provide the `missing_value_generation` parameter during initialization. they can set it to `none` to not generate any missing values, or `'random'` to generate random missing values in the same proportion as the fitted data.\n\nadditionally, this release improves the `nulltransformer` by allowing nulls to be replaced on the forward transform even if `missing_value_generation` is set to none. it also fixes a bug that was causing the `unixtimestampencoder` to return a different dtype than the input on `reverse_transform`. this was particularly problematic when datetime columns are represented as ints.\n\n### new features\n\n* anonymizedfaker should be able to model and generate missing values - issue [#660](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/660) by @r-palazzo\n\n### bugs\n\n* the datetime transformers don't give me back the same dtype sometimes - issue [#657](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/657) by @frances-h\n* rdt nulltransformer doesn't replace nulls if missing_value_generation is none - issue [#658](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/658) by @amontanez24\n\n### maintenance\n\n* remove python 3.7 builds - issue [#663](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/663) by @amontanez24\n* drop support for python 3.7 - issue [#666](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/666) by @amontanez24\n\n### internal\n\n* add add-on modules to sys.modules - issue [#653](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/653) by @amontanez24\n\n## 1.5.0 - 2023-06-01\n\nthis release adds a new parameter called `missing_value_generation` to the initialization of certain transformers to specify how missing values should be created. the parameter can be used in the `floatformatter`, `binaryencoder`, `unixtimestampencoder`, `optimizedtimestampencoder`, `gaussiannormalizer` and `clusterbasednormalizer`. additionally, it fixes a bug that was causing every column that had nulls to generate them in the same place.\n\n### deprecations\n\n* the `model_missing_values` parameter is being deprecated in favor of the new `missing_value_generation` parameter.\n\n### bugs\n\n* fix randomization when creating null values - issue [#639](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/639) by @fealho\n\n### new features\n\n* allow a no-op handling strategy for missing values (nulls) - issue [#644](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/644) by @pvk-developer\n* add add-on detection for premium transformers - issue [#646](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/646) by @frances-h\n\n### maintenance\n\n* performance tests still fragile - issue [#641](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/641) by @fealho\n* investigate removing quality tests - issue [#642](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/642) by @amontanez24\n\n## 1.4.2 - 2023-05-02\n\nthis release fixes a bug that caused datetime and numerical transformers to crash if a column was all nans. additionally, it adds support for pandas 2.0!\n\n### bugs\n\n* numerical & datetime transformers crash if the entire column is null - issue [#637](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/637) by @fraces-h\n\n### maintenance\n\n* remove upper bound for pandas - issue [#633](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/633) by @pvk-developer\n\n## 1.4.1 - 2023-04-25\n\nthis release patches an issue that prevented the `regexgenerator` from working with regexes that had a very large number of possible combinations.\n\n### bugs\n\n* regexgenerator continues to have problems if there are too many possibilities - issue [#635](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/635) by @pvk-developer\n\n## 1.4.0 - 2023-04-13\n\nthis release adds a couple of new features including adding the `orderedlabelencoder` and deprecating the `customlabelencoder`. it also adds a change that makes all generator type transformers in the `hypertransformer` use a different random seed.\n\nadditionally, bugs were patched in the `regexgenerator` that caused it to crash or take too long in certain cases. finally, this release improved the detection of faker functions in the `anonymizedfaker`.\n\n### bugs\n\n* find nested faker provider submodules - pr [#630](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/pull/630) by @frances-h\n* regexgenerator fails to generate values if there are too many possibilities - issue [#623](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/623) by @r-palazzo\n* regexgenerator takes too much time and runs out of memory if there are too many possibilities - issue [#624](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/624) by @r-palazzo\n\n### new features\n\n* choose a different seed for each transformer - issue [#619](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/619) by @fealho\n* rename customlabelencoder to orderedlabelencoder - issue [#621](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/621) by @r-palazzo\n* add functionality to find version add-on - issue [#620](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/620) by @frances-h\n\n## 1.3.0 - 2023-01-18\n\nthis release makes changes to the way that individual transformers are stored in the `hypertransformer`. when accessing the config via `hypertransformer.get_config()`, the transformers listed in the config are now the actual transformer instances used during fitting and transforming. these instances can now be accessed and used to examine their properties post fitting. for example, you can now view the mapping for a `pseudoanonymizedfaker` instance using `pseudoanonymizedfaker.get_mapping()` on the instance retrieved from the config.\n\nadditionally, the output of `reverse_tranform` no longer appends the `.value` suffix to every unnamed output column. only output columns that are created from context extracted from the input columns will have suffixes (eg. `.normalized` in the `clusterbasednormalizer`).\n\nthe `anonymizedfaker` and `regexgenerator` now have an `enforce_uniqueness` parameter, which controls whether the data returned by `reverse_transform` should be unique. the `hypertransformer` now has a method called `create_anonymized_columns` that can be used to generate columns that are matched with anonymizing transformers like `anonymizedfaker` and `regexgenerator`. the method can be used as follows:\n`hypertransformer.create_anonymized_columns(num_rows=5, column_names=['email_optin', 'credit_card'])`\n\nanother major change in this release is the ability to control randomization. every time a `hypertransformer` is initialized, its randomness will be reset to the same seed, and it will yield the same results for `reverse_transform` if given the same input. every subsequent call to `reverse_transform` yields a different result. if a user desires to reset the seed, they can call `hypertransformer.reset_randomization`.\n\nfinally, this release adds support for python 3.10 and drops support for 3.6.\n\n### bugs\n\n* the reset_randomization should also apply to fit and transform - issue [#608](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/608) by @amontanez24\n* cannot print customlabelencoder: valueerror - issue [#607](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/607) by @amontanez24\n* float formatter learn_rounding_scheme doesn't work on all digits -

2022-8-17\n\nthis release adds a new transformer called the `pseudoanonymizedfaker`. this transformer enables the pseudo-anonymization of your data by mapping all of a column's original values to fake values that get returned during the reverse transformation process. each original value is always mapped to the same fake value.\n\nadditionally, this release enables the `hypertransformer` to use categorical transformers on boolean columns. it also introduces a new parameter called `computer_representation` to the `floatformatter` that will allow for values to be clipped to certain bounds based on the computer type used for a numerical column.\n\nfinally, this release patches a bug that caused unpredicatable results from the `reverse_transform` method of the `frequencyencoder` when `add_noise` is enabled.\n\n### new features\n\n* add pseudoanonymizedfaker transformer -

issue [#524](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/524) by @pvk-developer\n\n## 1.1.0 - 2022-6-9\n\nthis release adds multiple new transformers: the `customlabelencoder` and the `regexgenerator`. the `customlabelencoder` works similarly \nto the `labelencoder`, except it allows users to provide the order of the categories. the `regexgenerator` allows users to specify a regex\npattern and will generate values that match that pattern.\n\nthis release also improves current transformers. the `labelencoder` now has a parameter called `order_by` that allows users to specify the \nordering scheme for their data (eg. order numerically or alphabetically). the `labelencoder` also now has a parameter called `add_noise` \nthat allows users to specify whether or not uniform noise should be added to the transformed data. performance enhancements were made for the \n`gaussiannormalizer` by removing an unnecessary distribution search and the `floatformatter` will no longer round values to any place higher \nthan the ones place by default.\n\n### new features\n\n* add noise parameter to labelencoder -

2022-3-7\n\nthis release fixes multiple bugs concerning the `hypertransformer`. one is that the `get_transformer_tree_yaml` method no longer crashes on\nevery call. another is that calling the `update_field_data_types` and `update_default_data_type_transformers` after fitting no longer breaks the `transform`\nmethod.\n\nthe `hypertransformer` now sorts its outputs for both `transform` and `reverse_transform` based on the order of the input's columns. it is also now possible\nto create transformers that simply drops columns during `transform` and don't return any new columns.\n\n### new features\n\n* support dropping a column trough a transformer - issue [#393](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/393) by @pvk-developer\n* hypertransformer should sort columns after transform and reverse_transform - issue [#405](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/405) by @fealho\n\n### bugs\n\n* get_transformer_tree_yaml fails - issue [#389](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/389) by @amontanez24\n* hypertransformer _unfit method not working correctly - issue [#390](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/390) by @amontanez24\n* blank dataframe after updating the data types - issue [#401](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/401) by @amontanez24\n\n## 0.6.3 - 2022-2-4\n\nthis release adds a new module to the `rdt` library called `performance`. this module can be used to evaluate the speed and peak memory usage\nof any transformer in rdt. this release also increases the maximum acceptable version of scikit-learn to make it more compatible with other libraries\nin the `sdv` ecosystem. on top of that, it fixes a bug related to a new version of `pandas`.\n\n### new features\n\n* move profiling functions into rdt library - issue [#353](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/353) by @amontanez24\n\n### housekeeping\n\n* increase scikit-learn dependency range - issue [#351](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/351) by @amontanez24\n* pandas 1.4.0 release causes a small error - issue [#358](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/358) by @fealho\n\n### bugs\n\n* performance tests get stuck on unix if multiprocessing is involved - issue [#337](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/337) by @amontanez24\n\n## 0.6.2 - 2021-12-28\n\nthis release adds a new `bayesgmmtransformer`. this transformer can be used to convert a numerical column into two\ncolumns: a discrete column indicating the selected `component` of the gmm for each row, and a continuous column containing\nthe normalized value of each row based on the `mean` and `std` of the selected `component`. it is useful when the column being transformed\ncame from multiple distributions.\n\nthis release also adds multiple new methods to the `hypertransformer` api. these allow for users to access the specfic\ntransformers used on each input field, as well as view the entire tree of transformers that are used when running `transform`.\nthe exact methods are:\n\n* `basetransformer.get_input_columns()` - return list of input columns for a transformer.\n* `basetransformer.get_output_columns()` - return list of output columns for a transformer.\n* `hypertransformer.get_transformer(field)` - return the transformer instance used for a field.\n* `hypertransformer.get_output_transformers(field)` - return dictionary mapping output columns of a field to the transformers used on them.\n* `hypertransformer.get_final_output_columns(field)` - return list of all final output columns related to a field.\n* `hypertransformer.get_transformer_tree_yaml()` - return yaml representation of transformers tree.\n\nadditionally, this release fixes a bug where the `hypertransformer` was incorrectly raising a `notfittederror`. it also improved the\n`datetimetransformer` by autonomously detecting if a column needs to be converted from `dtype` `object` to `dtype` `datetime`.\n\n### new features\n\n* cast column to datetime if specified in field transformers - issue [#321](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/321) by @amontanez24\n* add a bayesiangmm transformer - issue [#183](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/183) by @fealho\n* add transformer tree structure and traversal methods - issue [#330](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/330) by @amontanez24\n\n### bugs fixed\n\n* hypertransformer raises notfittederror after fitting - issue [#332](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/332) by @amontanez24\n\n## 0.6.1 - 2021-11-10\n\nthis release adds support for python 3.9! it also removes unused document files.\n\n### internal improvements\n\n* add support for python 3.9 - issue [#323](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/323) by @amontanez24\n* remove docs - pr [#322](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/pull/322) by @pvk-developer\n\n## 0.6.0 - 2021-10-29\n\nthis release makes major changes to the underlying code for rdt as well as the api for both the `hypertransformer` and `basetransformer`.\nthe changes enable the following functionality:\n\n* the `hypertransformer` can now apply a sequence of transformers to a column.\n* transformers can now take multiple columns as an input.\n* rdt has been expanded to allow for infinite data types to be added instead of being restricted to `pandas.dtypes`.\n* users can define acceptable output types for running `hypertransformer.transform`.\n* the `hypertransformer` will continuously apply transformations to the input fields until only acceptable data types are in the output. \n* transformers can return data of any data type.\n* transformers now have named outputs and output types.\n* transformers can suggest which transformer to use on any of their outputs.\n\nto take advantage of this functionality, the following api changes were made:\n\n* the `hypertransformer` has new initialization parameters that allow users to specify data types for any field in their data as well as\nspecify which transformer to use for a field or data type. the parameters are:\n    * `field_transformers` - a dictionary allowing users to specify which transformer to use for a field or derived field. derived fields\n    are fields created by running `transform` on the input data.\n    * `field_data_types` - a dictionary allowing users to specify the data type of a field.\n    * `default_data_type_transformers` - a dictionary allowing users to specify the default transformer to use for a data type.\n    * `transform_output_types` - a dictionary allowing users to specify which data types are acceptable for the output of `transform`.\n    this is a result of the fact that transformers can now be applied in a sequence, and not every transformer will return numeric data.\n* methods were also added to the `hypertransformer` to allow these parameters to be modified. these include `get_field_data_types`,\n`update_field_data_types`, `get_default_data_type_transformers`, `update_default_data_type_transformers` and `set_first_transformers_for_fields`.\n* the `basetransformer` now requires the column names it will transform to be provided to `fit`, `transform` and `reverse_transform`.\n* the `basetransformer` added the following method to allow for users to see its output fields and output types: `get_output_types`.\n* the `basetransformer` added the following method to allow for users to see the next suggested transformer for each output field:\n`get_next_transformers`. \n\non top of the changes to the api and the capabilities of rdt, many automated checks and tests were also added to ensure that contributions\nto the library abide by the current code style, stay performant and result in data of a high quality. these tests run on every push to the\nrepository. they can also be run locally via the following functions:\n\n* `validate_transformer_code_style` - checks that new code follows the code style.\n* `validate_transformer_quality` - tests that new transformers yield data that maintains relationships between columns.\n* `validate_transformer_performance` - tests that new transformers don't take too much time or memory.\n* `validate_transformer_unit_tests` - checks that the unit tests cover all new code, follow naming conventions and pass.\n* `validate_transformer_integration` - checks that the integration tests follow naming conventions and pass.\n\n### new features\n\n* update hypertransformer api - issue [#298](https://github.com/sdv-dev/rdt/issues/298) by @amontanez24\n* create validate_pull_request function -
