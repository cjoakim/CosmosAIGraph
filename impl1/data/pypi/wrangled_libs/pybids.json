  "description": "# pybids\n[![doi](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01294/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01294)\n[![doi](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2537312.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2537312)\n\n[![binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bids-standard/pybids/master)\n[![pypi version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pybids.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pybids)\n[![conda version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/pybids)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pybids)\n\npybids is a python library to centralize interactions with datasets conforming\nbids (brain imaging data structure) format.  for more information about bids\nvisit https://bids.neuroimaging.io.\n\npybids currently supports python 3 on posix operating systems (including mac os).  windows is not officially supported, though most pybids functionality will probably work fine.\n\n## installation\npybids is most easily installed from pip. to install the latest official release:\n\n> pip install pybids\n\nor, alternatively via conda:\n\n> conda install -c conda-forge pybids\n\nif you want to live on the bleeding edge, you can install from master:\n\n> pip install git+https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids.git\n\n#### dependencies\npybids has a number of dependencies. the core querying functionality requires only the `bids-validator` package. however, most other modules require the core python neuroimaging stack: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, and `nibabel`. the `reports` module additionally requires `num2words`. by default, all dependencies will be installed with pybids (if they aren't already available).\n\n## usage\nget started by checking out [the documentation](https://bids-standard.github.io/pybids)!\n\nor you can start at [our tutorial](https://bids-standard.github.io/pybids/examples/pybids_tutorial.html)! you can run it interactively without installing anything via [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bids-standard/pybids/master). click on the link and then navigate to `doc/examples/pybids_tutorial.md` to explore.\n\n## how to cite\nto credit pybids in your work, please cite both the [joss paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01294) and the [zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/record/3363985). the former provides a high level description of the package, and the latter points to a permanent record of all pybids versions (we encourage you to cite the specific version you used). example citations (for pybids 0.9.3):\n\nyarkoni et al., (2019). pybids: python tools for bids datasets. journal of open source software, 4(40), 1294, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01294\n\nyarkoni, tal, markiewicz, christopher j., de la vega, alejandro, gorgolewski, krzysztof j., halchenko, yaroslav o., salo, taylor, \u2026 blair, ross. (2019, august 8). bids-standard/pybids: 0.9.3 (version 0.9.3). zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3363985\n\n## community guidelines\nbug reports, feedback, and other contributions to pybids are welcome. to report a bug, request a feature, or raise a technical (non-usage-related) question for discussion, please [open an issue on github](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids/issues). requests for support and questions about usage (where no bug is suspected) should be posted on the [neurostars](https://neurostars.org) forum. for questions about the [bids specification](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification) or [bids-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator), please see the corresponding repositories. for general bids-related discussion, see the [bids-discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion) mailing list.\n\npull requests are always welcome. if you have any doubts about the suitability of a pr, or want to discuss implementation-related issues, feel free to open an issue for discussion.\n",
