  "description": "py_stringmatching\n=================\n\nthis project seeks to build a python software package that consists of a comprehensive and scalable set of string tokenizers (such as alphabetical tokenizers, whitespace tokenizers) and string similarity measures (such as edit distance, jaccard, tf/idf). the package is free, open-source, and bsd-licensed.\n\nimportant links\n===============\n\n * project homepage: https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/projects/magellan/py_stringmatching\n * code repository: https://github.com/anhaidgroup/py_stringmatching\n * user manual: https://anhaidgroup.github.io/py_stringmatching/v0.4.2/index.html\n * tutorial: https://anhaidgroup.github.io/py_stringmatching/v0.4.2/tutorial.html\n * how to contribute: https://anhaidgroup.github.io/py_stringmatching/v0.4.2/contributing.html\n * developer manual: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/py_stringmatching/v0.2.0/dev-manual-v0.2.0.pdf\n * issue tracker: https://github.com/anhaidgroup/py_stringmatching/issues\n * mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/py_stringmatching\n \ndependencies\n============\n\npy_stringmatching has been tested on each python version between 3.7 and 3.11, inclusive.\n\nthe required dependencies to build the package are numpy 1.7.0 or higher,\nsix, and a c or c++ compiler. for the development version, you will also need cython.\n\nplatforms\n=========\n\npy_stringmatching has been tested on linux, os x and windows. at this time we have only tested on x86 architecture.\n\n\n",
