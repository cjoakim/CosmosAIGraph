btreecontainer and\norderedcontainer, as well as the base class used by ``zope.site.folder``\nfor the folder implementation.\n\ndocumentation is hosted at https://zopecontainer.readthedocs.io\n\n\n=========\n changes\n=========\n\n5.2 (2023-10-05)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.12.\n\n\n5.1 (2023-04-24)\n================\n\n- drop using ``setup_requires`` due to constant problems on gha.\n\n- add preliminary support for python 3.12a7.\n\n\n5.0 (2023-01-24)\n================\n\n- build linux binary wheels for python 3.11.\n\n- drop support for python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\n\n4.10 (2022-11-17)\n=================\n\n- release to rebuild a full set of binary wheels.\n\n\n4.9 (2022-11-16)\n================\n\n- add support for building arm64 wheels on macos.\n\n4.8 (2022-11-06)\n================\n\n- add support for final python 3.11 release.\n\n\n4.7 (2022-09-15)\n================\n\n- disable unsafe math optimizations in c code.  see `pull request 46\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/pull/46>`_.\n\n\n4.6 (2022-07-14)\n================\n\n- add support for python 3.11 (as of 3.11.0b3).\n\n\n4.5.0 (2021-11-19)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.9 and 3.10.\n\n\n4.4.0 (2020-04-02)\n==================\n\n- support the ``pure_python`` environment variable at runtime instead\n  of just at wheel build time. a value of 0 forces the c extensions to\n  be used failing if they aren't present. any other value forces the\n  python implementation to be used, ignoring the c extensions.\n\n- drop support for the deprecated ``python setup.py test`` command.\n\n- ensure all objects have consistent interface resolution orders. this\n  may slightly change the order of interfaces for ``containedproxy``\n  objects. see `issue 34 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/34>`_.\n\n- stop including outdated versions of ``zope.proxy`` (implementation)\n  and ``persistent`` headers. instead, locate and use the installed\n  versions. see `issue 32\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/32>`_.\n\n  .. note::\n\n     this adds those two dependencies to ``setup_requires``.\n\n\n4.3.0 (2019-11-11)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.8.\n\n- drop support for python 3.4.\n\n\n4.2.2 (2018-08-10)\n==================\n\n- add a dependency on ``zope.cachedescriptors``, previously removed in\n  3.11. ``zope.cachedescriptors`` is a lightweight package, and the\n  copied code had diverged from the source. see\n  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/16\n\n- fix the possibility of a rare crash in the c extension when deallocating items. see\n  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/24\n\n- add support for python 3.7.\n\n\n4.2.1 (2017-08-02)\n==================\n\n- make ``orderedcontainer.updateorder`` normalize and store text keys\n  the same way that ``__setitem__`` does. fixes\n  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/21\n\n\n4.2.0 (2017-07-31)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.5 and 3.6.\n\n- drop support for python 2.6 and 3.3.\n\n- make ``orderedcontainer`` properly store the decoded text keys for\n  maintaining order instead of the raw bytes. also make it able to\n  accept raw bytes under python 3 in the first place. fixes\n  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/17\n\n- fix ``orderedcontainer`` becoming inconsistent if an event\n  subscriber threw an exception when adding an item. see\n  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/18\n\n- attain 100% test coverage. see\n  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/15\n\n- make the default ``namechooser`` always decode bytes using ascii instead of\n  whatever the current system codec happens to be.\n\n- make the default ``namechooser`` stop catching ``keyboardinterrupt``\n  and other ``baseexception`` types when it potentially calls\n  user-defined code to convert a name to a text string. instead, just\n  catch ``exception``.\n\n- respect the ``pure_python`` environment variable at runtime in\n  addition to build time. this makes it possible to use the\n  pure-python implementation of the container proxy on cpython for\n  ease of debugging. see https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/issues/13\n\n4.1.0 (2015-05-22)\n==================\n\n- make ``zope.container._proxy.pycontainedproxybase`` inherit\n  directly from ``zope.proxy.abstractproxybase`` as well as\n  ``persistent.persistent``, removing a bunch of redundant code, and\n  fixing bugs in interaction with pure-python persistence. see:\n  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.container/pull/4\n\n- add direct dependencies on ``zope.proxy`` and ``persistent`` since we\n  import from them; pin them to the versions needed for pure-python.\n\n- drop deprecated bbb imports module, ``zope.container.dependency``.\n\n4.0.0 (2014-03-19)\n==================\n\n- add support for python 3.4.\n\n- add support for pypy.\n\n\n4.0.0a3 (2013-02-28)\n====================\n\n- restore ``folder`` pickle forward/backward compatibility with\n  version 3.12.0 after making it inherit from ``btreecontainer.``\n\n\n4.0.0a2 (2013-02-21)\n====================\n\n- allow testing without checkouts of unreleased ``zope.publisher`` and\n  ``zodb``.\n\n- add python 3 trove classifiers.\n\n\n4.0.0a1 (2013-02-20)\n====================\n\n- add support for python 3.3.\n\n- make ``folder`` class inherit from ``btreecontainer`` class, so that the\n  icontainer interface does not need to be re-implemented. added a ``data``\n  attribute for bbb.\n\n- replace deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.\n\n- replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.\n\n- drop support for python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n- send ``icontainermodifiedevent`` *after* the container is modified\n  (lp#705600).\n\n- preserve the original exception traceback in\n  ``orderedcontainer.__setitem__``.\n\n- handle broken objects more gracefully\n\n- fix a bug that made it impossible to store none values in containers\n  (lp#1070719).\n\n\n3.12.0 (2010-12-14)\n===================\n\n- fix detection of moving folders into itself or a subfolder of itself.\n  (lp#118088)\n\n- fix zcml-related tests and dependencies.\n\n- add ``zcml`` extra dependencies.\n\n3.11.1 (2010-04-30)\n===================\n\n- prefer the standard libraries doctest module to the one from ``zope.testing``.\n\n- add compatibility with zodb3 3.10 by importing the ``ibroken`` interface\n  from it directly. once we can rely on the new zodb3 version exclusively,\n  we can remove the dependency onto the ``zope.broken`` distribution.\n\n- never fail if the suggested name is in a wrong type (#227617)\n\n- ``checkname`` first checks the parameter type before the emptiness.\n\n3.11.0 (2009-12-31)\n===================\n\n- copy two trivial classes from ``zope.cachedescriptors`` into this package,\n  which allows us to remove that dependency. we didn't actually use any\n  caching properties as the dependency suggested.\n\n3.10.1 (2009-12-29)\n===================\n\n- move ``zope.copypastemove`` related tests into that package.\n\n- remove no longer used zcml prefix from the configure file.\n\n- stop importing doctestsuite from ``zope.testing.doctestunit``. fixes\n  compatibility problems with ``zope.testing`` 3.8.4.\n\n3.10.0 (2009-12-15)\n===================\n\n- break testing dependency on ``zope.app.testing``.\n\n- break testing dependency on ``zope.app.dependable`` by moving the code and\n  tests into that package.\n\n- import ``isite`` from ``zope.component`` after it was moved there from\n  ``zope.location``.\n\n3.9.1 (2009-10-18)\n==================\n\n- rerelease 3.9.0 as it had a broken windows 2.6 egg.\n\n- mark this project as part of the ztk.\n\n3.9.0 (2009-08-28)\n==================\n\n- previous releases should be versioned 3.9.0 as they are not pure bugfix\n  releases and worth a \"feature\" release, increasing feature version.\n\n  packages that depend on any changes introduced in version 3.8.2 or 3.8.3\n  should depend on version 3.9 or greater.\n\n3.8.3 (2009-08-27)\n==================\n\n- move ``ixmlrpcpublisher`` zcml registrations for containers from\n  ``zope.app.publisher.xmlrpc`` to ``zope.container`` for now.\n\n3.8.2 (2009-05-17)\n==================\n\n- rid ourselves of ``icontained`` interface.  this interface was moved\n  to ``zope.location.interfaces``.  a b/w compat import still exists\n  to keep old code running.  depend on ``zope.location``>=3.5.4.\n\n- rid ourselves of the implementations of ``iobjectmovedevent``,\n  ``iobjectaddedevent``, ``iobjectremovedevent`` interfaces and\n  ``objectmovedevent``, ``objectaddedevent`` and\n  ``objectremovedevent`` classes.  b/w compat imports still exist.\n  all of these were moved to ``zope.lifecycleevent``. depend on\n  ``zope.lifecycleevent``>=3.5.2.\n\n- fix a bug in ``orderedcontainer`` where trying to set the value for a\n  key that already exists (duplication error) would actually delete the\n  key from the order, leaving a dangling reference.\n\n- partially break dependency on ``zope.traversing`` by disusing\n  ``zope.traversing.api.getpath`` in favor of using\n  ``ilocationinfo(object).getpath()``.  the rest of the runtime\n  dependencies on ``zope.traversing`` are currently interface\n  dependencies.\n\n- break runtime dependency on ``zope.app.dependable`` by using a zcml\n  condition on the subscriber zcml directive that registers the\n  ``checkdependency`` handler for ``iobjectremovedevent``.  if\n  ``zope.app.dependable`` is not installed, this subscriber will never\n  be registered.  ``zope.app.dependable`` is now a testing dependency\n  only.\n\n3.8.1 (2009-04-03)\n==================\n\n- fix misspackaged 3.8.0\n\n\n3.8.0 (2009-04-03)\n==================\n\n- change ``configure.zcml`` to not depend on ``zope.app.component``.\n  fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/348329\n\n- move the declaration of ``iorderedcontainer.updateorder``  to a new, basic\n  ``iordered`` interface and let ``iorderedcontainer`` inherit it. this allows\n  easier reuse of the declaration.\n\n3.7.2 (2009-03-12)\n==================\n\n- fix: added missing ``componentlookuperror``, missing since revision 95429\n  and missing in last release.\n\n- adapt to the move of idefaultviewname from ``zope.component.interfaces``\n  to ``zope.publisher.interfaces``.\n\n- add support for reserved names for containers. to specify reserved\n  names for some container, you need to provide an adapter from the\n  container to the ``zope.container.interfaces.ireservednames`` interface.\n  the default ``namechooser`` is now also aware of reserved names.\n\n3.7.1 (2009-02-05)\n==================\n\n- raise more \"pythonic\" errors from ``__setitem__``, losing the dependency\n  on ``zope.exceptions``:\n\n  o ``zope.exceptions.duplicationerror`` -> ``keyerror``\n\n  o ``zope.exceptions.usererror`` -> ``valueerror``\n\n- move import of ``ibroken`` interface to use new ``zope.broken``\n  package, which has no dependencies beyond ``zope.interface``.\n\n- make ``test`` part pull in the extra test requirements of this package.\n\n- split the ``z3c.recipe.compattest`` configuration out into a new file,\n  ``compat.cfg``, to reduce the burden of doing standard unit tests.\n\n- strip out bogus develop eggs from ``buildout.cfg``.\n\n3.7.0 (2009-01-31)\n==================\n\n- split this package off ``zope.app.container``. this package is\n  intended to have far less dependencies than ``zope.app.container``.\n\n- this package also contains the container implementation that\n  used to be in ``zope.app.folder``.\n",
