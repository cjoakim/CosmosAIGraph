  "description": "# pysigma\n\n![tests](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)\n![coverage badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thomaspatzke/11b31b4f709b6dc54a30d5203e8fe0ee/raw/sigmahq-pysigma-coverage.json)\n![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pre--release-orange)\n\n`pysigma` is a python library that parses and converts sigma rules into queries. it is a replacement\nfor the legacy sigma toolchain (sigmac) with a much cleaner design and is almost fully tested.\nbackends for support of conversion into query languages and processing pipelines for transforming\nrule for log data models are separated into dedicated projects to keep pysigma itself slim and\nvendor-agnostic. see the *related projects* section below to get an overview.\n\n## getting started\n\nto start using `pysigma`, install it using your python package manager of choice. examples:\n\n```\npip install pysigma\npipenv install pysigma\npoetry add pysigma\n```\n\ndocumentation with some usage examples can be found [here](https://sigmahq-pysigma.readthedocs.io/).\n\n## autodiscovery and migration of backend plugins\n\npreviously, in order to export the objects (backends, pipelines, and validators) of the plugin, it was required to manually export them using global variables in the `__init__.py` file of the corresponding module. however, this manual export is no longer necessary as pysigma now employs a better mechanism for autodiscovery to locate the exported objects. consequently, the use of global variables becomes redundant and can be eliminated. nevertheless, to ensure compatibility with older versions of pysigma and sigma-cli, support for global variables will be retained for the time being. however, it is important to note that in a future release of pysigma, the global variables will be completely phased out.\n\n## pipeline changes after v0.9.11\n\nin the previous implementation, pipelines were defined as functions that returned a `processingpipeline` object. however, this approach presented a challenge for autodiscovery because the functions lacked type hints, making it difficult to determine their return type. to address this issue, a global variable named `pipelines` was introduced in the `__init__.py` file of the plugin's pipeline module. while this workaround allowed the user to manually export the pipeline functions, it was not an ideal solution.\n\nfollowing discussions [here](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma/discussions/110#discussioncomment-6179682), a decision was made to introduce a class decorator that could be applied to the pipeline functions. this decorator serves two purposes: it allows the functions to be treated as pipeline objects and provides a convenient way for autodiscovery to locate them. additionally, this approach enables a gradual migration from pipeline functions to pipeline classes without breaking backward compatibility.\n\nby adopting this decorator-based approach, the need for global variables and manual exporting is eliminated. it simplifies the autodiscovery process and enhances code organization. it is important to note that while the previous approach of using global variables will be supported for the time being, it will eventually be phased out in a future release of pysigma.\n\nhere is the revised example illustrating the use of the class decorator:\n\n```python\nfrom sigma.pipelines.base import pipeline\n\n@pipeline\ndef pipeline_1():\n    return processingpipeline(\n        ... # pipeline code goes here\n    )\n\n\nclass pipeline_2(pipeline):\n    def apply(self):\n        return processingpipeline(\n            ... # pipeline code goes here\n        )\n```\n\nboth pipelines can still be used in the same manner as before. there is no difference between the two approaches because the `pipeline_2` class can be instantiated and used as a pipeline object, like `pipeline_2()()` or `pipeline_2().apply()`. in other words, when the class is instantiated, an object of the `pipeline` class is returned. calling the object itself will automatically run the `apply` method, which returns a `processingpipeline` object. this behavior aligns with the functionality of the `pipeline_1` function, which also returns a `processingpipeline` object. this consistency results in a cleaner and more streamlined approach for autodiscovery and facilitates the gradual migration of pipeline functions to classes.\n\n### pysigma before v0.9.11\n\nthe backend plugin [autodiscovery](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma/blob/800c3e1be3670bab39767fd19d6d7fdd3effb8e6/sigma/plugins.py#l61) functionality has been added, eliminating the need for manual registration of plugins in [sigma-cli](https://github.com/sigmahq/sigma-cli). however, some backends may not function with the updated sigma-cli version. to address this issue, plugin developers should make the following changes to their backends:\n\n1. in the `sigma/backends/my_awesome_backend/__init__.py` file, add a `backends` global variable that references the backend class:\n\n    ```python\n    from .my_awesome_backend import myawesomebackend\n\n    backends = {\n        \"my_awesome_backend\": myawesomebackend,\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. in the `sigma/pipelines/my_awesome_pipelines/__init__.py` file, add a `pipelines` global variable that lists the available pipelines:\n\n    ```python\n    from .my_awesome_pipelines import pipeline_1, pipeline_2\n\n    pipelines = {\n        \"pipeline_1\": pipeline_1,\n        \"pipeline_2\": pipeline_2,\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. (optional) if your backend has [validators](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma/tree/main/sigma/validators) (used with `sigma check`): in the `sigma/pipelines/my_awesome_validators/__init__.py` file, add a `validators` global variable that lists the available pipelines:\n\n    ```python\n    validators = {\n        \"validator_1\": myfirstvalidator,\n        \"validator_2\": mysecondvalidator,\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. finally, submit a pull request to the [pysigma-plugin-directory](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma-plugin-directory/blob/main/pysigma-plugins-v1.json) and update the version compatibility of your backend plugin with pysigma.\n\nby following these steps, your backend plugin will be compatible with newer versions of pysigma and sigma-cli, allowing for autodiscovery and migration of backend plugins.\n\n## create your own backend for pysigma\n\nthe creation of a backend has become much easier with pysigma. we recommend using the \"cookie cutter template\" and reviewing the existing backends listed in the \"related projects\" section of this readme.\n\n[pysigma cookie cutter template](https://github.com/sigmahq/cookiecutter-pysigma-backend)\n\n## features\n\n`pysigma` brings a number of additional features compared to `sigmac`, as well as some changes.\n\n### modifier comparison between pysigma and sigmac\n\n| modifier     | use

|\n\n## overview\n\nconversion overview\n\n![conversion graph](/docs/images/conversion.png)\n\npipelines\n\n![conversion graph](/docs/images/pipelines.png)\n\nmore details are described in [the documentation](https://sigmahq-pysigma.readthedocs.io/).\n\n## testing\n\npysigma uses pytest as testing framework. simply run `pytest` to run all tests. run `pytest\n--cov=sigma` to get a coverage report.\n\n## building\n\nto build your own package run `poetry build`.\n\n## linting\n\nto lint the code run `poetry run black`. to check for linting errors run `poetry run black --check`.\n\nthis project also uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), which is installed by poetry as part of dev dependencies. to install the git hooks run `poetry run pre-commit install` after cloning the repository and installing the dependencies.\n\n## contributing\n\npull requests are welcome. please feel free to lodge any issues/prs as discussion points.\n\nthis [blog post](https://medium.com/@micahbabinski/creating-a-sigma-backend-for-fun-and-no-profit-ed16d20da142) by micah babinski explains the process from a developer's perspective.\n\n## maintainers\n\nthe project is currently maintained by:\n\n- thomas patzke <thomas@patzke.org>\n- [fran\u00e7ois hubaut](https://github.com/frack113)\n\n## related projects\n\npysigma isn't a monolithic library attempting to support everything but the core. support for target\nquery languages and log data models is provided by additional packages that extend pysigma:\n\n* [sigma-cli](https://github.com/sigmahq/sigma-cli): a command line interface for conversion of\n  sigma rules based on pysigma.\n* [pysigma-backend-splunk](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma-backend-splunk)\n* [pysigma-pipeline-sysmon](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma-pipeline-sysmon)\n* [pysigma-pipeline-crowdstrike](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma-pipeline-crowdstrike)\n\nall packages can also be installed from pypi if not mentioned otherwise by the python package\nmanager of your choice.\n\n## license\n\ngnu lesser general public license v2.1. for details, please see the full license file [located here](https://github.com/sigmahq/pysigma/blob/main/license).\n\n",
