  "description": "mujoco physics simulator\n# mujoco python bindings\n\n[![pypi python version][pypi-versions-badge]][pypi]\n[![pypi version][pypi-badge]][pypi]\n\n[pypi-versions-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mujoco\n[pypi-badge]: https://badge.fury.io/py/mujoco.svg\n[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/mujoco/\n\nthis package is the canonical python bindings for the\n[mujoco physics engine](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco).\nthese bindings are developed and maintained by google deepmind, and is kept\nup-to-date with the latest developments in mujoco itself.\n\nthe `mujoco` package provides direct access to raw mujoco c api functions,\nstructs, constants, and enumerations. structs are provided as python classes,\nwith pythonic initialization and deletion semantics.\n\nit is not the aim of this package to provide fully fledged\nscene/environment/game authoring api, as there are already a number of existing\npackages that do this well. however, this package does provide a number of\nlower-level components outside of mujoco itself that are likely to be useful to\nmost users who access mujoco through python. for example, the `egl`, `glfw`, and\n`osmesa` subpackages contain utilities for setting up opengl rendering contexts.\n\n## installation\n\nthe recommended way to install this package is via [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mujoco/):\n\n```sh\npip install mujoco\n```\n\na copy of the mujoco library is provided as part of the package and does **not**\nneed to be downloaded or installed separately.\n\n### source\n\n**important:** building from source is only necessary if you are modifying the\npython bindings (or are trying to run on exceptionally old linux systems).\nif that's not the case, then we recommend installing the prebuilt binaries from\npypi.\n\nif you need to build the python bindings from source, please consult\n[the documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html#building-from-source).\n\n## usage\n\nonce installed, the package can be imported via `import mujoco`. please consult\nour [documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python.html) for\nfurther detail on the package's api.\n\nwe recommend going through the tutorial notebook which covers the basics of\nmujoco using python:\n[![open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb)\n\n## versioning\n\nthe `major.minor.micro` portion of the version number matches the version of\nmujoco that the bindings provide. optionally, if we release updates to the\npython bindings themselves that target the same version of mujoco, a `.postn`\nsuffix is added, for example `2.1.2.post2` represents the second update to the\nbindings for mujoco 2.1.2.\n\n## license and disclaimer\n\ncopyright 2022

limitations on grant scope\n\nthe licenses granted in this section 2 are the only rights granted under\nthis license. no additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of covered software under this license.\nnotwithstanding section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\ncontributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a contributor has removed from covered software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) your and any other third party's\n    modifications of covered software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    contributions with other software (except as part of its contributor\n    version); or\n\n(c) under patent claims infringed by covered software in the absence of\n    its contributions.\n\nthis license does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in section 3.4).\n\n2.4. subsequent licenses\n\nno contributor makes additional grants as a result of your choice to\ndistribute the covered software under a subsequent version of this\nlicense (see section 10.2) or under the terms of a secondary license (if\npermitted

distribution of source form\n\nall distribution of covered software in source code form, including any\nmodifications that you create or to which you contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this license. you must inform recipients that the source\ncode form of the covered software is governed by the terms of this\nlicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this license. you may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the source code\nform.\n\n3.2. distribution of executable form\n\nif you distribute covered software in executable form then:\n\n(a) such covered software must also be made available in source code\n    form, as described in section 3.1, and you must inform recipients of\n    the executable form how they can obtain a copy of such source code\n    form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) you may distribute such executable form under the terms of this\n    license, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the executable form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the source code form under this license.\n\n3.3. distribution of a larger work\n\nyou may create and distribute a larger work under terms of your choice,\nprovided that you also comply with the requirements of this license for\nthe covered software. if the larger work is a combination of covered\nsoftware with a work governed by one or more secondary licenses, and the\ncovered software is not incompatible with secondary licenses, this\nlicense permits you to additionally distribute such covered software\nunder the terms of such secondary license(s), so that the recipient of\nthe larger work may, at their option, further distribute the covered\nsoftware under the terms of either this license or such secondary\nlicense(s).\n\n3.4. notices\n\nyou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the source code form of\nthe covered software, except that you may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. application of additional terms\n\nyou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of covered\nsoftware. however, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any contributor. you must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nyou alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify every contributor for any\nliability incurred by such contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms you offer. you may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. inability to comply due to statute or regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nif it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this\nlicense with respect to some or all of the covered software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then you must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this license to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the covered\nsoftware under this license. except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. the rights granted under this license will terminate automatically\nif you fail to comply with any of its terms. however, if you become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this license from a particular\ncontributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\ncontributor explicitly and finally terminates your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such contributor fails to notify you of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after you have\ncome back into compliance. moreover, your grants from a particular\ncontributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such contributor\nnotifies you of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time you have received notice of non-compliance with this license\nfrom such contributor, and you become compliant prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. if you initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a contributor version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nyou by any and all contributors for the covered software under section\n2.1 of this license shall terminate.\n\n5.3. in the event of termination under sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by you or your distributors under this license\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6. disclaimer of warranty
