  "description": ".. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/mark-adams/pytest-test-groups.png?branch=master\n   :alt: build status\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/mark-adams/pytest-test-groups\n\nwelcome to pytest-test-groups!\n==============================\n\npytest-test-groups allows you to split your test runs into groups of a specific\nsize to make it easier to split up your test runs.\n\n\nusage\n---------------------\n\n::\n\n    # install pytest-test-groups\n    pip install pytest-test-groups\n\n    # split the tests into 10 groups and run the second group\n    py.test --test-group-count 10 --test-group=2\n    \n    # randomize the test order, split into 10 groups, and run the second group\n    py.test --test-group-count 10 --test-group=2 --test-group-random-seed=12345\n\n\nwhy would i use this?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nsometimes you may have some long running test jobs that take a\nwhile to complete. this can be a major headache when trying to\nrun tests quickly. pytest-test-groups allows you to easily say\n\"split my tests into groups of 10 tests and run the second group\".\nthis is primarily useful in the context of ci builds.\n",
