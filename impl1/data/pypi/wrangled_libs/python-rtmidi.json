  "description": "# welcome to python-rtmidi!\n\na python binding for the rtmidi c++ library implemented using cython.\n\n[![latest version](https://shields.io/pypi/v/python-rtmidi)](https://pypi.org/project/python-rtmidi)\n![project status](https://shields.io/pypi/status/python-rtmidi)\n[![mit license](https://shields.io/pypi/l/python-rtmidi)](license.md)\n![python versions](https://shields.io/pypi/pyversions/python-rtmidi)\n[![distribution format](https://shields.io/pypi/format/python-rtmidi)](https://pypi.org/project/python-rtmidi/#files)\n[![ci status](https://github.com/spotlightkid/python-rtmidi/actions/workflows/push_to_master.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spotlightkid/python-rtmidi/actions)\n\n# overview\n\n[rtmidi] is a set of c++ classes which provides a concise and simple,\ncross-platform api (application programming interface) for realtime midi\ninput / output across linux (alsa & jack), macos / os x (coremidi & jack), and\nwindows (multimedia system) operating systems.\n\n[python-rtmidi] is a python binding for rtmidi implemented using [cython] and\nprovides a thin wrapper around the rtmidi c++ interface. the api is basically\nthe same as the c++ one but with the naming scheme of classes, methods and\nparameters adapted to the python pep-8 conventions and requirements of the\npython package naming structure. **python-rtmidi** supports python 3 (3.8+).\n\nthe [documentation] provides installation instructions, a history of changes\nper release and an api reference.\n\nsee the file [license.md] about copyright and usage terms.\n\nthe source code repository and issue tracker are hosted on github:\n\n<https://github.com/spotlightkid/python-rtmidi>.\n\n## usage example\n\nhere's a quick example of how to use **python-rtmidi** to open the first\navailable midi output port and send a middle c note on midi channel 1:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport rtmidi\n\nmidiout = rtmidi.midiout()\navailable_ports = midiout.get_ports()\n\nif available_ports:\n    midiout.open_port(0)\nelse:\n    midiout.open_virtual_port(\"my virtual output\")\n\nwith midiout:\n    note_on = [0x90, 60, 112] # channel 1, middle c, velocity 112\n    note_off = [0x80, 60, 0]\n    midiout.send_message(note_on)\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    midiout.send_message(note_off)\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n\ndel midiout\n```\n\nmore usage examples can be found in the [examples] and [tests] directories of\nthe source repository.\n\n\n[cython]: http://cython.org/\n[documentation]: https://spotlightkid.github.io/python-rtmidi/\n[examples]: https://github.com/spotlightkid/python-rtmidi/tree/master/examples\n[license.md]: https://github.com/spotlightkid/python-rtmidi/blob/master/license.md\n[python-rtmidi]: https://github.com/spotlightkid/python-rtmidi\n[tests]: https://github.com/spotlightkid/python-rtmidi/tree/master/tests\n[rtmidi]: http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/index.html\n",
