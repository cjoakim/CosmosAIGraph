  "description": "python package aeidon for subtitles\n===================================\n\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aeidon.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/aeidon/)\n[![downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/aeidon/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/aeidon)\n\naeidon is a python package that provides classes and functions for\ndealing with text-based subtitle files of many different formats.\nfunctions exist for reading and writing subtitle files as well as\nmanipulating subtitle data, i.e. positions (times or frames) and texts.\n\n## installation\n\nthe latest stable release is available via pypi.\n\n```bash\npip install -u aeidon\n```\n\n## documentation\n\nhttps://otsaloma.io/gaupol/doc/api/aeidon.html\n\n## distro-packaging\n\nwhen packaging both aeidon and gaupol in a linux distro, it's best to\nuse the switches in the main `setup.py` for a consistent whole.\n\n    sudo python3 setup.py --without-gaupol install --prefix=/usr/local\n    sudo python3 setup.py --without-aeidon install --prefix=/usr/local\n\nnote that the `--with-*` and `--without-*` are global options and must\nbe placed before any commands.\n\nof the dependencies listed in the [`readme.md`](readme.md) file,\niso-codes and chardet are to be associated with aeidon. if aeidon is\ninstalled using the `--without-iso-codes` switch, then iso-codes is\nrequired instead of optional. gaupol should depend on the remaining\ndependencies as well as aeidon of the same version.\n\n## history\n\nthe aeidon package is part of the gaupol subtitle editor, where the\nother package, gaupol, provides the gtk user interface.\n\nseparating a user interface independent general-purpose subtitle editing\npackage from gaupol has been an afterthought and thus not well designed\nto be a reusable component, but on the other hand is proven, working and\nmaintained code.\n",
