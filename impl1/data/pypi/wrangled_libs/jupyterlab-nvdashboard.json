  "description": "# jupyterlab nvdashboard\n\n![gpu dashboard](demo.gif)\n\n![github actions status](https://github.com/rapidsai/jupyterlab-nvdashboard/workflows/build/badge.svg)\n\nnvdashboard is a jupyterlab extension for displaying gpu usage dashboards. it enables jupyterlab users to visualize system hardware metrics within the same interactive environment they use for development. supported metrics include:\n\n- gpu-compute utilization\n- gpu-memory consumption\n- pcie throughput\n- nvlink throughput\n\n\nthis extension is composed of a python package named `jupyterlab_nvdashboard`\nfor the server extension and a npm package named `jupyterlab-nvdashboard`\nfor the frontend extension.\n\n\n## requirements\n\n* jupyterlab >= 3.0\n\n## install\n\n```bash\npip install jupyterlab_nvdashboard\n```\n\n\n## troubleshoot\n\nif you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check\nthat the server extension is enabled:\n\n```bash\njupyter server extension list\n```\n\nif the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing\nthe frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension list\n```\n\n\n## contributing\n\n### development install\n\nnote: you will need nodejs to build the extension package.\n\nthe `jlpm` command is jupyterlab's pinned version of\n[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with jupyterlab. you may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# clone the repo to your local environment\n# change directory to the jupyterlab_nvdashboard directory\n# install package in development mode\npip install -e .\n# link your development version of the extension with jupyterlab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n# rebuild extension typescript source after making changes\njlpm run build\n```\n\nyou can watch the source directory and run jupyterlab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm run watch\n# run jupyterlab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nwith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running jupyterlab. refresh jupyterlab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\nby default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. to also generate source maps for the jupyterlab core extensions, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab build --minimize=false\n```\n\n### uninstall\n\n```bash\npip uninstall jupyterlab_nvdashboard\n```\n\nreleases for both packages are handled by [gpuci](https://gpuci.gpuopenanalytics.com/job/rapidsai/job/gpuci/job/jupyterlab-nvdashboard/). nightly builds are triggered when a push to a versioned branch occurs (i.e. `branch-0.5`). stable builds are triggered when a push to the `main` branch occurs.\n",
