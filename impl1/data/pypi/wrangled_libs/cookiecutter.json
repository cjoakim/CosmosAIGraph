swiftly from **cookiecutters** (project templates) with this command-line utility. ideal for generating python package projects and more.\n\n- [documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io)\n- [github](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)\n- [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/)\n- [license (bsd)](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/blob/main/license)\n\n## installation\n\ninstall cookiecutter using pip package manager:\n```\n# pipx is strongly recommended.\npipx install cookiecutter\n\n# if pipx is not an option,\n# you can install cookiecutter in your python user directory.\npython -m pip install --user cookiecutter\n```\n\n## features\n\n- **cross-platform:** supports windows, mac, and linux.\n- **user-friendly:** no python knowledge required.\n- **versatile:** compatible with python 3.7 to 3.11.\n- **multi-language support:** use templates in any language or markup format.\n\n### for users\n\n#### quick start\n\nthe recommended way to use cookiecutter as a command line utility is to run it with [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), which can be installed with `pip install pipx`, but if you plan to use cookiecutter programmatically, please run `pip install cookiecutter`.\n\n**use a github template**\n\n```bash\n# you'll be prompted to enter values.\n# then it'll create your python package in the current working directory,\n# based on those values.\n# for the sake of brevity, repos on github can just use the 'gh' prefix\n$ pipx run cookiecutter gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage\n```\n\n**use a local template**\n\n```bash\n$ pipx run cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/\n```\n\n**use it from python**\n\n```py\nfrom cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter\n\n# create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template\ncookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')\n\n# create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template\ncookiecutter('gh:audreyfeldroy//cookiecutter-pypackage.git')\n```\n\n#### detailed usage\n\n- generate projects from local or remote templates.\n- customize projects with `cookiecutter.json` prompts.\n- utilize pre-prompt, pre- and post-generate hooks.\n\n[learn more](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)\n\n### for template creators\n\n- utilize unlimited directory nesting.\n- employ jinja2 for all templating needs.\n- define template variables easily with `cookiecutter.json`.\n\n[learn more](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/)\n\n##
