  "description": "## microsoft azure sdk for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure deployment manager client library.\n\nazure resource manager (arm) is the next generation of management apis\nthat replace the old azure service management (asm).\n\nthis package has been tested with python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.\n\nfor the older azure service management (asm) libraries, see\n[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)\nlibrary.\n\nfor a more complete set of azure libraries, see the\n[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).\n\n## usage\n\n\nto learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)\n\n\n\nfor docs and references, see [python sdk references](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)\ncode samples for this package can be found at [deployment manager management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=getting%20started%20-%20managing&terms=getting%20started%20-%20managing) on docs.microsoft.com.\nadditional code samples for different azure services are available at [samples repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)\n\n\n## provide feedback\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in\nthe [issues](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project.\n\n![image](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fazure-mgmt-deploymentmanager%2freadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 1.0.0 (2021-05-20)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model rolloutpropertiesautogenerated has a new parameter artifact_source_id\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - operation stepsoperations.list has a new signature\n  - operation servicesoperations.list has a new signature\n  -

operation servicetopologiesoperations.delete has a new signature\n\n## 1.0.0b1 (2020-11-30)\n\nthis is beta preview version.\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\n- credential system has been completly revamped:\n\n  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\n  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`\n\n- the `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. example: `myclient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=true)`. for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n- you can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead\n- operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.lropoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.lropoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.\n- exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror` (`clouderror` has been removed).\n- most of the operation kwarg have changed. some of the most noticeable:\n\n  - `raw` has been removed. equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal http response for advanced user\n  - for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n\n**general new features**\n\n- type annotations support using `typing`. sdks are mypy ready.\n- this client has now stable and official support for async. check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.\n- this client now support natively tracing library like opencensus or opentelemetry. see this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.\n\n## 0.2.0 (2019-12-31)\n\n**features**\n\n  - added operation serviceunitsoperations.list\n  - added operation rolloutsoperations.list\n  - added operation artifactsourcesoperations.list\n  - added operation servicetopologiesoperations.list\n  - added operation stepsoperations.list\n  - added operation servicesoperations.list\n  - added operation operations.list\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - parameter attributes of model waitstepproperties is now required\n  - removed operation operations.get\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that might introduce\nbreaking changes if from some import. in summary, some modules were\nincorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. this fixed several\nissues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in\nthe first place. deploymentmanagerclient cannot be imported from\nazure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.deployment_manager_client anymore (import\nfrom azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager works like before)\ndeploymentmanagerclientconfiguration import has been moved from\nazure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.deployment_manager_client to\nazure.mgmt.deploymentmanager a model myclass from a \"models\" sub-module\ncannot be imported anymore using\nazure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.models.my_class (import from\nazure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.models works like before) an operation\nclass myclassoperations from an operations sub-module cannot be imported\nanymore using\nazure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.operations.my_class_operations (import\nfrom azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.operations works like before) last but\nnot least, http connection pooling is now enabled by default. you should\nalways use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or use no\nmore than one client per process.\n\n## 0.1.0 (2019-04-15)\n\n  - initial release\n\n\n",
