  "description": "# <img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/theupdateframework/artwork/3a649fa6/tuf-logo.svg\" height=\"100\" valign=\"middle\" alt=\"tuf\"/> a framework for securing software update systems\n\n![build](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)\n[![coveralls](https://coveralls.io/repos/theupdateframework/python-tuf/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/r/theupdateframework/python-tuf?branch=develop)\n[![docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/theupdateframework/badge/)](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/)\n[![cii](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1351/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1351)\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tuf)](https://pypi.org/project/tuf/)\n[![openssf scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/badge)](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf)\n\n----------------------------\n[the update framework (tuf)](https://theupdateframework.io/) is a framework for\nsecure content delivery and updates. it protects against various types of\nsupply chain attacks and provides resilience to compromise. this repository is a\n**reference implementation** written in python. it is intended to conform to\nversion 1.0 of the [tuf\nspecification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/).\n\npython-tuf provides the following apis:\n  * [`tuf.api.metadata`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.api.html),\n    a \"low-level\" api, designed to provide easy and safe access to tuf\n    metadata and to handle (de)serialization from/to files.\n  * [`tuf.ngclient`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.ngclient.html),\n    a client implementation built on top of the metadata api.\n  * `tuf.repository`, a repository library also built on top of the metadata\n    api. this module is currently not considered part of python-tuf stable api.\n\nthe reference implementation strives to be a readable guide and demonstration\nfor those working on implementing tuf in their own languages, environments, or\nupdate systems.\n\n\nabout the update framework\n--------------------------\nthe update framework (tuf) design helps developers maintain the security of a\nsoftware update system, even against attackers that compromise the repository\nor signing keys.\ntuf provides a flexible\n[specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md)\ndefining functionality that developers can use in any software update system or\nre-implement to fit their needs.\n\ntuf is hosted by the [linux foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as\npart of the [cloud native computing foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (cncf)\nand its design is [used in production](https://theupdateframework.io/adoptions/)\nby various tech companies and open source organizations. a variant of tuf\ncalled [uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is used to secure over-the-air\nupdates in automobiles.\n\nplease see [tuf's website](https://theupdateframework.com/) for more information about tuf!\n\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n* [introduction to tuf's design](https://theupdateframework.io/overview/)\n* [the tuf specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/)\n* [developer documentation](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/), including\n  [api reference](\n    https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api-reference.html)\n* [usage

channel on [cncf\nslack](https://slack.cncf.io/).\n\nwe strive to make the specification easy to implement, so if you come across\nany inconsistencies or experience any difficulty, do let us know by sending an\nemail, or by reporting an issue in the github [specification\nrepo](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues).\n\nsecurity issues and
