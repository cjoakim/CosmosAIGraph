  "description": "# setuptools_scm\n[![github ci](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/workflows/python%20tests+artifacts+release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/actions)\n[![documentation status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/setuptools-scm/badge/?version=latest)](https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n[![tidelift](https://tidelift.com/badges/package/pypi/setuptools-scm) ](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-setuptools-scm?utm_source=pypi-setuptools-scm&utm_medium=readme)\n\n## about\n\n[setuptools-scm] extracts python package versions from `git` or\n`hg` metadata instead of declaring them as the version argument\nor in an scm managed file.\n\nadditionally, [setuptools-scm] provides setuptools\nwith a list of files that are managed by the scm <br/>\n(i.e. it automatically adds **all of** the scm-managed files to the sdist).<br/>\nunwanted files must be excluded via `manifest.in`.\n\n\n## `pyproject.toml` usage\n\nthe preferred way to configure [setuptools-scm] is to author\nsettings in a `tool.setuptools_scm` section of `pyproject.toml`.\n\nthis feature requires setuptools 60 or later.\nfirst, ensure that [setuptools-scm] is present during the project's\nbuild step by specifying it as one of the build requirements.\n\n```toml\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\n    \"setuptools>=60\",\n    \"setuptools-scm>=8.0\"]\n```\n\nthat will be sufficient to require [setuptools-scm] for projects\nthat support [pep 518] like [pip] and [build].\n\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip\n[build]: https://pypi.org/project/build\n[pep 518]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/\n\n\nto enable version inference, you need to set the version\ndynamically in the `project` section of `pyproject.toml`:\n\n```toml title=\"pyproject.toml\"\n[project]\n# version = \"0.0.1\"  # remove any existing version parameter.\ndynamic = [\"version\"]\n[tool.setuptools_scm]\n```\n\nadditionally, a version file can be written by specifying:\n\n```toml title=\"pyproject.toml\"\n[tool.setuptools_scm]\nversion_file = \"pkg/_version.py\"\n```\n\nwhere `pkg` is the name of your package.\n\nif you need to confirm which version string is being generated or debug the configuration,\nyou can install [setuptools-scm] directly in your working environment and run:\n\n```console\n$ python -m setuptools_scm\n# to explore other options, try:\n$ python -m setuptools_scm --help\n```\n\nfor further configuration see the [documentation].\n\n[setuptools-scm]: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm\n[documentation]: https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/\n\n\n## interaction with enterprise distributions\n\nsome enterprise distributions like rhel7\nship rather old setuptools versions.\n\nin those cases its typically possible to build by using an sdist against `setuptools_scm<2.0`.\nas those old setuptools versions lack sensible types for versions,\nmodern [setuptools-scm] is unable to support them sensibly.\n\nit's strongly recommended to build a wheel artifact using modern python and setuptools,\nthen installing the artifact instead of trying to run against old setuptools versions.\n\n\n## code of conduct\n\n\neveryone interacting in the [setuptools-scm] project's codebases, issue\ntrackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the\n[psf code of conduct].\n\n[psf code of conduct]: https://github.com/pypa/.github/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md\n\n\n## security contact\n\nto report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).\ntidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.\n",
