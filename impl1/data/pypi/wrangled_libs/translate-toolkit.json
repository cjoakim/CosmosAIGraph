:alt: license\n\nthe translate toolkit is a set of software and documentation designed to help\nmake the lives of localizers both more productive and less frustrating.  the\ntoolkit is part of the translate project, hosted at\n<https://github.com/translate>.\n\nthe software includes programs to convert localization formats to the common\npo, and emerging xliff format.  there are also programs to check and manage po\nand xliff files.  online documentation includes guides on using the tools,\nrunning a localization project and how to localize various projects from\nopenoffice.org to mozilla.\n\nat its core the software contains a set of classes for handling various\nlocalization storage formats: dtd, properties, openoffice.org gsi/sdf,\ncsv, mo, qt .ts, tmx, tbx, wordfast txt, gettext .mo, windows rc, and\nof course po and xliff.  it also provides scripts to convert between\nthese formats.\n\nalso part of the toolkit are python programs to create word counts, merge\ntranslations and perform various checks on translation files.\n\n\nimportant links\n---------------\n\n* `latest release downloads <https://github.com/translate/translate/releases>`_\n* `documentation\n  <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/>`_,\n  also use ``--help`` with any of the commands.\n* the translate toolkit is released under the `gpl\n  <https://github.com/translate/translate/blob/master/copying>`_ with\n  `contributions from many people\n  <https://github.com/translate/translate/blob/master/credits>`_.\n* `reporting issues <https://github.com/translate/translate/issues>`_\n* `installation <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/stable/installation.html>`_\n\n\njoining the translate project\n-----------------------------\nif you would like to join the translate project mailing list then visit:\n<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translate-devel>.\n\nthe vision of the translate project is to be a meta project for localizers\nbuilt on the premise that your language deserves to be a project on its own\nright not a poor cousin of the main project.\n\nmost projects are inattentive to the needs and difficulties experienced by\nlocalizers. to that end the aim is to work towards creating tools and\ndocumentation that allows localizers to focus on what they do best: translating\nsoftware.\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\nthere are several extra requirements which you might to install to get full\nfeature set. this cal be easily specified during pip installation::\n\n    # install with xml support\n    pip install translate-toolkit[xml]\n\n    # install all optional dependencies\n    pip install translate-toolkit[all]\n\n.. note:: please check ``requirements/*.txt``::\n\n       pip install -r requirements/optional.txt\n\n   will install all optional dependencies convering support for many other\n   formats.\n\nthe toolkit requires python 3.8 or newer.\n\nthe package lxml is required. you should install version 4.6.3 or later.\n<http://lxml.de/> depending on your platform, the easiest way to install might\nbe through your system's package management. alternatively you can try ::\n\n    pip install lxml\n\nwhich should install the newest version from the web.\n\nfor mac osx, the following pages might be of help:\n<http://lxml.de/build.html#building-lxml-on-macos-x>\n<http://lxml.de/installation.html#macos-x>\n\nthe package lxml has dependencies on libxml2 and libxslt. please check the lxml\nsite for the recommended versions of these libraries if you need to install\nthem separately at all. most packaged versions of lxml will already contain\nthese dependencies.\n\nwhen the environment variable usecpo is set to 1, the toolkit will attempt to\nuse libgettextpo from the gettext-tools package (it might have a slightly\ndifferent name on your distribution). this can greatly speed up access to po\nfiles, but has not yet been tested as extensively. feedback is most welcome.\n\nthe package iniparse is necessary for ini2po and po2ini:\n<https://pypi.org/project/iniparse/>\n\nthe python-levenshtein package will improve performance for fuzzy matching if\nit is available. this can improve the performance of pot2po, for example.  it\nis optional and no functionality is lost if it is not installed, only speed.\n<http://sourceforge.net/projects/translate/files/python-levenshtein/>\n\nfunctions in the `lang.data` module can supply functions to translate language\nnames using the `pycountry` package. it can even translate names in the format\n``language (country)`` such as ``english (south africa)`` this is used by\npootle and virtaal. if the package is not installed, the language names will\nsimply appear in english. it is therefore recommended you install the\n`pycountry` package.\n\nthe package vobject is needed for ical2po and po2ical.\n\nthe aeidon package (or gaupol if aeidon is not available) is needed for sub2po\nand po2sub. some unicode encoded files (including most files from\n<http://dotsub.com/>) require version 0.14 or later.\n<http://home.gna.org/gaupol/>\ngaupol might need the 'universal encoding detector'\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet>\n\ntrados txt tm support requires the beautifulsoup parser\n<http://www.crummy.com/software/beautifulsoup/>\n\nmarkdown support requires the mistletoe parser\n<https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe>\n\nprogram overview\n----------------\n\nuse ``--help`` to find the syntax and options for all programs.\n\n* converters::\n\n        oo2po    - convert between openoffice.org gsi files and po\n        oo2xliff - convert between openoffice.org
