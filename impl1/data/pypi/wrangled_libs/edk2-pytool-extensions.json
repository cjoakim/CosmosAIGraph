documentation at [https://www.tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-extensions](https://www.tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-extensions/)!\r\n\r\nthis is a tianocore maintained project consisting of command line and other\r\npython tools and extensions for building and maintaining an edk2 based uefi\r\nfirmware code tree. part of these tools include \"invocables\" that can be used to\r\nbuild edk2 platforms and these tools are known as \"stuart\". this package's\r\nintent is to provide tools, scripts, and a plugin based environment for use\r\nwithin the tools and scripts. this environment has command line interfaces to\r\nsupport building a product, building ci, running tests, and downloading\r\ndependencies. this environment also provides the building blocks for developers\r\nto write their own tools to launch in the environment and leverage the\r\ncapabilities provided by the environment. the unique capabilities provided help\r\nsupport building products with multiple repositories and having each repository\r\ncontribute/plugin to the build process in a scalable way. the environment will\r\nscan the files in the code tree (multiple repos) and discover plugins,\r\ndependencies, path adjustments, environment variable settings, etc. this\r\nprovides easy methods for common repositories to share build tools/steps.\r\n\r\ninclusion of this package is best managed using pip/pypi.  this package makes\r\nuse of edk2-pytool-library.\r\n\r\nthis is a supplemental package and is not required to be used for edk2 builds.\r\n\r\n![stuart himself](stuart_logo.png \"stuart\")\r\n\r\n## current status\r\n\r\n[![codecov]][_codecov]\r\n[![ci]][_ci]\r\n\r\nthe code coverage and ci badges represent unit test status and the code\r\ncoverage of those unit tests. we require 100% unit test success\r\n(hence the pass / fail) and that code coverage percentage does not lower.\r\n\r\n| host type           | toolchain   | project    | integration tests |\r\n| :------------------ | :---------

release\r\n\r\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/edk2_pytool_extensions.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/edk2-pytool-extensions/)\r\n\r\nall release information is now tracked with github\r\n [tags](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-extensions/tags),\r\n [releases](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-extensions/releases) and\r\n [milestones](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-extensions/milestones).\r\n\r\n## content\r\n\r\nthe package contains cli tools and a basic common environment for running tools.\r\nthis common environment supports extensions, sub-classing, and plugin to allow\r\ngreat flexibility for building and maintaining a code tree.\r\n\r\nexamples:\r\n\r\n* ci build support with plugin\r\n* binary dependency resolution (nuget, urls, git repos)\r\n* loggers (file, memory, and colored console)\r\n* plugins (pre/post build, function injection)\r\n* wrapper around edk2 build\r\n* vardict and shellenvrionment to manage key/value pairs consistently across\r\n  entire process\r\n* nuget publishing tool to push new packages\r\n* omnicache - support a super cache of git repos to speed up creating and\r\n  updating multiple work spaces and minimizing filesystem impact\r\n\r\n## license\r\n\r\nall content in this repository is licensed under [bsd-2-clause plus

virtual environments.\r\nvirtual environments avoid changing the global python workspace and causing\r\nconflicting dependencies.  virtual environments are lightweight and easy to use.\r\n[learn more](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)\r\n\r\n* to install run `pip install --upgrade edk2-pytool-extensions`\r\n* to use in your python code\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from edk2toolext.<module> import <class>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## history\r\n\r\nthis project and functionality was ported from project mu. for history and\r\ndocumentation prior to this see the original project mu projects\r\n<https://github.com/microsoft/mu_pip_environment> and\r\n<https://github.com/microsoft/mu_pip_build>\r\n\r\n## contribution process\r\n\r\nthis project welcomes all types of contributions. for issues, bugs, and\r\nquestions it is best to open a [github\r\nissue](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-extensions/issues).\r\n\r\n### code contributions\r\n\r\nfor code

for the most recent release of edk2-pytool-extensions is hosted on\r\n[tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-extensions](https://www.tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-extensions/).\r\nraw documentation is located in the ```docs/``` folder and is split into two\r\nseparate categories. the first is located at ```docs/user/``` and is\r\ndocumentation and api references for those that are using this package in their\r\nown project. users can generate a local copy of the documentation by executing the\r\nfollowing command from the root of the project:\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\npip install --upgrade -e .[docs]\r\nmkdocs serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe second is located at ```docs/contributor/``` and is documentation for\r\ncontributing to the edk2-pytool-extensions repository.\r\n\r\n[codecov]:
