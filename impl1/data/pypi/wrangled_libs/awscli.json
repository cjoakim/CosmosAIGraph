  "description": "aws-cli\n=======\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml\n   :alt: build status\n\nthis package provides a unified command line interface to amazon web\nservices.\n\njump to:\n\n-  `getting started <#getting-started>`__\n-  `getting help <#getting-help>`__\n-  `more resources <#more-resources>`__\n\ngetting started\n---------------\n\nthis readme is for the aws cli version 1. if you are looking for\ninformation about the aws cli version 2, please visit the `v2\nbranch <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/tree/v2>`__.\n\nrequirements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nthe aws-cli package works on python versions:\n\n-  3.8.x and greater\n-  3.9.x and greater\n-  3.10.x and greater\n-  3.11.x and greater\n-  3.12.x and greater\n\nnotices\n~~~~~~~\n\non 2022-05-30, support for python 3.6 was ended. this follows the\npython software foundation `end of support <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/#lifespan>`__\nfor the runtime which occurred on 2021-12-23.\n\non 2023-12-13, support for python 3.7 was ended. this follows the\npython software foundation `end of support <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/#lifespan>`__\nfor the runtime which occurred on 2023-06-27.\nfor more information, see this `blog post <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/>`__.\n\n*attention!*\n\n*we recommend that all customers regularly monitor the* `amazon web\nservices security bulletins\nwebsite <https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins>`__ *for\nany important security bulletins related to aws-cli.*\n\nmaintenance and support for cli major versions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nthe aws cli version 1 was made generally available on 09/02/2013 and is currently in the full support phase of the availability life cycle.\n\nfor information about maintenance and support for sdk major versions and their underlying dependencies, see the `maintenance policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/maint-policy.html>`__ section in the *aws sdks and tools shared configuration and credentials reference guide*.\n\ninstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\ninstallation of the aws cli and its dependencies use a range of packaging\nfeatures provided by ``pip`` and ``setuptools``. to ensure smooth installation,\nit's recommended to use:\n\n- ``pip``: 9.0.2 or greater\n- ``setuptools``: 36.2.0 or greater\n\nthe safest way to install the aws cli is to use\n`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ in a ``virtualenv``:\n\n::\n\n   $ python -m pip install awscli\n\nor, if you are not installing in a ``virtualenv``, to install globally:\n\n::\n\n   $ sudo python -m pip install awscli\n\nor for your user:\n\n::\n\n   $ python -m pip install --user awscli\n\nif you have the aws-cli package installed and want to upgrade to the\nlatest version, you can run:\n\n::\n\n   $ python -m pip install --upgrade awscli\n\nthis will install the aws-cli package as well as all dependencies.\n\n.. note::\n   on macos, if you see an error regarding the version of ``six`` that\n   came with ``distutils`` in el capitan, use the ``--ignore-installed``\n   option:\n\n::\n\n   $ sudo python -m pip install awscli --ignore-installed six\n\non linux and mac os, the aws cli can be installed using a `bundled\ninstaller <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html#install-linux-bundled>`__.\nthe aws cli can also be installed on windows via an `msi\ninstaller <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html#msi-on-windows>`__.\n\nif you want to run the ``develop`` branch of the aws cli, see the\n`development version <contributing.md#cli-development-version>`__ section of\nthe contributing guide.\n\nsee the\n`installation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html>`__\nsection of the aws cli user guide for more information.\n\nconfiguration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nbefore using the aws cli, you need to configure your aws credentials.\nyou can do this in several ways:\n\n-  configuration command\n-  environment variables\n-  shared credentials file\n-  config file\n-  iam role\n\nthe quickest way to get started is to run the ``aws configure`` command:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws configure\n   aws access key id: myaccesskey\n   aws secret access key: mysecretkey\n   default region name [us-west-2]: us-west-2\n   default output format [none]: json\n\nto use environment variables, do the following:\n\n::\n\n   $ export aws_access_key_id=<access_key>\n   $ export aws_secret_access_key=<secret_key>\n\nto use the shared credentials file, create an ini formatted file like\nthis:\n\n::\n\n   [default]\n   aws_access_key_id=myaccesskey\n   aws_secret_access_key=mysecretkey\n\n   [testing]\n   aws_access_key_id=myacceskey\n   aws_secret_access_key=mysecretkey\n\nand place it in ``~/.aws/credentials`` (or in\n``%userprofile%\\.aws/credentials`` on windows). if you wish to place the\nshared credentials file in a different location than the one specified\nabove, you need to tell aws-cli where to find it. do this by setting the\nappropriate environment variable:\n\n::\n\n   $ export aws_shared_credentials_file=/path/to/shared_credentials_file\n\nto use a config file, create an ini formatted file like this:\n\n::\n\n   [default]\n   aws_access_key_id=<default access key>\n   aws_secret_access_key=<default secret key>\n   # optional, to define default region for this profile.\n   region=us-west-1\n\n   [profile testing]\n   aws_access_key_id=<testing access key>\n   aws_secret_access_key=<testing secret key>\n   region=us-west-2\n\nand place it in ``~/.aws/config`` (or in ``%userprofile%\\.aws\\config``\non windows). if you wish to place the config file in a different\nlocation than the one specified above, you need to tell the aws cli\nwhere to find it. do this by setting the appropriate environment\nvariable:\n\n::\n\n   $ export aws_config_file=/path/to/config_file\n\nas you can see, you can have multiple ``profiles`` defined in both the\nshared credentials file and the configuration file. you can then specify\nwhich profile to use by using the ``--profile`` option. if no profile is\nspecified the ``default`` profile is used.\n\nin the config file, except for the default profile, you **must** prefix\neach config section of a profile group with ``profile``. for example, if\nyou have a profile named \"testing\" the section header would be\n``[profile testing]``.\n\nthe final option for credentials is highly recommended if you are using\nthe aws cli on an ec2 instance. `iam\nroles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsec2/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html>`__\nare a great way to have credentials installed automatically on your\ninstance. if you are using iam roles, the aws cli will find and use them\nautomatically.\n\nin addition to credentials, a number of other variables can be\nconfigured either with environment variables, configuration file\nentries, or both. see the `aws tools and sdks shared configuration and\ncredentials reference\nguide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/overview.html>`__\nfor more information.\n\nfor more information about configuration options, please refer to the\n`aws cli configuration variables\ntopic <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html#cli-aws-help-config-vars>`__.\nyou can access this topic from the aws cli as well by running\n``aws help config-vars``.\n\nbasic commands\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nan aws cli command has the following structure:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws <command> <subcommand> [options and parameters]\n\nfor example, to list s3 buckets, the command would be:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws s3 ls\n\nto view help documentation, use one of the following:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws help\n   $ aws <command> help\n   $ aws <command> <subcommand> help\n\nto get the version of the aws cli:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws --version\n\nto turn on debugging output:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws --debug <command> <subcommand>\n\nyou can read more information on the `using the aws\ncli <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-using.html>`__\nchapter of the aws cli user guide.\n\ncommand completion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nthe aws-cli package includes a command completion feature for unix-like\nsystems. this feature is not automatically installed so you need to\nconfigure it manually. to learn more, read the `aws cli command\ncompletion\ntopic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-completion.html>`__.\n\ngetting help\n------------\n\nthe best way to interact with our team is through github. you can `open\nan issue <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/new/choose>`__ and\nchoose from one of our templates for guidance, bug reports, or feature\nrequests.\n\nyou may find help from the community on `stack\noverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`__ with the tag\n`aws-cli <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-cli>`__ or on\nthe `aws discussion forum for\ncli <https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumid=150>`__. if you\nhave a support plan with `aws support\n<https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport>`__, you can also create\na new support case.\n\nplease check for open similar\n`issues <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/>`__ before opening\nanother one.\n\nthe aws cli implements aws service apis. for general
