  "description": "pdfminer.six\n============\n\n[![continuous integration](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/actions/workflows/actions.yml)\n[![pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pdfminer.six.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfminer.six/)\n[![gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/pdfminer-six/lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/pdfminer-six/lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium)\n\n*we fathom pdf*\n\npdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original pdfminer. it is a tool for extracting information from pdf\ndocuments. it focuses on getting and analyzing text data. pdfminer.six extracts the text from a page directly from the\nsourcecode of the pdf. it can also be used to get the exact location, font or color of the text.\n\nit is built in a modular way such that each component of pdfminer.six can be replaced easily. you can implement your own\ninterpreter or rendering device that uses the power of pdfminer.six for other purposes than text analysis.\n\ncheck out the full documentation on\n[read the docs](https://pdfminersix.readthedocs.io).\n\n\nfeatures\n--------\n\n* written entirely in python.\n* parse, analyze, and convert pdf documents.\n* extract content as text, images, html or [hocr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hocr).\n* pdf-1.7 specification support. (well, almost).\n* cjk languages and vertical writing scripts support.\n* various font types (type1, truetype, type3, and cid) support.\n* support for extracting images (jpg, jbig2, bitmaps).\n* support for various compressions (asciihexdecode, ascii85decode, lzwdecode, flatedecode, runlengthdecode,\n  ccittfaxdecode)\n* support for rc4 and aes encryption.\n* support for acroform interactive form extraction.\n* table of contents extraction.\n* tagged contents extraction.\n* automatic layout analysis.\n\nhow to use\n----------\n\n* install python 3.8 or newer.\n* install pdfminer.six.\n\n  `pip install pdfminer.six`\n\n* (optionally) install extra dependencies for extracting images.\n\n  `pip install 'pdfminer.six[image]'`\n\n* use the command-line interface to extract text from pdf.\n\n  `pdf2txt.py example.pdf`\n\n* or use it with python. \n\n```python\nfrom pdfminer.high_level import extract_text\n\ntext = extract_text(\"example.pdf\")\nprint(text)\n```\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\nbe sure to read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/blob/master/contributing.md). \n\nacknowledgement\n---------------\n\nthis repository includes code from `pyhanko` ; the original license has been included [here](/docs/licenses/license.pyhanko).\n\n\n",
