supporting sparql 1.1 queries and update statements\n* sparql function extension mechanisms\n\n## rdflib family of packages\nthe rdflib community maintains many rdf-related python code repositories with different purposes. for example:\n\n* [rdflib](https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib) - the rdflib core\n* [sparqlwrapper](https://github.com/rdflib/sparqlwrapper) - a simple python wrapper around a sparql service to remotely execute your queries\n* [pylode](https://github.com/rdflib/pylode) - an owl ontology documentation tool using python and templating, based on lode.\n* [pyrdfa3](https://github.com/rdflib/pyrdfa3) - rdfa 1.1 distiller/parser library: can extract rdfa 1.1/1.0 from (x)html, svg, or xml in general.\n* [pymicrodata](https://github.com/rdflib/pymicrodata) - a module to extract rdf from an html5 page annotated with microdata. \n* [pyshacl](https://github.com/rdflib/pyshacl) - a pure python module which allows for the validation of rdf graphs against shacl graphs.\n* [owl-rl](https://github.com/rdflib/owl-rl) - a simple implementation of the owl2 rl profile which expands the graph with all possible triples that owl rl defines.\n\nplease see the list for all packages/repositories here:\n\n* <https://github.com/rdflib>\n\nhelp with maintenance of all of the rdflib family of packages is always welcome and appreciated.\n\n## versions & releases\n\n* `7.1.0a0` current `main` branch.\n* `7.x.y` current release, supports python 3.8.1+ only.\n    * see [releases](https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib/releases)\n* `6.x.y` supports python 3.7+ only. many improvements over 5.0.0\n    * see [releases](https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib/releases)\n* `5.x.y` supports python 2.7 and 3.4+ and is [mostly backwards compatible with 4.2.2](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/upgrade4to5.html).\n\nsee <https://rdflib.dev> for the release overview.\n\n## documentation\nsee <https://rdflib.readthedocs.io> for our documentation built from the code. note that there are `latest`, `stable` `5.0.0` and `4.2.2` documentation versions, matching releases.\n\n## installation\nthe stable release of rdflib may be installed with python's package management tool *pip*:\n\n    $ pip install rdflib\n\nalternatively manually download the package from the python package\nindex (pypi) at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rdflib\n\nthe current version of rdflib is 7.0.0, see the ``changelog.md`` file for what's new in this release.\n\n### installation of the current main branch (for developers)\n\nwith *pip* you can also install rdflib from the git repository with one of the following options:\n\n    $ pip install git+https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib@main\n\nor\n\n    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib@main#egg=rdflib\n\nor from your locally cloned repository you can install it with one of the following options:\n\n    $ poetry install  # installs into a poetry-managed venv\n\nor\n\n    $ pip install -e .\n\n## getting started\nrdflib aims to be a pythonic rdf api. rdflib's main data object is a `graph` which is a python collection\nof rdf *subject, predicate, object* triples:\n\nto create graph and load it with rdf data from dbpedia then print the results:\n\n```python\nfrom rdflib import graph\ng = graph()\ng.parse('http://dbpedia.org/resource/semantic_web')\n\nfor s, p, o in g:\n    print(s, p, o)\n```\nthe components of the triples are uris (resources) or literals\n(values).\n\nuris are grouped together by *namespace*, common namespaces are included in rdflib:\n\n```python\nfrom rdflib.namespace import dc, dcterms, doap, foaf, skos, owl, rdf, rdfs, void, xmlns, xsd\n```\n\nyou can use them like this:\n\n```python\nfrom rdflib import graph, uriref, literal\nfrom rdflib.namespace import rdfs, xsd\n\ng = graph()\nsemweb = uriref('http://dbpedia.org/resource/semantic_web')\ntype = g.value(semweb, rdfs.label)\n```\nwhere `rdfs` is the rdfs namespace, `xsd` the xml schema datatypes namespace and `g.value` returns an object of the triple-pattern given (or an arbitrary one if multiple exist).\n\nor like this, adding a triple to a graph `g`:\n\n```python\ng.add((\n    uriref(\"http://example.com/person/nick\"),\n    foaf.givenname,\n    literal(\"nick\", datatype=xsd.string)\n))\n```\nthe triple (in n-triples notation) `<http://example.com/person/nick> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenname> \"nick\"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema#string> .`\nis created where the property `foaf.givenname` is the uri `<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenname>` and `xsd.string` is the\nuri `<http://www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema#string>`.\n\nyou can bind namespaces to prefixes to shorten the uris for rdf/xml, turtle, n3, trig, trix & json-ld serializations:\n\n ```python\ng.bind(\"foaf\", foaf)\ng.bind(\"xsd\", xsd)\n```\nthis will allow the n-triples triple above to be serialised like this:\n ```python\nprint(g.serialize(format=\"turtle\"))\n```\n\nwith these results:\n```turtle\nprefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nprefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema#>\n\n<http://example.com/person/nick> foaf:givenname \"nick\"^^xsd:string .\n```\n\nnew namespaces can also be defined:\n\n```python\ndbpedia = namespace('http://dbpedia.org/ontology/')\n\nabstracts = list(x for x in g.objects(semweb, dbpedia['abstract']) if x.language=='en')\n```\n\nsee also [./examples](./examples)\n\n\n## features\nthe library contains parsers and serializers for rdf/xml, n3,\nntriples, n-quads, turtle, trix, json-ld, rdfa and microdata.\n\nthe library presents a graph interface which can be backed by\nany one of a number of store implementations.\n\nthis core rdflib package includes store implementations for\nin-memory storage and persistent storage on top of the berkeley db.\n\na sparql 1.1 implementation is included - supporting sparql 1.1 queries and update statements.\n\nrdflib is open source and is maintained on [github](https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib/). rdflib releases, current and previous\nare listed on [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rdflib/)\n\nmultiple other projects are contained within the rdflib \"family\", see <https://github.com/rdflib/>.\n\n## running tests\n\n### running the tests on the host\n\nrun the test suite with `pytest`.\n```shell\npoetry install\npoetry run pytest\n```\n\n### running test coverage on the host with coverage report\n\nrun the test suite and generate a html coverage report with `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.\n```shell\npoetry run pytest --cov\n```\n\n### viewing test coverage\n\nonce tests have produced html output of the coverage report, view it by running:\n```shell\npoetry run pytest --cov --cov-report term --cov-report html\npython -m http.server --directory=htmlcov\n```\n\n## contributing\n\nrdflib survives and grows via user contributions!\nplease read our [contributing guide](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) and [developers guide](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers.html) to get started.\nplease consider lodging pull requests here:\n\n* <https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib/pulls>\n\nto get a development environment consider using gitpod or google cloud shell.\n\n[![open in gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib)\n[![open in cloud shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://shell.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https%3a%2f%2fgithub.com%2frdflib%2frdflib&cloudshell_git_branch=main&cloudshell_open_in_editor=readme.md)\n\nyou can also raise issues here:\n\n* <https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib/issues>\n\n## support & contacts\nfor general \"how do i...\" queries, please use https://stackoverflow.com and tag your question with `rdflib`.\nexisting questions:\n\n* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rdflib>\n\nif you want to contact the rdflib maintainers, please do so via:\n\n* the rdflib-dev mailing list: <https://groups.google.com/group/rdflib-dev>\n* the chat, which is available at [gitter](https://gitter.im/rdflib/rdflib) or via matrix [#rdflib_rdflib:gitter.im](https://matrix.to/#/#rdflib_rdflib:gitter.im)\n",
