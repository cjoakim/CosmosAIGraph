  "description": "pytest-repeat\n===================\n\npytest-repeat is a plugin for `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org>`_ that makes it\neasy to repeat a single test, or multiple tests, a specific number of times.\n\n|license| |python| |version| |anaconda| |ci| |issues|\n\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-mpl%202.0-blue.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat/blob/master/license\n\n.. |version| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pytest-repeat.svg\n  :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-repeat\n\n.. |anaconda| image:: https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/pytest-repeat.svg\n    :target: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytest-repeat\n\n.. |ci| image:: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat/workflows/test/badge.svg\n  :target: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat/actions\n\n.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pytest-repeat.svg\n  :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-repeat/\n\n.. |issues| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat/issues\n\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\nyou will need the following prerequisites in order to use pytest-repeat:\n\n- python 3.7+ or pypy3\n- pytest 4 or newer\n\ninstallation\n------------\nto install pytest-repeat:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ pip install pytest-repeat\n\nrepeating a test\n----------------\n\nuse the :code:`--count` command line option to specify how many times you want\nyour test, or tests, to be run:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ pytest --count=10 test_file.py\n\neach test collected by pytest will be run :code:`count` times.\n\nif you want to mark a test in your code to be repeated a number of times, you\ncan use the :code:`@pytest.mark.repeat(count)` decorator:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   import pytest\n\n\n   @pytest.mark.repeat(3)\n   def test_repeat_decorator():\n       pass\n\nif you want to override default tests executions order, you can use :code:`--repeat-scope`\ncommand line option with one of the next values: :code:`session`,  :code:`module`, :code:`class` or :code:`function` (default).\nit behaves like a scope of the pytest fixture.\n\n:code:`function` (default) scope repeats each test :code:`count` or :code:`repeat` times before executing next test.\n:code:`session` scope repeats whole tests session, i.e. all collected tests executed once, then all such tests executed again and etc.\n:code:`class` and :code:`module` behaves similar :code:`session` , but repeating set of tests is a tests from class or module, not all collected tests.\n\nrepeating a test until failure\n------------------------------\n\nif you are trying to diagnose an intermittent failure, it can be useful to run the same\ntest over and over again until it fails. you can use pytest's :code:`-x` option in\nconjunction with pytest-repeat to force the test runner to stop at the first failure.\nfor example:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ pytest --count=1000 -x test_file.py\n\nthis will attempt to run test_file.py 1000 times, but will stop as soon as a failure\noccurs.\n\nunittest style tests\n--------------------\n\nunfortunately pytest-repeat is not able to work with unittest.testcase test classes.\nthese tests will simply always run once, regardless of :code:`--count`, and show a warning.\n\nresources\n---------\n\n- `release notes <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat/blob/master/changes.rst>`_\n- `issue tracker <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat/issues>`_\n- `code <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-repeat/>`_\n",
