  "description": "![vtk - the visualization toolkit][vtk-banner]\n\nintroduction\n============\n\nvtk is an open-source software system for image processing, 3d\ngraphics, volume rendering and visualization. vtk includes many\nadvanced algorithms (e.g., surface reconstruction, implicit modeling,\ndecimation) and rendering techniques (e.g., hardware-accelerated\nvolume rendering, lod control).\n\nvtk is used by academicians for teaching and research; by government\nresearch institutions such as los alamos national lab in the us or\ncineca in italy; and by many commercial firms who use vtk to build or\nextend products.\n\nthe origin of vtk is with the textbook \"the visualization toolkit, an\nobject-oriented approach to 3d graphics\" originally published by\nprentice hall and now published by kitware, inc. (third edition isbn\n1-930934-07-6). vtk has grown (since its initial release in 1994) to a\nworld-wide user base in the commercial, academic, and research\ncommunities.\n\nlearning resources\n==================\n\n* general information is available at the [vtk homepage][vtk-homepage].\n\n* community discussion takes place on the [vtk discourse][vtk-discourse] forum.\n\n* commercial [support and training][kitware-support]\n  are available from [kitware][].\n\n* doxygen-generated nightly reference documentation is\n  available [online][vtk-doxygen].\n\n* there is now a large collection of [vtk examples][vtk-examples] that\n  showcase vtk features and provide a useful learning resource.\n\nreporting bugs\n==============\n\nif you have found a bug:\n\n1. if you have a patch, please read the [contributing.md][vtk-contributing] document.\n\n2. otherwise, please join the [vtk discourse][vtk-discourse] forum and ask\n   about the expected and observed behaviors to determine if it is\n   really a bug.\n\n3. finally, if the issue is not resolved by the above steps, open\n   an entry in the [vtk issue tracker][vtk-issues].\n\nrequirements\n============\n\nin general vtk tries to be as portable as possible; the specific configurations below are known to work and tested.\n\nvtk supports the following compilers:\n\n1. gcc 4.8 or newer\n2. clang 3.3 or newer\n3. apple clang 5.0 (from xcode 5.0) or newer\n4. microsoft visual studio 2015 or newer\n5. intel 14.0 or newer\n\nvtk supports the following operating systems:\n\n1. windows vista or newer\n2. mac os x 10.7 or newer\n3. linux (ex: ubuntu 12.04 or newer, debian 4 or newer)\n\nbuilding\n========\n\nsee [build.md][vtk-build] (in documentation/dev/) for build instructions.\n\ncontributing\n============\n\nsee [contributing.md][vtk-contributing] for instructions to contribute.\n\nlicense\n=======\n\nvtk is distributed under the osi-approved bsd 3-clause license.\nsee [copyright.txt][vtk-copyright] for details.\n\n\n[kitware]: https://www.kitware.com/\n[kitware-support]: https://www.kitware.com/support/\n[vtk-banner]: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/raw/master/vtkbanner.gif\n[vtk-build]: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/blob/master/documentation/dev/build.md#building-vtk\n[vtk-contributing]: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/blob/master/contributing.md#contributing-to-vtk\n[vtk-copyright]: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/raw/master/copyright.txt\n[vtk-discourse]: https://discourse.vtk.org/\n[vtk-doxygen]: https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html\n[vtk-examples]: https://kitware.github.io/vtk-examples/site/\n[vtk-homepage]: https://www.vtk.org/\n[vtk-issues]: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/issues\n",
