  "description": "ffmpeg wrapper for python.\n\nnote that the platform-specific wheels contain the binary executable\nof ffmpeg, which makes this package around 60 mib in size.\ni guess that's the cost for being able to read/write video files.\n\nfor linux users: the above is not the case when installing via your\nlinux package manager (if that is possible), because this package would\nsimply depend on ffmpeg in that case.\n",
