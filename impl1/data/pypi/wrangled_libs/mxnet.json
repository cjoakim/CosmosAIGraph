  "description": "apache mxnet (incubating) python package\n========================================\n[apache mxnet](http://beta.mxnet.io) is a deep learning framework designed for both *efficiency* and *flexibility*.\nit allows you to mix the flavours of deep learning programs together to maximize the efficiency and your productivity.\n\nfor feature requests on the pypi package, suggestions, and issue reports, create an issue by clicking [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/new).\nprerequisites\n-------------\nthis package supports linux, mac osx, and windows platforms. you may also want to check:\n\n- [mxnet-cu112](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu112/) with cuda-11.2 support.\n- [mxnet-cu110](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu110/) with cuda-11.0 support.\n- [mxnet-cu102](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu102/) with cuda-10.2 support.\n- [mxnet-cu101](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu101/) with cuda-10.1 support.\n- [mxnet-cu100](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu100/) with cuda-10.0 support.\n- [mxnet-native](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-native/) cpu variant without mkldnn.\n\nto use this package on linux you need the `libquadmath.so.0` shared library. on\ndebian based systems, including ubuntu, run `sudo apt install libquadmath0` to\ninstall the shared library. on rhel based systems, including centos, run `sudo\nyum install libquadmath` to install the shared library. as `libquadmath.so.0` is\na gpl library and mxnet part of the apache software foundation, mxnet must not\nredistribute `libquadmath.so.0` as part of the pypi package and users must\nmanually install it.\n\nto install for other platforms (e.g. windows, raspberry pi/arm) or other versions, check [installing mxnet](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/master) for instructions on building from source.\n\ninstallation\n------------\nto install, use:\n```bash\npip install mxnet\n```\n\n",
