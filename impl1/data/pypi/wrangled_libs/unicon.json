  "description": "unicon - universal connection library\n=====================================\n\nunicon is a package aiming to provide a unified connection experience to network\ndevices through typical command-line management interface. by wrapping the \nunderlying session (eg, telnet, ssh), unicon provides:\n\n- direct and proxied connections through any common cli interface (telnet, ssh, serial etc)\n- power of expect-like programming without having to deal with low-level logic\n- multi-vendor support through an agnostic api interface\n- seamless handling of cli modes (eg, enable, configure, admin-configure mode)\n- rejected commands, command error detections\n- value-add statful services (specific to the platform)\n\nand is extensible: platform supports and services are implemented via \nopen-source plugins.\n\nunicon is the standard, go-to cli connection implementation for `cisco pyats`_\nframework.\n\n.. _cisco pyats: https://developer.cisco.com/site/pyats/\n\nthis package was initially developed internally in cisco, and is now \nrelease to the general public starting late 2017 through `cisco devnet`_. \n\n    https://developer.cisco.com/pyats/\n    \n.. _cisco devnet: https://developer.cisco.com/\n\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\n- linux/macos/wsl\n- python 3.4+\n\nquick start\n-----------\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    bash$ pip install unicon\n\n\nfor more information on setting up your python development environment,\nsuch as creating virtual environment and installing ``pip`` on your system, \nplease refer to `virtual environment and packages`_ in python tutorials.\n\n.. _virtual environment and packages: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html\n\nexamples\n--------\n\nsee example of a unicon connection usage with cisco ios devices at:\n\n    https://github.com/ciscodevnet/pyats-ios-sample\n\nin addition, there is a sample plugin package you can follow to develop unicon\nplugins for new platforms on top of unicon:\n\n    https://github.com/ciscodevnet/pyats-plugin-examples/tree/master/unicon_plugin_example\n\nsupport & community\n-------------------\n\nsee https://developer.cisco.com/docs/pyats/#!license-support page for details.\n",
