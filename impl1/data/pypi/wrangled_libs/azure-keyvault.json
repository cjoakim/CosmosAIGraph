  "description": "# azure key vault client libraries for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure key vault libraries bundle.\n\nthis package does not contain any code in itself. it installs a set\nof packages that provide apis for key vault operations:\n\n- [azure-keyvault-keys v4.x](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-keyvault-keys)\n- [azure-keyvault-secrets v4.x](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-keyvault-secrets)\n- [azure-keyvault-certificates v4.x](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-keyvault-certificates)\n\n\n## _disclaimer_\n\n_azure sdk python packages support for python 2.7 has ended 01 january 2022. for more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_\n\n\n## install the package\ninstall the azure key vault client libraries for python with [pip][pip]:\n\n```bash\npip install azure-keyvault\n```\n\n## documentation\n\nplease refer to the individual packages for documentation.\n\n## contributing\nthis project welcomes contributions and suggestions. most contributions require\nyou to agree to a contributor license agreement (cla) declaring that you have\nthe right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution.\nfor details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.\n\nwhen you submit a pull request, a cla-bot will automatically determine whether\nyou need to provide a cla and decorate the pr appropriately (e.g., label,\ncomment). simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. you will only\nneed to do this once across all repos using our cla.\n\nthis project has adopted the\n[microsoft open source code of conduct][code_of_conduct]. for more information,\nsee the code of conduct faq or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any\nadditional questions or comments.\n\n[code_of_conduct]: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/\n\n![impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fsdk%2fkeyvault%2fazure-keyvault%2ffreadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 4.2.0 (2022-03-29)\n**disclaimer**\n\nthis package and the `azure.keyvault` namespace does not contain code anymore. this package now installs three sub-packages instead:\n\n* [azure-keyvault-certificates](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-certificates/)\n* [azure-keyvault-keys](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-keys/)\n* [azure-keyvault-secrets](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-secrets/)\n\nall code needs to be adapted to use the new namespaces. see individual package readmes for details.\n\n## other changes\n- python 2.7 is no longer supported. please use python version 3.6 or later.\n\n## 4.1.0 (2020-04-10)\n**disclaimer**\n\nthis package and the `azure.keyvault` namespace does not contain code anymore. this package now installs three sub-packages instead:\n\n* [azure-keyvault-certificates](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-certificates/)\n* [azure-keyvault-keys](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-keys/)\n* [azure-keyvault-secrets](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-secrets/)\n\nall code needs to be adapted to use the new namespaces. see individual package readmes for details.\n\n\n## 4.0.0 (2019-10-31)\n\n**disclaimer**\n\nthis package and the `azure.keyvault` namespace does not contain code anymore. this package now installs three sub-packages instead:\n\n* azure-keyvault-keys\n* azure-keyvault-secrets\n\ncertificates scenarios are in preview with the additional package `azure-keyvault-certificates`.\n\nall code needs to be adapted to use the new namespaces. see individual package readme for details.\n\n## 1.1.0 (2018-08-07)\n\n* adding support for multi-api and api profiles\n\n## 1.0.0 (2018-06-27)\n\n* moving azure-keyvault to stable api version 7.0\n* adding support for ec certificate create and import\n* renaming curve secp256k1 and algorithm ecdsa256 to p-256k and es256k respectively\n\n## 1.0.0b1 (2018-04-10)\n\n* upgraded to autorest 3.0 generated code\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.\n\n- model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. all positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.\n  to keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for python 2 and python 3. python 3 uses the \"*\" syntax for keyword-only arguments.\n- enum types now use the \"str\" mixin (class azureenum(str, enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.\n  while this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:\n  https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others\n  at a glance:\n\n  - \"is\" should not be used at all.\n  - \"format\" will return the string value, where \"%s\" string formatting will return `nameofenum.stringvalue`. format syntax should be preferred.\n\n- new long running operation:\n\n  - return type changes from `msrestazure.azure_operation.azureoperationpoller` to `msrest.polling.lropoller`. external api is the same.\n  - return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.lropoller`, regardless of the optional parameters used.\n  - the behavior has changed when using `raw=true`. instead of returning the initial call result as `clientrawresponse`,\n    without polling, now this returns an lropoller. after polling, the final resource will be returned as a `clientrawresponse`.\n  - new `polling` parameter. the default behavior is `polling=true` which will poll using arm algorithm. when `polling=false`,\n    the response of the initial call will be returned without polling.\n  - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of `msrest.polling.pollingmethod`.\n  - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right away.\n\n\n## 1.0.0a2 (2018-03-28)\n\n* upgrading to api version 7.0-preview\n* adding elliptic curve key support\n* adding managed storage account key backup, restore and soft delete support\n* breaking update to managed storage account sasdefinition creation\n* adding certificate backup and restore support\n* adding certificate transparency\n\n## 1.0.0a1 (2018-01-25)\n\n* added message encryption support for message encryption enabled vaults\n\n## 0.3.7 (2017-09-22)\n\n* workaround for azure stack adfs authentication issue https://github.com/azure/azure-cli/issues/4448\n\n## 0.3.6 (2017-08-16)\n\n* updated keyvaultclient to accept both keyvaultauthentication and azure.common.credentials instances for authentication\n\n## 0.3.5 (2017-06-23)\n\n* fix: https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/1159\n* keyvaultid refactoring\n  - adding object specific id classes to make usage more uniform with other key vault sdks\n  - added storage account id and storage sas definition id parsing and formatting\n\n## 0.3.4 (2017-06-07)\n\n* adding preview features\n  - managed storage account keys for managing storage credentials and provisioning sas tokens\n  - key vault \"soft delete\" allowing for recovery of deleted keys, secrets and certificates\n  - secret backup and restore for secret recovery and migration\n\n## 0.3.3 (2017-05-10)\n\n* reverting to 0.3.0, since behavior of 0.3.2 is not satisfying either.\n\n## 0.3.2 (2017-05-09)\n\n* fix critical regression on 0.3.1 (#1157)\n* now the client respects 'requests_ca_bundle' and 'curl_ca_bundle'\n\n## 0.3.1 (2017-05-09)\n\n* support for requests_ca_bundle (#1154)\n\n## 0.3.0 (2017-05-08)\n\n* moving keyvaultclient class to the azure.keyvault namespace\n* moving model classes to the azure.keyvault.models namespace\n* deprecating 'generated' namespaces azure.keyvault.generated and azure.keyvault.generated.models\n* exposed keyvaultid class through azure.keyvault namespace\n* moving identifier parsing methods to static methods on keyvaultid class\n* removing convenience overridden methods from keyvaultclient\n  - update_key(self, key_identifier, ...\n  - get_key(self, key_identifier, ...\n  - encrypt(self, key_identifier, ...\n  - decrypt(self, key_identifier, ...\n  - sign(self, key_identifier, ...\n  - verify(self, key_identifier, ...\n  - wrap_key(self, key_identifier, ...\n  - unwrap_key(self, key_identifier, ...\n  - update_secret(self, secret_identifier, ...\n  - get_secret(self, secret_identifier, ...\n  - get_certificate(self, certificate_identifier, ...\n\n## 0.2.0 (2017-04-09)\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n- fix possible deserialization error, but updating from list<enumtype> to list<str> when applicable\n\n**notes**\n\n- this wheel package is now built with the azure wheel extension\n\n## 0.1.0 (2016-12-29)\n\n* initial release\n\n\n",
