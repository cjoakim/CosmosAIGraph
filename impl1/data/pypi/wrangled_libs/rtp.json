  "description": "# rtp\n\nthis python library provides a means to decode, encode, and interact with rtp packets. it is intended to be used together with other libraries that decode, encode, and interact with the payload bitstreams. this library does not provide any network functionality.\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\npip install rtp\n```\n\n## example usage\n```python\nfrom rtp import rtp, extension, payloadtype\nfrom copy import deepcopy\n\nbasertp = rtp(\n    marker=true,\n    payloadtype=payloadtype.l16_2chan,\n    extension=extension(\n        startbits=getextstartbits(),\n        headerextension=getextbody()\n        ),\n    csrclist=getcsrclist()\n)\nthisrtpbitstream = thisrtp.tobytearray()\n\nwhile runing:\n    nextrtp = deepcopy(basertp)\n    nextrtp.sequencenumber += 1\n    nextrtp.timestamp = getnexttimestamp()\n    nextrtp.payload = getnextpayload()\n\n    transmit(nextrtp)\n```\n\n```python\nfrom rtp import rtp\n\ndecodedpayload = mypayloaddecoder(\n    rtp().frombytearray(getnextpacket()).payload)\n\nrender(decodedpayload)\n```\n\n## contributing\nwe desire that contributors of pull requests have signed, and submitted via email, a [contributor licence agreement (cla)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/cla/rfc-8759-cla.docx), which is based on the apache cla.\n\nthe purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the bbc and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time.\n\nif you haven't signed and emailed the agreement yet then the project owners will contact you using the contact info with the pull request.\n\n## license\nsee [license](license).\n\n## authors\n\n* james sandford\n\nfor further information, contact <cloudfit-opensource@rd.bbc.co.uk>\n",
