  "description": "# python-sasl\n\npython wrapper for cyrus sasl\n\n## how `sasl3` is different from `sasl` package? \n\nthis is a fork from original work from cloudera's package [sasl](https://github.com/cloudera/python-sasl) package. \n\noriginal package wasn't maintained and had issue wth latest python 3 releases, and also had runtime issues running \non rhel6. python `sasl3` package solves these issues.\n\n## external dependencies\n\nyou need following external packages installed on the system to pip-install `sasl3` :\n- c compiler (e.g. `gcc`)\n- `cyrus-sasl-devel` package for cyrus header files.\n\nboth can be installed with os' package manager, e.g. \n```bash\nyum install gcc cyrus-sasl-devel.x86_64\n\n```\n\n## to generate sasl/saslwrapper.cpp from the pyx file:\n\nrun `./recython.sh`",
