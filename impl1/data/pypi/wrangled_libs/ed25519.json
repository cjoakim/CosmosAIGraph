  "description": "python bindings to the ed25519 public-key signature system.\n\nthis offers a comfortable python interface to a c implementation of the\ned25519 public-key signature system (http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/), using the\nportable 'ref' code from the 'supercop' benchmarking suite.\n\nthis system provides high (128-bit) security, short (32-byte) keys, short\n(64-byte) signatures, and fast (2-6ms) operation. please see the readme for\nmore details.\n\n## not recommended for new applications: use pynacl instead\n\nfor new applications, i recommend you use\n[`pynacl`](https://github.com/pyca/pynacl) instead of this repository.\n`pynacl` is larger and takes longer to build (it contains the complete\nnacl/libsodium library, not just the ed25519 portion), but it is\nwell-maintained by the diligent and conscientious pyca team, whereas i've\nallowed this repository to languish. `pynacl` is also about 10-20 times\nfaster. a guide for migration fron `python-ed25519` to `pynacl` is included\nbelow.",
