  "description": "# striprtf\n![build status](https://github.com/joshy/striprtf/workflows/striprtf%20build/badge.svg)\n\n## purpose\nthis is a simple library to convert rtf files to python strings. a lot of\nmedical documents are written in rtf format which is not ideal for parsing\nand further processing. this library converts it to plain old text.\n\n## how to use\n```python\nfrom striprtf.striprtf import rtf_to_text\nrtf = \"some rtf encoded string\"\ntext = rtf_to_text(rtf)\nprint(text)\n```\n\nif you want to use a different encoding than `cp1252` you can pass it via the parameter `encoding`. this \nis only taken into account if no explicit codepage has been set. \n```python\nfrom striprtf.striprtf import rtf_to_text\nrtf = \"some rtf encoded string in latin1\"\ntext = rtf_to_text(rtf, encoding=\"latin-1\")\nprint(text)\n```\n\nsometimes unicodedecodingerrors can happen because of various reasons.\nin this case you can try to relax the encoding process like this:\n```python\nfrom striprtf.striprtf import rtf_to_text\nrtf = \"some rtf encoded string\"\ntext = rtf_to_text(rtf, errors=\"ignore\")\nprint(text)\n```\n\n## how to use online\nif you don't want to install, there is also an online version available at https://striprtf.dev which can be used for free. \n\n\n## history\n[pyth](https://github.com/brendonh/pyth) was not working for the rtf files i\nhad. the next best thing was this gist:\nhttps://gist.github.com/gilsondev/7c1d2d753ddb522e7bc22511cfb08676\n\n~~very few additions where made, e.g. better formatting of tables. ~~\n\nin the meantime some encodings bugs have been fixed. :-)\n\n## pushing to pypi\n * pip install twine\n\n\nrun commands\n```\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\ntwine upload -r testpypi dist/*\ntwine upload -r pypi dist/*\n```\n\n\n",
