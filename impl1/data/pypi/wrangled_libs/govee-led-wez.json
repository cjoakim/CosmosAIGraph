  "description": "# control govee led lights from python\n\nthis library provides control over govee-manufactured lights.  @wez built this\nfor use with home assistant. you can [find the corresponding hacs-govee-lan\nrepo here](https://github.com/wez/govee-lan-hass).\n\nit has an emphasis on making use of their [lan\napi](https://app-h5.govee.com/user-manual/wlan-guide) but also makes use of\ntheir [http\napi](https://govee-public.s3.amazonaws.com/developer-docs/goveedeveloperapireference.pdf)\nin order to retrieve the user-assigned names of the devices, and to control the\ndevices that don't yet support the lan api.\n\n## getting started\n\n```python\n\nfrom govee_led_wez import goveecontroller, goveedevice\n\ncontroller = goveecontroller()\n\ndef device_changed(device: goveedevice):\n    print(f\"{device.device_id} state -> {device.state}\")\n\ncontroller.set_device_change_callback(device_changed)\nif your_api_key:\n    controller.set_http_api_key(your_api_key)\n    controller.start_http_poller()\ncontroller.start_lan_poller()\n\nif you_want_ble:\n    # optional, if you want bluetooth device control.\n\n    # this will disconnect from devices after they are idle\n    # for a while. if you omit this, devices will be disconnected\n    # in case of error. you probably want this.\n    controller.start_ble_idler()\n\n    # this will look for new devices in the background,\n    # by default every 10 minutes\n    controller.start_ble_poller()\n\n    # alternatively: this will look for devices right now,\n    # but note that it needs # to perform discovery and can\n    # take several seconds\n    # await controller.query_ble_devices()\n\n# devices will now be discovered asynchronously\n```\n\n## notes\n\n*devices are discovered asynchronously*. while the full set of devices\nassociated with your account can be returned via the http api, the\ninitial request for them is made asynchronously by the background\nhttp poller task.  if you need the list immediately, you can call\n`controller.query_http_devices()` to obtain that list.\n\n*the http api has some tight rate limits*. this library prefers to avoid\nread-after-write operations to verify the state in order to reserve the calls\nfor issuing commands to your devices.  this means that, for devices that don't\nsupport the lan api, the assumed state may be a bit wonky until the device\nis controlled. you can call `controller.update_device_state()` to\nexplicitly retrieve the state.\n\n*ble is preferred over http*. when we know a device is accessible via ble,\nthen we will attempt to control it via ble before trying to use http.\nlan is always attempted first, as it has the lowest latency.\n\n*ble is currently only usable in conjunction with http and/or lan discovery*.\nthere isn't a ble-only usage at the moment.\n\n# contributing\n\na `makefile` provides shortcuts for doing stuff:\n\n* `make setup` - do one-time setup for developing\n* `make check` - performs type checking and linting\n* `make test` - runs tests\n* `make fmt` - runs code formatting, potentially appeasing `make check`\n* `make build` - builds distributable bits\n\ngithub actions will run the `check`, `test` and `build` actions on prs.\n",
