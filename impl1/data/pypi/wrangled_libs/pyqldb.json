[getting started with amazon qldb python driver](https://amazon-qldb-driver-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/getting_started.html) a guide that gets you started with executing transactions with the qldb python driver.\n2. [qldb python driver cookbook](https://amazon-qldb-driver-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/cookbook.html) the cookbook provides code samples for some simple qldb python driver use cases. \n3. [amazon qldb python driver tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.python.tutorial.html): in this tutorial, you use the qldb driver for python to create an amazon qldb ledger and populate it with tables and sample data.\n4. [amazon qldb python driver samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-qldb-dmv-sample-python): a dmv based example application which demonstrates how to use qldb with the qldb driver for python.\n5. qldb python driver accepts and returns [amazon ion](http://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/) documents. amazon ion is a richly-typed, self-describing, hierarchical data serialization format offering interchangeable binary and text representations. for more information read the [ion docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ion-python/).\n6. amazon qldb supports the [partiql](https://partiql.org/) query language. partiql provides sql-compatible query access across multiple data stores containing structured data, semistructured data, and nested data. for more information read the [partiql docs](https://partiql.org/docs.html).\n7. refer the section [common errors while using the amazon qldb drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/driver-errors.html) which describes runtime errors that can be thrown by the amazon qldb driver when calling the qldb-session apis.\n\n## development\n\n### setup\n\nassuming that you have python and `virtualenv` installed, set up your environment and installed the dependencies\nlike this instead of the `pip install pyqldb` defined above:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python\n$ cd amazon-qldb-driver-python\n$ virtualenv venv\n...\n$ . venv/bin/activate\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n```\n\n### running tests\n\nyou can run the unit tests with this command:\n\n```\n$ pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=pyqldb tests/unit\n```\n\nyou can run the integration tests with this command:\n```\n$ pytest tests/integration\n```\n\n### documentation \n\nsphinx is used for documentation. you can generate html locally with the following:\n\n```\n$ pip install -r requirements-docs.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n$ cd docs\n$ make html\n```\n\n## getting help\n\nplease use these community resources for getting help.\n* ask a question on stackoverflow and tag it with the [amazon-qldb](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/amazon-qldb) tag.\n* open a support ticket with [aws support](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html).\n* make a new thread at [aws qldb forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumid=353&start=0).\n* if you think you may have found a bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/new).\n\n## opening issues\n\nif you encounter a bug with the amazon qldb python driver, we would like to hear about it. please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues) and see if others are also experiencing the issue before opening a new issue. when opening a new issue, we will need the version of amazon qldb python driver, python language version, and os you're using. please also include reproduction case for the issue when appropriate.\n\nthe github issues are intended for bug reports and feature requests. for help and questions with using amazon qldb python driver, please make use of the resources listed in the [getting help](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python#getting-help) section. keeping the list of open issues lean will help us respond in a timely manner.\n\n## license\n\nthis library is licensed under the apache 2.0 license.\n",
