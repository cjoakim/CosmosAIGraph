  "description": "=================\naboutcode toolkit\n=================\n\nintroduction\n------------\nthe aboutcode toolkit and about files provide a simple way to document the\norigin, license, usage and other important or interesting information about\nthird-party software components that you use in your project.\n\nyou start by storing about files (a small yaml formatted text file with field/value pairs)\nside-by-side with each of the third-party software components you use.\neach about file documents origin and license for one software.\nthere are many examples of about files (valid or invalid) in the testdata/\ndirectory of the whole repository.\n\nthe current version of the aboutcode toolkit can read these about files so that you\ncan collect and validate the inventory of third-party components that you use.\n\nin addition, this tool is able to generate attribution notices and\nidentify redistributable source code used in your project to help you comply\nwith open source licenses conditions.\n\nthis version of the aboutcode toolkit follows the about specification version 3.3.1 at:\nhttps://aboutcode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html\n\n\nbuild and tests status\n----------------------\n\n+-------+-----------------+--------------+\n|branch | **linux/macos** | **windows**  |\n+=======+=================+==============+\n|master | |master-posix|  | |master-win| |\n+-------+-----------------+--------------+\n|develop| |devel-posix|   | |devel-win|  |\n+-------+-----------------+--------------+\n\n\nrequirements\n------------\nthe aboutcode toolkit is tested with python 3.7 or above only on linux, mac and windows.\nyou will need to install a python interpreter if you do not have one already\ninstalled.\n\non linux and mac, python is typically pre-installed. to verify which\nversion may be pre-installed, open a terminal and type:\n\n    python --version\n\nnote\n~~~~\n    debian has decided that distutils is not a core python package, so it is not included in the last versions of debian and debian-based oses.\n    a solution is to run: `sudo apt install python3-distutils`\n\non windows or mac, you can download the latest python here:\n    https://www.python.org/downloads/\n\ndownload the .msi installer for windows or the .dmg archive for mac.\nopen and run the installer using all the default options.\n\ninstallation\n------------\ncheckout or download and extract the aboutcode toolkit from:\n    https://github.com/nexb/aboutcode-toolkit/\n\nto install all the needed dependencies in a virtualenv, run (on posix):\n    ./configure\nor on windows:\n    configure\n\nactivate the virtualenv\n-----------------------\nto activate the virtualenv, run (on posix):\n    source venv/bin/activate\nor on windows:\n    venv\\\\bin\\\\activate\n\n\ndeactivate the virtualenv\n-------------------------\nto deactivate the virtualenv, run (on both posix and windows):\n    deactivate\n\n\nversioning schema\n-----------------\nstarting at aboutcode version 4.0.0, the aboutcode toolkit will follow semver for the versioning schema.\n\ni.e. major.minor.patch format\n    1. major version when making incompatible api changes,\n    2. minor version when making functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and\n    3. patch version when making backwards compatible bug fixes.\n\n\nreference\n---------\nsee https://aboutcode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for documentation.\n\nsee https://aboutcode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html for reference.\n\ntests and development\n---------------------\nto install all the needed development dependencies, run (on posix):\n    ./configure --dev\nor on windows:\n    configure --dev\n\nto verify that everything works fine you can run the test suite with:\n    pytest\n\n\nclean build and installed files\n-------------------------------\nto clean the built and installed files, run (on posix):\n    ./configure --clean\nor on windows:\n    configure --clean\n\n\nhelp and support\n----------------\nif you have a question or find a bug, enter a ticket at:\n\n    https://github.com/nexb/aboutcode-toolkit\n\nfor issues, you can use:\n\n    https://github.com/nexb/aboutcode-toolkit/issues\n\n\nsource code\n-----------\nthe aboutcode toolkit is available through github. for the latest version visit:\n    https://github.com/nexb/aboutcode-toolkit\n\n\nhacking\n-------\nwe accept pull requests provided under the same license as this tool.\nyou agree to the http://developercertificate.org/\n\n\nlicense\n-------\nthe aboutcode toolkit is released under the apache 2.0 license.\nsee (of course) the about.about file for details.\n\n\n.. |master-posix|
