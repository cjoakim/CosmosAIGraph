  "description": "\npytest-tap is a reporting plugin for pytest that outputs\n`test anything protocol (tap) <http://testanything.org/>`_ data.\ntap is a line based test protocol for recording test data in a standard way.\n\nuse ``pytest --tap`` after installing to get started.\n\nfollow `github <https://github.com/python-tap/pytest-tap>`_\nfor more information or to follow this plugin's development.\nadditional developer documentation about python and tap is on\n`read the docs <https://tappy.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\n\nreleases\n========\n\nversion 3.4, july 15, 2023\n--------------------------\n\n* deprecate ``--tap-stream`` in favor of ``--tap`` for streaming mode.\n* when using xdist, report the plan at the beginning of execution.\n* add support for python 3.11.\n* drop support for python 3.7 (it is end-of-life).\n* drop support for python 3.6 (it is end-of-life).\n* drop support for pypy.\n\nversion 3.3, october 27, 2021\n-----------------------------\n\n* add support for python 3.10.\n* fix bug with help printing when streaming mode is enabled (#59).\n* drop support for python 3.5 (it is end-of-life).\n* remove unmaintained (and likely inaccurate) locale info.\n\nversion 3.2, november 7, 2020\n-----------------------------\n\n* add support for python 3.8.\n* add support for python 3.9.\n* handle ``unittest.expectedfailure`` and ``pytest.xfail``\n  in a way that is more consistent\n  with the tap specification.\n\nversion 3.1, released march 25, 2020\n------------------------------------\n\n* fix reporting that was broken by the removal\n  of a deprecated feature in pytest 5.4.\n\nversion 3.0, released january 28, 2020\n--------------------------------------\n\n* drop support for python 2.\n\nversion 2.5, released december 26, 2019\n---------------------------------------\n\n* last supported version for python 2.\n* pin tap.py to a version range that supports python 2.\n\nversion 2.4, released october 21, 2019\n--------------------------------------\n\n* handle failures that occur from setup.\n  this will catch errors that may happen in fixtures.\n* drop support for python 3.4 (it is end-of-life).\n* add support for python 3.7.\n\nversion 2.3, released september 16, 2018\n----------------------------------------\n\n* improve xfail handling.\n  honor strict xfail mode.\n  use todo instead of skip directive to better align with tap specification.\n* output the plan line (``1..n``) first.\n\nversion 2.2, released january 9, 2018\n-------------------------------------\n\n* update output format to match closer to pytest styling.\n* drop support for python 3.3 (it is end-of-life).\n\nversion 2.1, released august 12, 2017\n-------------------------------------\n\n* add support for python 3.6.\n* fix crash when running with pytest-xdist (#27).\n\nversion 2.0, released august 1, 2016\n------------------------------------\n\n* update to tap.py 2.0.\n  this update drops the indirect dependencies on nose and pygments.\n* improve handling of skips and xfails.\n* suppress ``# tap results for testcase`` for streaming.\n  this header makes little sense for pytest's test function paradigm.\n  including the header generated extra noise for each function.\n* drop support for python 2.6\n\nversion 1.9, released june 11, 2016\n-----------------------------------\n\n* initial release as stand-alone plugin.\n  the version number aligns with tappy.\n",
