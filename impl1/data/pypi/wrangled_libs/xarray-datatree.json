the basic idea is that each tree node wraps a up to a single `xarray.dataset`. the differences are that this effort:\n- uses a node structure inspired by [anytree](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree/issues/7) for the tree,\n- implements path-like getting and setting,\n- has functions for mapping user-supplied functions over every node in the tree,\n- automatically dispatches *some* of `xarray.dataset`'s api over every node in the tree (such as `.isel`),\n- has a bunch of tests,\n- has a printable representation that currently looks like this:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35968931/130657849-577faa00-1b8b-4e33-a45c-4f389ce325b2.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n\n### get started\n\nyou can create a `datatree` object in 3 ways:\n1) load from a netcdf file (or zarr store) that has groups via `open_datatree()`.\n2) using the init method of `datatree`, which creates an individual node.\n  you can then specify the nodes' relationships to one other, either by setting `.parent` and `.children` attributes,\n  or through `__get/setitem__` access, e.g. `dt['path/to/node'] = datatree()`.\n3) create a tree from a dictionary of paths to datasets using `datatree.from_dict()`.\n\n### development roadmap\n\ndatatree currently lives in a separate repository to the main xarray package.\nthis allows the datatree developers to make changes to it, experiment, and improve it faster.\n\neventually we plan to fully integrate datatree upstream into xarray's main codebase, at which point the [github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree>) repository will be archived.\nthis should not cause much disruption to code that depends on datatree - you will likely only have to change the import line (i.e. from ``from datatree import datatree`` to ``from xarray import datatree``).\n\nhowever, until this full integration occurs, datatree's api should not be considered to have the same [level of stability as xarray's](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/contributing.html#backwards-compatibility).\n\n### user feedback\n\nwe really really really want to hear your opinions on datatree!\nat this point in development, user feedback is critical to help us create something that will suit everyone's needs.\nplease raise any thoughts, issues, suggestions or bugs, no matter how small or large, on the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree/issues).\n\n\n[github-ci-badge]: https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/xarray-contrib/datatree/main.yaml?branch=main&label=ci&logo=github\n[github-ci-link]: https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree/actions?query=workflow%3aci\n[codecov-badge]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/xarray-contrib/datatree.svg?logo=codecov\n[codecov-link]: https://codecov.io/gh/xarray-contrib/datatree\n[rtd-badge]: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/xarray-datatree/latest.svg\n[rtd-link]: https://xarray-datatree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n[pypi-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/xarray-datatree?logo=pypi\n[pypi-link]: https://pypi.org/project/xarray-datatree\n[conda-badge]: https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/xarray-datatree?logo=anaconda\n[conda-link]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/xarray-datatree\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/xarray-contrib/datatree\n[repo-link]: https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree\n[pre-commit.ci-badge]: https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/xarray-contrib/datatree/main.svg\n[pre-commit.ci-link]: https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/xarray-contrib/datatree/main\n",
