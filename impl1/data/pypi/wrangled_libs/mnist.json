  "description": "\nthe mnist database is available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\n\nthe mnist database is a dataset of handwritten digits. it has 60,000\ntraining samples, and 10,000 test samples. each image is represented\nby 28x28 pixels, each containing a value 0 - 255 with its grayscale value.\n\nit is a subset of a larger set available from nist. the digits have been\nsize-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.\n\nit is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and\npattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal\nefforts on preprocessing and formatting.\n\nthere are four files available, which contain separately train and test,\nand images and labels.\n\nthanks to yann lecun, corinna cortes, christopher j.c. burges.\n\nmnist makes it easier to download and parse mnist files.\n\n\n",
