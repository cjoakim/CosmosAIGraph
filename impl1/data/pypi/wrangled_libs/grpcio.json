  "description": "grpc python\n===========\n\n|compat_check_pypi|\n\npackage for grpc python.\n\n.. |compat_check_pypi| image:: https://python-compatibility-tools.appspot.com/one_badge_image?package=grpcio\n   :target: https://python-compatibility-tools.appspot.com/one_badge_target?package=grpcio\n\nsupported python versions\n-------------------------\npython >= 3.7\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\ngrpc python is available for linux, macos, and windows.\n\ninstalling from pypi\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nif you are installing locally...\n\n::\n\n  $ pip install grpcio\n\nelse system wide (on ubuntu)...\n\n::\n\n  $ sudo pip install grpcio\n\nif you're on windows make sure that you installed the :code:`pip.exe` component\nwhen you installed python (if not go back and install it!) then invoke:\n\n::\n\n  $ pip.exe install grpcio\n\nwindows users may need to invoke :code:`pip.exe` from a command line ran as\nadministrator.\n\nn.b. on windows and on mac os x one *must* have a recent release of :code:`pip`\nto retrieve the proper wheel from pypi. be sure to upgrade to the latest\nversion!\n\ninstalling from source\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nbuilding from source requires that you have the python headers (usually a\npackage named :code:`python-dev`).\n\n::\n\n  $ export repo_root=grpc  # repo_root can be any directory of your choice\n  $ git clone -b release_tag_here https://github.com/grpc/grpc $repo_root\n  $ cd $repo_root\n  $ git submodule update --init\n\n  # for the next two commands do `sudo pip install` if you get permission-denied errors\n  $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n  $ grpc_python_build_with_cython=1 pip install .\n\nyou cannot currently install python from source on windows. things might work\nout for you in msys2 (follow the linux instructions), but it isn't officially\nsupported at the moment.\n\ntroubleshooting\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nhelp, i ...\n\n* **... see a** :code:`pkg_resources.versionconflict` **when i try to install\n  grpc**\n\n  this is likely because :code:`pip` doesn't own the offending dependency,\n  which in turn is likely because your operating system's package manager owns\n  it. you'll need to force the installation of the dependency:\n\n  :code:`pip install --ignore-installed $offending_dependency`\n\n  for example, if you get an error like the following:\n\n  ::\n\n    traceback (most recent call last):\n    file \"<string>\", line 17, in <module>\n     ...\n    file \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 509, in find\n      raise versionconflict(dist, req)\n    pkg_resources.versionconflict: (six 1.8.0 (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages), requirement.parse('six>=1.10'))\n\n  you can fix it by doing:\n\n  ::\n\n    sudo pip install --ignore-installed six\n\n* **... see the following error on some platforms**\n\n  ::\n\n    /tmp/pip-build-u8pssr/cython/cython/plex/scanners.c:4:20: fatal error: python.h: no such file or directory\n    #include \"python.h\"\n                    ^\n    compilation terminated.\n\n  you can fix it by installing `python-dev` package. i.e\n\n  ::\n\n    sudo apt-get install python-dev\n\n",
