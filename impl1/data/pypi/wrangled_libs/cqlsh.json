  "description": "[![pypi version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cqlsh.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cqlsh)\n![pypi - python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/cqlsh)\n[![downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/cqlsh)](https://pepy.tech/project/cqlsh)\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/apache-2.0)\n\n# `cqlsh`\n\n`cqlsh` is a python-based command-line client for running `cql` commands on a `cassandra` cluster.\n\nnormally it's packaged as part of the full apache cassandra\u2122 installation. this repo repackages it into a standalone python package for lighter-weight installs.\n\n### installing:\n\ninstall and update using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):\n```\n$ pip install -u cqlsh\n```\n\n### running:\n\n```\n$ cqlsh --help\n```\n\n### documentation:\n\ndocumentation is available as part of the official [apache cassandra\u2122 documentation](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/tools/cqlsh.html).\n\n### contributing:\n\nbecause this is a repackaging of `cqlsh` from the official [cassandra repo](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/cassandra.git), **only issues / prs related to pypi packaging should be opened against this repo**. if you would like to contribute to `cqlsh` itself, [find out more information here](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/contributing.md).\n\nsteps to sanity check that the packaging works as expected:\n\n1. install `cqlsh` locally (probably in a `virtualenv`):\n```\n$ pip install -e .  # run from within the cqlsh directory\n```\n2. start a local copy of cassandra:\n```\n$ docker pull cassandra\n$ docker run -it --rm -p 9042:9042 cassandra\n```\n3. verify `cqlsh` successfully connects to the server:\n```\n$ cqlsh\n\nconnected to test cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042\n[cqlsh 6.1.0 | cassandra 4.1.0 | cql spec 3.4.5 | native protocol v5]\nuse help for help.\ncqlsh>\n```\n\nthis pypi package is maintained by [jeff widman](https://github.com/jeffwidman) and [brad schoening](https://github.com/bschoening). previous maintainers: [spiro](https://github.com/spiside) and [andrew mussey](https://github.com/amussey).\n\n\n### changelog:\n\nunfortunately the cassandra project does not always increment the `cqlsh` version number, so for every\nrelease we need to document not only the `cqlsh` version but also the `cassandra` version in which it\nshipped.\n\n#### 6.1.2 (march 24, 2023)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `6.1.0` from [cassandra 4.1.1](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.1.0/bin/cqlsh.py):\n* now supports python 3.11.\n* although this is pulled from a cassandra `4.x` release, it is protocol compatible with cassandra `3.x` clusters, with the exception of describe keywords which require a 4.x cluster.\n\n#### 6.1.1 (skipped due to a versioning issue)\n\n#### 6.1.0 (jan 4, 2023)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `6.1.0` from [cassandra 4.1](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.1.0/bin/cqlsh.py):\n* requires python 3.6+.\n* although this is pulled from a cassandra `4.x` release, it is protocol compatible with cassandra `3.x` clusters, with the exception of describe keywords which require a 4.x cluster.\n\n#### 6.0.1 (jan 18, 2022)\n\nthe actual source code is identical to the `cqlsh` `6.0.0` release, except it's now packaged as\na module. this allows it to be used as a library, not just an executable script. it also provides\nbetter windows support. details in https://github.com/jeffwidman/cqlsh/pull/7 by @bschoening.\n\nnote: this release was yanked from pypi because it [broke python 2 compatibility](https://github.com/jeffwidman/cqlsh/issues/11).\n\n#### 6.0.0 (aug 3, 2021)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `6.0.0` from [cassandra 4.0](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0.0/bin/cqlsh.py):\n* requires python 3.6+ or 2.7 (although support for python 2 is deprecated).\n* although this is pulled from a cassandra `4.x` release, it should generally work against cassandra `3.x` clusters without needing to set any flags.\n\n\n#### 6.0.0b4 (mar 9, 2021)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `5.0.1` from [cassandra 4.0-beta4](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0-beta4/bin/cqlsh.py):\n* now supports python 3.\n* although this is pulled from a cassandra `4.x` release, it should generally work against cassandra `3.x` clusters without needing to set any flags.\n\n#### 5.0.5 (mar 9, 2021)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `5.0.1` from [cassandra 3.11.10](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.11.10/bin/cqlsh.py).\n\n#### 5.0.4 (mar 29, 2017)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `5.0.1` from [cassandra 3.4.0](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.4/bin/cqlsh.py).\n\n\n#### 5.0.3 (mar 21, 2016)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `5.0.1` from [cassandra 2.2.0](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.2.0/bin/cqlsh.py).\n\n\n#### 4.1.1 (feb 11, 2014)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `4.1.1` from [cassandra 2.0.5](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.0.5/bin/cqlsh).\n\n\n#### 4.1.0 (dec 2, 2013)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `4.1.0` from [cassandra 2.0.3](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.0.3/bin/cqlsh).\n\n\n#### 4.0.1 (oct 14, 2013)\n\nthis packages `cqlsh` `4.0.1` from [cassandra 2.0.1](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.0.1/bin/cqlsh).\n",
