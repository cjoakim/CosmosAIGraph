  "description": "# intake: a general interface for loading data\n\n![logo](https://github.com/intake/intake/raw/master/logo-small.png)\n\n[![build status](https://github.com/intake/intake/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/intake/intake/actions)\n[![documentation status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/intake/badge/?version=latest)](http://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n[![join the chat at https://gitter.im/continuumio/intake](https://badges.gitter.im/continuumio/intake.svg)](https://gitter.im/continuumio/intake?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n\nintake is a lightweight set of tools for loading and sharing data in data science projects.\nintake helps you:\n\n* load data from a variety of formats (see the [current list of known plugins](http://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin-directory.html)) into containers you already know, like pandas dataframes, python lists, numpy arrays, and more.\n* convert boilerplate data loading code into reusable intake plugins\n* describe data sets in catalog files for easy reuse and sharing between projects and with others.\n* share catalog information (and data sets) over the network with the intake server\n\ndocumentation is available at [read the docs](http://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest).\n\nweekly news about this repo and other related projects can be found on the\n[wiki](https://github.com/intake/intake/wiki/community-news)\n\ninstall\n-------\n\nrecommended method using conda:\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge intake\n```\n\nyou can also install using `pip`, in which case you have a choice as to how many of the optional\ndependencies you install, with the simplest having least requirements\n\n```bash\npip install intake\n```\n\nand additional sections `[server]`, `[plot]` and `[dataframe]`, or to include everything:\n\n```bash\npip install intake[complete]\n```\n\nnote that you may well need specific drivers and other plugins, which usually have additional\ndependencies of their own.\n\ndevelopment\n-----------\n * create development python environment with the required dependencies, ideally with `conda`.\n   the requirements can be found in the yml files in the `scripts/ci/` directory of this repo.\n   * e.g. `conda env create -f scripts/ci/environment-py38.yml` and then `conda activate test_env`\n * install intake using `pip install -e .[complete]`\n * use `pytest` to run tests.\n * create a fork on github to be able to submit prs.\n * we respect, but do not enforce, pep8 standards; all new code should be covered by tests.\n",
