  "description": "================\npyjavaproperties3\n================\n\n* project hosting: <https://github.com/tgates42/pyjavaproperties/>\n\n.. contents::\n\nabout\n------------------\n\nthis is a \"fork\" of the \"python replacement for java.util.properties\" recipe\non aspn: <http://code.activestate.com/recipes/496795/> and uploaded by \nanand balachandran pillai. \n\nthe project is maintained by jesse noller <jnoller@gmail.com>, anand pilla\n<abpillai@gmail.com>.\n\nlicense\n------------------\nas with all aspn recipes not otherwise licensed prior to july 15, 2008 on\naspn.activestate.com, the original recipe is under psf license. for more\ninformation, see the aspn terms of service here:\n\n<http://code.activestate.com/help/terms/>\n\nwhile the licensing under the psf license is sub-optimal, it is what it is. see\n<http://docs.python.org/license.html> for more information about the psf\nlicense.\n\nwhat this is\n------------------\nthis module is designed to be a python equivalent to the `java.util.properties <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/properties.html>`_ class. \ncurrently, the basic input/output methods are supported, and there are plans \nto add the xml input/output methods found in j2se 5.0.\n\nfundamentally, this module is designed so that users can easily parse and \nmanipulate java properties files - that's it. there's a fair number of us \npythonistas who work in multi-language shops, and constantly writing your own \nparsing mechanism is just painful. not to mention java guys are notoriously \nunwilling to use anything which is cross-language for configuration, unless\nit's xml, which is a form of self-punishment. :)\n\nplans\n------------------\nhere is a rough plan of features:\n\n- keep/maintain blank lines and comments found in the original file\n- make the module compatible with the new methods in j2se 5.0\n- switch to/add python property access rather than direct dictionary get/set\n- add unit tests\n- add unicode support\n- when-pigs-fly: if running within jython, switch to java.util.properties\n  under the hood\n- coercion/conversion to python types for values \n\nusage\n------------------\nthis is the easy part::\n\n    from pyjavaproperties3 import properties\n    p = properties()\n    p.load(open('test2.properties'))\n    p.list()\n    print p\n    print p.items()\n    print p['name3']\n    p['name3'] = 'changed = value'\n    print p['name3']    \n    p['new key'] = 'new value'\n    p.store(open('test2.properties','w'))\n\nsee also the properties.list() method, which will return an iterator over the\nproperty keys\n\nchanges & news\n--------------\n0.6: \n    - fix license, whitespace.\n\n0.4:\n    - patch from pepper lebeck-jobe for handling ! style comments.\n\n0.3:\n    - keys that are added which were not part of the original file\n      are simply appended to the index. shenanigans.\n\n0.2:\n    - added an internal list (self._keyorder) to keep an ordered index of keys\n      as they are encountered, so the file can we written-back out in the \n      same order.\n\n0.1:\n    - initial release/fork. \n    - added setup/packaging and doc \n    - added in {foo} style references for previous properties, thanks to n b\n      on aspn.\n\n",
