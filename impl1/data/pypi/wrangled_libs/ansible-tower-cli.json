tool for ansible tower.\n\nit is also what the ansible `tower_*` modules use under the hood. such as:\n\nhttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/tower_organization_module.html\n\nthese modules are now vendored as part of the awx collection at:\n\nhttps://galaxy.ansible.com/awx/awx\n\nsupporting correct operation of the modules is the maintenance aim of this\npackage.\n\nanyone developing new tooling around awx or ansible tower via a unix command\nline is suggested to use the new cli.\n\nhttps://github.com/ansible/awx/tree/devel/awxkit/awxkit/cli/docs\n\n .. |build status| image::
