  "description": "# ziafont\n\nziafont reads truetype/opentype font files and draws characters and strings as svg <path> elements. unlike the svg <text> element, the output of ziafont's svg will render identically on any system, independent of whether the original font is available.\n\nziafont supports fonts with truetype glyph outlines contained in a \"glyf\" table in the font (these fonts typically have a .ttf extensions), or fonts with a \"cff \" table (typically with a .otf extension). kerning adjustment and glyph substitution are supported if the font has a \"gpos\" table.\n\ndocumentation is available at [readthedocs](https://ziafont.readthedocs.io). there is also an [online demo](https://cdelker.github.io/pyscript/ziafont.html) of glyph rendering using ziafont.\n",
