in streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hlasse/textdescriptives)\n\na python library for calculating a large variety of metrics from text(s) using spacy v.3 pipeline components and extensions. \n\n# \ud83d\udd27 installation\n`pip install textdescriptives`\n\n# \ud83d\udcf0 news\n\n* we now have a textdescriptives-powered web-app so you can extract and downloads metrics without a single line of code! check it out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hlasse/textdescriptives)\n* version 2.0 out with a new api, a new component, updated documentation, and tutorials! components are now called by \"`textdescriptives/{metric_name}`. new `coherence` component for calculating the semantic coherence between sentences. see the [documentation](https://github.com/hlasse/textdescriptives) for tutorials and more information!  \n\n\n\n# \u26a1 quick start\n\nuse `extract_metrics` to quickly extract your desired metrics. to see available methods you can simply run:\n```python\nimport textdescriptives as td\ntd.get_valid_metrics()\n# {'quality', 'readability', 'all', 'descriptive_stats', 'dependency_distance', 'pos_proportions', 'information_theory', 'coherence'}\n```\n\nset the `spacy_model` parameter to specify which spacy model to use, otherwise, textdescriptives will auto-download an appropriate one based on `lang`. if `lang` is set, `spacy_model` is not necessary and vice versa.\n\nspecify which metrics to extract in the `metrics` argument. `none` extracts all metrics. \n\n```py\nimport textdescriptives as td\n\ntext = \"the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth. i smell it in the air. much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.\"\n# will automatically download the relevant model (\u00b4en_core_web_lg\u00b4) and extract all metrics\ndf = td.extract_metrics(text=text, lang=\"en\", metrics=none)\n\n# specify spacy model and which metrics to extract\ndf = td.extract_metrics(text=text, spacy_model=\"en_core_web_lg\", metrics=[\"readability\", \"coherence\"])\n```\n\n\n## usage with spacy\n\nto integrate with other spacy pipelines, import the library and add the component(s) to your pipeline using the standard spacy syntax. available components are *descriptive_stats*, *readability*, *dependency_distance*, *pos_proportions*, *coherence*, and *quality* prefixed with `textdescriptives/`. \n\nif you want to add all components you can use the shorthand `textdescriptives/all`.\n\n```py\nimport spacy\nimport textdescriptives as td\n# load your favourite spacy model (remember to install it first using e.g. `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`)\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\nnlp.add_pipe(\"textdescriptives/all\") \ndoc = nlp(\"the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth. i smell it in the air. much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.\")\n\n# access some of the values\ndoc._.readability\ndoc._.token_length\n```\n\ntextdescriptives includes convenience functions for extracting metrics from a `doc` to a pandas dataframe or a dictionary.\n\n```py\ntd.extract_dict(doc)\ntd.extract_df(doc)\n```\n|      | text                      | first_order_coherence | second_order_coherence | pos_prop_det | pos_prop_noun | pos_prop_aux |
