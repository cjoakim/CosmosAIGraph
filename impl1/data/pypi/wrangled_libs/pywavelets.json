a move supported by the original developer.\nthe repo move doesn't mean that this is a fork - the package continues to be\ndeveloped under the name \"pywavelets\", and released on pypi and github (see\n`this issue <https://github.com/nigma/pywt/issues/13>`_ for the discussion\nwhere that was decided).\n\nall contributions including bug reports, bug fixes, new feature implementations\nand documentation improvements are welcome.  moreover, developers with an\ninterest in pywavelets are very welcome to join the development team!\n\nas of 2019, pywavelets development is supported in part by tidelift.\n`help support pywavelets with the tidelift subscription <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pywavelets?utm_source=pypi-pywavelets&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme>`_\n\n\ncontact\n-------\n\nuse `github issues`_ or the `mailing list`_ to post your comments or questions.\n\n**report a security vulnerability:** https://tidelift.com/security\n\nlicense\n-------\n\npywavelets is a free open source software released under the mit license.\n\nif you wish to cite pywavelets in a publication, please use the following\njoss publication.\n\n.. image:: http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01237/status.svg\n   :target: https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01237\n\nspecific releases can also be cited via zenodo. the doi below will correspond\nto the most recent release. dois for past versions can be found by following\nthe link in the badge below to zenodo:\n\n.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1407171.svg\n   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1407171\n\n.. _built-in wavelet filters: http://wavelets.pybytes.com/\n.. _cython: http://cython.org/\n.. _demo: https://github.com/pywavelets/pywt/tree/master/demo\n.. _anaconda: https://www.continuum.io\n.. _github: https://github.com/pywavelets/pywt\n.. _github issues: https://github.com/pywavelets/pywt/issues\n.. _numpy: https://www.numpy.org\n.. _scipy: https://www.scipy.org\n.. _original developer: http://en.ig.ma\n.. _python: http://python.org/\n.. _python package index: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywavelets/\n.. _mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/pywavelets\n.. _releases page: https://github.com/pywavelets/pywt/releases\n.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org\n",
