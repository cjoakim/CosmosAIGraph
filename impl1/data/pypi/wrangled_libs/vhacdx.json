  "description": "# vhacdx\npython bindings for v-hacd\n\na very simple and raw python binding for [v-hacd](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd) that is forked from [thomwolf/pyvhacd](https://github.com/thomwolf/pyvhacd) which generates an approximate convex decomposition of a triangle mesh.\n\ncontains a single method: `output = compute_vhacd(points, faces)` which take as inputs:\n- points: a (n, 3) numpy array of double containing the coordinates of the n vertex of the mesh\n- face: a (m,) numpy array of uint32 containing the face vertxe indices were m is 3 times the number of faces\n\ngives as output a list (number of convex hulls) of pairs of points-faces for each convex hull.\n\n# to install\n```\npip install vhacdx\n```\n",
