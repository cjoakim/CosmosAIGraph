https://travis-ci.org/jazzband/django-sortedm2m.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/jazzband/django-sortedm2m\n   :alt: build status\n\n.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/jazzband/django-sortedm2m/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/jazzband/django-sortedm2m\n   :alt: code coverage\n\n``sortedm2m`` is a drop-in replacement for django's own ``manytomanyfield``.\nthe provided ``sortedmanytomanyfield`` behaves like the original one but\nremembers the order of added relations.\n\nuse cases\n=========\n\nimagine that you have a gallery model and a photo model. usually you want a\nrelation between these models so you can add multiple photos to one gallery\nbut also want to be able to have the same photo on many galleries.\n\nthis is where you usually can use many to many relation. the downside is that\ndjango's default implementation doesn't provide a way to order the photos in\nthe gallery. so you only have a random ordering which is not suitable in most\ncases.\n\nyou can work around this limitation by using the ``sortedmanytomanyfield``\nprovided by this package as drop in replacement for django's\n``manytomanyfield``.\n\nrequirements\n============\n\n**django-sortedm2m** runs on python 3.6+ and django from 2.1 to 3.0.\n\nusage\n=====\n\nuse ``sortedmanytomanyfield`` like ``manytomanyfield`` in your models::\n\n    from django.db import models\n    from sortedm2m.fields import sortedmanytomanyfield\n\n    class photo(models.model):\n        name = models.charfield(max_length=50)\n        image = models.imagefield(upload_to='...')\n\n    class gallery(models.model):\n        name = models.charfield(max_length=50)\n        photos = sortedmanytomanyfield(photo)\n\nif you use the relation in your code like the following, it will remember the\norder in which you have added photos to the gallery. ::\n\n    gallery = gallery.objects.create(name='photos ordered by name')\n    for photo in photo.objects.order_by('name'):\n        gallery.photos.add(photo)\n\n``sortedmanytomanyfield``\n-------------------------\n\nyou can use the following arguments to modify the default behavior:\n\n``sorted``\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**default:** ``true``\n\nyou can set the ``sorted`` to ``false`` which will force the\n``sortedmanytomanyfield`` in behaving like django's original\n``manytomanyfield``. no ordering will be performed on relation nor will the\nintermediate table have a database field for storing ordering information.\n\n``sort_value_field_name``\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**default:** ``'sort_value'``\n\nspecifies how the field is called in the intermediate database table by which\nthe relationship is ordered. you can change its name if you have a legacy\ndatabase that you need to integrate into your application.\n\n``base_class``\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**default:** ``none``\n\nyou can set the ``base_class``, which is the base class of the through model of\nthe sortedm2m relationship between models to an abstract base class containing\na ``__str__`` method to improve the string representations of sortedm2m\nrelationships.\n\n.. note::\n\n    you also could use it to add additional fields to the through model. but\n    please beware: these fields will not be created or modified by an\n    automatically created migration. you will need to take care of migrations\n    yourself. in most cases when you want to add another field, consider\n    *not* using sortedm2m but use a ordinary django manytomanyfield and\n    specify `your own through model`_.\n\n.. _your own through model: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.manytomanyfield.through\n\nmigrating a ``manytomanyfield`` to be a ``sortedmanytomanyfield``\n=================================================================\n\nif you are using django's migration framework and want to change a\n``manytomanyfield`` to be a ``sortedmanytomanyfield`` (or the other way\naround), you will find that a migration created by django's ``makemigrations``\nwill not work as expected.\n\nin order to migrate a ``manytomanyfield`` to a ``sortedmanytomanyfield``, you\nchange the field in your models to be a ``sortedmanytomanyfield`` as\nappropriate and create a new migration with ``manage.py makemigrations``.\nbefore applying it, edit the migration file and change in the ``operations``\nlist ``migrations.alterfield`` to ``altersortedmanytomanyfield`` (import it\nfrom ``sortedm2m.operations``).  this operation will take care of changing the\nintermediate tables, add the ordering field and fill in default values.\n\nadmin\n=====\n\n``sortedmanytomanyfield`` provides a custom widget which can be used to sort\nthe selected items. it renders a list of checkboxes that can be sorted by\ndrag'n'drop.\n\nto use the widget in the admin you need to add ``sortedm2m`` to your\ninstalled_apps settings, like::\n\n   installed_apps = (\n       'django.contrib.auth',\n       'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n       'django.contrib.sessions',\n       'django.contrib.sites',\n       'django.contrib.messages',\n       'django.contrib.staticfiles',\n       'django.contrib.admin',\n\n       'sortedm2m',\n\n       '...',\n   )\n\notherwise it will not find the css and js files needed to sort by drag'n'drop.\n\nfinally, make sure *not* to have the model listed in any ``filter_horizontal``\nor ``filter_vertical`` tuples inside of your ``modeladmin`` definitions.\n\nif you did it right, you'll wind up with something like this:\n\n.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/hjiw7mi.jpg\n\nit's also possible to use the ``sortedmanytomanyfield`` with admin's\n``raw_id_fields`` option in the ``modeladmin`` definition. add the name of the\n``sortedmanytomanyfield`` to this list to get a simple text input field. the\norder in which the ids are entered into the input box is used to sort the\nitems of the sorted m2m relation.\n\nexample::\n\n    from django.contrib import admin\n\n    class galleryadmin(admin.modeladmin):\n        raw_id_fields = ('photos',)\n\ncontribute\n==========\nthis is a `jazzband <https://jazzband.co>`_ project. by contributing you agree to abide by the\n`contributor code of conduct <https://jazzband.co/about/conduct>`_ and follow the\n`guidelines <https://jazzband.co/about/guidelines>`_.\n\nyou can find the latest development version on github_. get there and fork it, file bugs or send well wishes.\n\n.. _github: http://github.com/jazzband/django-sortedm2m\n\nrunning the tests\n-----------------\n\ni recommend to use ``tox`` to run the tests for all relevant python versions\nall at once. therefore install ``tox`` with ``pip install tox``, then type in\nthe root directory of the ``django-sortedm2m`` checkout::\n\n   tox\n\nthe tests are run against sqlite, then against postgresql, then against mysql -\nso you need to install postgresql and mysql on your dev environment, and should\nhave a role/user ``sortedm2m`` set up for both postgresql and mysql.\n\ncode quality\n------------\nthis project uses `isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort>`_, `pycodestyle <https://github.com/pycqa/pycodestyle>`_,\nand `pylint <https://www.pylint.org>`_ to manage validate code quality. these validations can be run with the\nfollowing command::\n\n   tox -e quality\n\n\nchangelog\n=========\n\n3.1.1\n-----\n* `#191`_: fixed js bug for popup in django admin\n\n.. _#191:

implementation.\n\n0.10.0\n------\n\n* the creation of the sortedm2m intermediate model and database table is now\n  fully done inside of the ``sortedmanytomanyfield`` class. that makes it much\n  easier to modify the creation of this when creating a custom subclass of this\n  field. see `#49`_ for an example usecase.\n* adding support for the custom field arguments like ``sorted`` and\n  ``sort_value_field_name`` in django 1.7 migrations. thanks to christian\n  kohlstedde for the patch.\n\n.. _#49: https://github.com/jazzband/django-sortedm2m/issues/49\n\n0.9.5\n-----\n\n* fixing ``setup.py`` when run on a system that does not use utf-8 as default\n  encoding. see `#48`_ for details. thanks to richard mitchell for the patch.\n\n.. _#48: https://github.com/jazzband/django-sortedm2m/pull/48\n\n0.9.4\n-----\n\n* fix: ``sortedmultiplechoicefield`` did not properly report changes of the\n  data to ``form.changed_data``. thanks to @smcoll for the patch.\n\n0.9.3\n-----\n\n* fix: ``altersortedmanytomanyfield`` operation failed for postgres databases.\n* testing against mysql databases.\n\n0.9.2\n-----\n\n* fix: ``altersortedmanytomanyfield`` operation failed for many to many fields\n  which already contained some data.\n\n0.9.1\n-----\n\n* fix: when using the sortable admin widget, deselecting an item in the list\n  had not effect. thank you to madeng84 for the report and patch!\n\n0.9.0\n-----\n\n* adding ``altersortedmanytomanyfield`` migration operation that allows you to\n  migrate from ``manytomanyfield`` to ``sortedmanytomanyfield`` and vice\n  versa. thanks to joaqu\u00edn p\u00e9rez for the patch!\n* fix: supporting migrations in django 1.7.4.\n* fix: the admin widget is not broken anymore for dynamically added inline\n  forms. thanks to rub\u00e9n d\u00edaz for the patch!\n\n0.8.1\n-----\n\n* adding support for django 1.7 migrations. thanks to patryk hes and richard\n  barran for their reports.\n* adding czech translations. thanks to @cuchac for the pull request.\n\n0.8.0\n-----\n\n* adding support for django 1.7 and dropping support for django 1.4.\n\n0.7.0\n-----\n\n* adding support for ``prefetch_related()``. thanks to marcin ossowski for\n  the idea and patch.\n\n0.6.1\n-----\n\n* correct escaping of *for* attribute in label for the sortedm2m widget. thanks\n  to mystic-mirage for the report and fix.\n\n0.6.0\n-----\n\n* python 3 support!\n* better widget. thanks to mike knoop for the initial patch.\n\n0.5.0\n-----\n\n* django 1.5 support. thanks to antti kaihola for the patches.\n* dropping django 1.3 support. please use django-sortedm2m<0.5 if you need to\n  use django 1.3.\n* adding support for a ``sort_value_field_name`` argument in\n  ``sortedmanytomanyfield``. thanks to trey hunner for the idea.\n\n0.4.0\n-----\n\n* django 1.4 support. thanks to flavio curella for the patch.\n* south support is only enabled if south is actually in your installed_apps\n  setting. thanks to tcmb for the report and florian ilgenfritz for the patch.\n\n0.3.3\n-----\n\n* south support (via monkeypatching, but anyway... it's there!). thanks to\n  chris church for the patch. south migrations won't pick up a changed\n  ``sorted`` argument though.\n\n0.3.2\n-----\n\n* use already included jquery version in global scope and don't override with\n  django's version. thank you to hendrik van der linde for reporting this\n  issue.\n\n0.3.1\n-----\n\n* fixed packaging error.\n\n0.3.0\n-----\n\n* heavy internal refactorings. these were necessary to solve a problem with\n  ``sortedmanytomanyfield`` and a reference to ``'self'``.\n\n0.2.5\n-----\n\n* forgot to exclude debug print/console.log statements from code. sorry.\n\n0.2.4\n-----\n\n* fixing problems with ``sortedcheckboxselectmultiple`` widget, especially in\n  admin where a \"create and add another item\" popup is available.\n\n0.2.3\n-----\n\n* fixing issue with primary keys instead of model instances for ``.add()`` and\n  ``.remove()`` methods in ``sortedrelatedmanager``.\n\n0.2.2\n-----\n\n* fixing validation error for ``sortedcheckboxselectmultiple``. it caused\n  errors if only one value was passed.\n\n0.2.1\n-----\n\n* removed unnecessary reference of jquery ui css file in\n  ``sortedcheckboxselectmultiple``. thanks to klaas van schelven and yuwei yu\n  for the hint.\n\n0.2.0\n-----\n\n* added a widget for use in admin.\n\n\n",
