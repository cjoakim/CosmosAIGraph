  "description": "sshuttle: where transparent proxy meets vpn meets ssh\n=====================================================\n\nas far as i know, sshuttle is the only program that solves the following\ncommon case:\n\n- your client machine (or router) is linux, freebsd, or macos.\n\n- you have access to a remote network via ssh.\n\n- you don't necessarily have admin access on the remote network.\n\n- the remote network has no vpn, or only stupid/complex vpn\n  protocols (ipsec, pptp, etc). or maybe you *are* the\n  admin and you just got frustrated with the awful state of\n  vpn tools.\n\n- you don't want to create an ssh port forward for every\n  single host/port on the remote network.\n\n- you hate openssh's port forwarding because it's randomly\n  slow and/or stupid.\n\n- you can't use openssh's permittunnel feature because\n  it's disabled by default on openssh servers; plus it does\n  tcp-over-tcp, which has `terrible performance`_.\n\n.. _terrible performance: https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-it-works.html\n\nobtaining sshuttle\n------------------\n\n- ubuntu 16.04 or later::\n\n      apt-get install sshuttle\n\n- debian stretch or later::\n\n      apt-get install sshuttle\n\n- arch linux::\n\n      pacman -s sshuttle\n\n- fedora::\n\n      dnf install sshuttle\n\n- opensuse::\n\n      zypper in sshuttle\n\n- gentoo::\n\n      emerge -av net-proxy/sshuttle\n\n- nixos::\n\n      nix-env -ia nixos.sshuttle\n\n- from pypi::\n\n      sudo pip install sshuttle\n\n- clone::\n\n      git clone https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle.git\n      cd sshuttle\n      sudo ./setup.py install\n\n- freebsd::\n\n      # ports\n      cd /usr/ports/net/py-sshuttle && make install clean\n      # pkg\n      pkg install py36-sshuttle\n\n- macos, via macports::\n\n      sudo port selfupdate\n      sudo port install sshuttle\n\nit is also possible to install into a virtualenv as a non-root user.\n\n- from pypi::\n\n      virtualenv -p python3 /tmp/sshuttle\n      . /tmp/sshuttle/bin/activate\n      pip install sshuttle\n\n- clone::\n\n      virtualenv -p python3 /tmp/sshuttle\n      . /tmp/sshuttle/bin/activate\n      git clone https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle.git\n      cd sshuttle\n      ./setup.py install\n\n- homebrew::\n\n      brew install sshuttle\n\n- nix::\n\n      nix-env -ia nixpkgs.sshuttle\n\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\nthe documentation for the stable version is available at:\nhttps://sshuttle.readthedocs.org/\n\nthe documentation for the latest development version is available at:\nhttps://sshuttle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\n\nrunning as a service\n--------------------\nsshuttle can also be run as a service and configured using a config management system:\nhttps://medium.com/@mike.reider/using-sshuttle-as-a-service-bec2684a65fe\n\n\n",
