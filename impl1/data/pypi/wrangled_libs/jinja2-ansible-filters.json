  "description": "# jinja2 ansible filters\n\n## overview\n\njinja2 ansible filters is a port of the ansible filters provided by ansible's templating engine.\n\nthis repository is not inteded to supplant ansible functionality however there are a lot of filters ansible provides that are not present in upstream jinja2 so you may find these helpful.\n\n### included filters\n\n- b64decode\n- b64encode\n- basename\n- bool\n- checksum\n- comment\n- dirname\n- expanduser\n- expandvars\n- extract\n- fileglob\n- flatten\n- from_json\n- from_yaml\n- from_yaml_all\n- ans_groupby\n- hash\n- mandatory\n- md5\n- quote\n- ans_random\n- random_mac\n- realpath\n- regex_escape\n- regex_findall\n- regex_replace\n- regex_search\n- relpath\n- sha1\n- shuffle\n- splitext\n- strftime\n- subelements\n- ternary\n- to_datetime\n- to_json\n- to_nice_json\n- to_nice_yaml\n- to_uuid\n- to_yaml\n- type_debug\n- win_basename\n- win_dirname\n- win_splitdrive\n\n### renamed filters\n\ndue to naming conflicts with jinja2 builtin filters, these filters have been prefixed with ans_\n\n- groupby\n- random\n\nso:\n\n- ans_groupby\n- ans_random\n\nadditionally any filter naming collisions detected at runtime will be renamed to ans_filter and a warning message raised for each.\n\nseveral heavy filters have been omitted due to their extensive dependency on ansible core:\n\n### excluded filters\n\n- combine\n- get_encrypted_password\n- dict2items\n- items2dict\n\n## install\n\n`pip install jinja2-ansible-filters`\n\n## usage\n\n### typical usage with jinja2\n\n```python\n  from jinja2 import environment\n\n...\n  env = environment(extensions=['jinja2_ansible_filters.ansiblecorefiltersextension'])\n...\n# or\n  from jinja2_ansible_filters import ansiblecorefiltersextension\n  env = environment(extensions=[ansiblecorefiltersextension])\n...\n```\n\n### include into cookiecutter\n\ncookiecutter.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_extensions\": [\"jinja2_ansible_filters.ansiblecorefiltersextension\"]\n}\n```\n\n## license\n\ndue to multiple licenses in the ansible source the licenses have both been included in license as well as proper attribution. additionally license stubs where preserved with the source files they covered in the origional ansible repository.\n\n##
