a full list is available on the\n  `w3 spec repository`_. the `mdn article`_ is also worth reading.\n* values as lists of strings, where each string is either an origin, e.g.\n  ``'https://example.com'``, or of the special values ``'self'`` or ``'*'``. if\n  there is just one value, no containing list is necessary. to represent no\n  origins being allowed, use an empty list.\n\n  note that in the header, domains are wrapped in double quotes - do not\n  include these quotes within your python string, as they will be added by the\n  middleware.\n\n.. _w3 spec repository: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/blob/master/features.md\n.. _mdn article: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/http/feature_policy#browser_compatibility\n\nif the keys or values are invalid, ``improperlyconfigured`` will be raised at instantiation time, or when processing a response.\nthe current feature list is pulled from the javascript api with ``document.featurepolicy.allowedfeatures()`` on chrome and firefox.\nbrowsers don\u2019t always recognize all features, depending on the version and configuration.\nyou may see warnings in the console for unavailable features in the header - these are normally safe to ignore, since django-permissions-policy already validates that you don\u2019t have completely unknown names.\n\nfor backwards compatibility with old configuration, the value ``'none'`` is\nsupported in lists, but ignored - it's preferable to use the empty list\ninstead. it doesn't make sense to specify ``'none'`` alongside other values.\n\nexamples\n~~~~~~~~\n\ndisable geolocation entirely, for the current origin and any iframes:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    permissions_policy = {\n        \"geolocation\": [],\n    }\n\nallow autoplay from only the current origin and iframes from\n``https://archive.org``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    permissions_policy = {\n        \"autoplay\": [\"self\", \"https://archive.org\"],\n    }\n\nallow autoplay from all origins:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    permissions_policy = {\n        \"autoplay\": \"*\",\n    }\n",
