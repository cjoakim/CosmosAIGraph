  "description": "# easypost python client library\n\n[![ci](https://github.com/easypost/easypost-python/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/easypost/easypost-python/actions?query=workflow%3aci)\n[![coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/easypost/easypost-python/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/easypost/easypost-python)\n[![pypi version](https://badge.fury.io/py/easypost.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/easypost)\n\neasypost, the simple shipping solution. you can sign up for an account at <https://easypost.com>.\n\n## install\n\nthe library is tested against python3 and should be compatible with pypy3.\n\n```bash\npip install easypost\n```\n\n```python\n# import the easypost library:\nimport easypost\n```\n\n## usage\n\na simple create & buy shipment example:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport easypost\n\nclient = easypost.easypostclient(os.getenv('easypost_api_key'))\n\nshipment = client.shipment.create(\n    from_address = {\n        \"name\": \"easypost\",\n        \"street1\": \"118 2nd street\",\n        \"street2\": \"4th floor\",\n        \"city\": \"san francisco\",\n        \"state\": \"ca\",\n        \"zip\": \"94105\",\n        \"country\": \"us\",\n        \"phone\": \"415-456-7890\",\n    },\n    to_address = {\n        \"name\": \"dr. steve brule\",\n        \"street1\": \"179 n harbor dr\",\n        \"city\": \"redondo beach\",\n        \"state\": \"ca\",\n        \"zip\": \"90277\",\n        \"country\": \"us\",\n        \"phone\": \"310-808-5243\",\n    },\n    parcel = {\n        \"length\": 10.2,\n        \"width\": 7.8,\n        \"height\": 4.3,\n        \"weight\": 21.2,\n    },\n)\n\nbought_shipment = client.shipment.buy(shipment.id, rate=shipment.lowest_rate())\n\nprint(bought_shipment)\n```\n\n### http hooks\n\nusers can subscribe to http requests and responses via the `requesthook` and `responsehook` objects. to do so, pass a function to the `subscribe_to_request_hook` or `subscribe_to_response_hook` methods of an `easypostclient` object:\n\n```python\ndef custom_function(**kwargs):\n    \"\"\"pass your code here, data about the request/response is contained within `kwargs`.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"received a request with the status code of: {kwargs.get('http_status')}\")\n\nclient = easypost.easypostclient(os.getenv('easypost_api_key'))\n\nclient.subscribe_to_response_hook(custom_function)\n\n# make your api calls here, your custom_function will trigger once a response is received\n```\n\nyou can also unsubscribe your functions in a similar manner by using the `unsubscribe_from_request_hook` and `unsubscribe_from_response_hook` methods of a client object.\n\n## documentation\n\napi documentation can be found at: <https://easypost.com/docs/api>.\n\nlibrary documentation can be found on the web at: <https://easypost.github.io/easypost-python/> or by building them locally via the `make docs` command.\n\nupgrading major versions of this project? refer to the [upgrade guide](upgrade_guide.md).\n\n## support\n\nnew features and bug fixes are released on the latest major release of this library. if you are on an older major release of this library, we recommend upgrading to the most recent release to take advantage of new features, bug fixes, and security patches. older versions of this library will continue to work and be available as long as the api version they are tied to remains active; however, they will not receive updates and are considered eol.\n\nfor additional support, see our [org-wide support policy](https://github.com/easypost/.github/blob/main/support.md).\n\n## development\n\n```bash\n# install dependencies\nmake install\n\n# lint project\nmake lint\nmake lint-fix\n\n# run tests\neasypost_test_api_key=123... easypost_prod_api_key=123... make test\neasypost_test_api_key=123... easypost_prod_api_key=123... make coverage\n\n# run security analysis\nmake scan\n\n# generate library documentation\nmake docs\n\n# update submodules\nmake update-examples-submodule\n```\n\n### testing\n\nthe test suite in this project was specifically built to produce consistent results on every run, regardless of when they run or who is running them. this project uses [vcr](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy) to record and replay http requests and responses via \"cassettes\". when the suite is run, the http requests and responses for each test function will be saved to a cassette if they do not exist already and replayed from this saved file if they do, which saves the need to make live api calls on every test run. if you receive errors about a cassette expiring, delete and re-record the cassette to ensure the data is up-to-date.\n\n**sensitive data:** we've made every attempt to include scrubbers for sensitive data when recording cassettes so that pii or sensitive info does not persist in version control; however, please ensure when recording or re-recording cassettes that prior to committing your changes, no pii or sensitive information gets persisted by inspecting the cassette.\n\n**making changes:** if you make an addition to this project, the request/response will get recorded automatically for you if the `@pytest.mark.vcr()` decorator is included on the test function. when making changes to this project, you'll need to re-record the associated cassette to force a new live api call for that test which will then record the request/response used on the next run.\n\n**test data:** the test suite has been populated with various helpful fixtures that are available for use, each completely independent from a particular user **with the exception of the usps carrier account id** (see [unit test api keys](#unit-test-api-keys) for more information) which has a fallback value of our internal testing user's id. some fixtures use hard-coded dates that may need to be incremented if cassettes get re-recorded (such as reports or pickups).\n\n#### unit test api keys\n\nthe following are required on every test run:\n\n- `easypost_test_api_key`\n- `easypost_prod_api_key`\n\nsome tests may require an easypost user with a particular set of enabled features such as a `partner` user when creating referrals. we have attempted to call out these functions in their respective docstrings. the following are required when you need to re-record cassettes for applicable tests:\n\n- `usps_carrier_account_id` (eg: one-call buying a shipment for non-easypost employees)\n- `partner_user_prod_api_key` (eg: creating a referral user)\n- `referral_customer_prod_api_key` (eg: adding a credit card to a referral user)\n\n#### google cloud sdk\n\nto run the test suite with the google cloud sdk (`urlfetch` instead of the `requests` library), you'll need the following:\n\n1. install the appengine python package to this virtual environment: `venv/bin/pip install appengine-python-standard`\n1. install the google cloud sdk\n   - [direct download](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)\n   - [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/google-cloud-sdk)\n1. point the `pythonpath` environment variable to the path of the newly installed `google-cloud-sdk` directory. for homebrew, this is `\"$(brew --prefix)/share/google-cloud-sdk\"`\n1. run the test suite with the commands listed in this readme\n",
