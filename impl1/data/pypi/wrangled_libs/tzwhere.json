  "description": "pytzwhere [![build status](https://travis-ci.org/pegler/pytzwhere.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pegler/pytzwhere) [![coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/pegler/pytzwhere/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/pegler/pytzwhere)\n=========\n\npytzwhere is a python library to lookup the timezone for a given lat/lng entirely offline. \n\nversion 3.0 fixes how `pytzwhere` deals with [holes](https://github.com/pegler/pytzwhere/issues/34) in timezones. it is recommended that you use version 3.0.\n\nit is a port from https://github.com/mattbornski/tzwhere with a few improvements. the underlying timezone data is based on work done by [eric muller](http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/)\n\nif used as a library, basic usage is as follows:\n\n    >>> from tzwhere import tzwhere\n    >>> tz = tzwhere.tzwhere()\n    >>> print tz.tznameat(35.29, -89.66)\n    america/chicago\n\nthe polygons used for building the timezones are based on vmap0. sometimes points are outside a vmap0 polygon, but are clearly within a certain timezone (see also this [discussion](https://github.com/mattbornski/tzwhere/issues/8)). as a solution you can search for the closest timezone within a user defined radius.\n\n\n\ndependencies:\n\n  * `numpy` (optional)\n\n  * `shapely`\n",
