(#28)\n  this should help make errors more transparent.\n  - thanks to @mpeteuil for the pull request\n\n1.0.5 (2017-05-29)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n* fix bug in readme example. (#22)\n  - thanks to @tantale for the bug report\n* allow ``none`` as quotechar when using ``quote_none``. (#23)\n  - thanks to @thanatos for the bug report\n\n1.0.4 (2017-02-17)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n* return write value from writerow. (#20)\n  - thanks to @therg\n\n1.0.3 (2017-01-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n* add license file (#18).\n\n1.0.2 (2016-09-15)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n* avoid quoting any numeric types when using ``quote_nonnumeric``.\n  - thanks to @torfsen for the bug report\n\n1.0.1 (2016-02-11)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n* better error messages for invalid dialects.\n  - thanks to @kengruven for the bug report\n\n\n1.0 (2016-02-11)\n++++++++++++++++\n\n* initial release\n\n\n",
