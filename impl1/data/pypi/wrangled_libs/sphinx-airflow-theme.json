(optional) double-check your modifications to the sphinx theme are in the `whl` file:\n    ```shell script\n    pip install wheel\n    wheel unpack ./sphinx_airflow_theme-0.0.11-py3-none-any.whl\n    ```\n\n4. copy the `whl` file to `files` directory in `airflow` repository:\n    ```shell script\n    cp ./sphinx_airflow_theme-0.0.11-py3-none-any.whl ${airflow_repo}/files/\n    ```\n\n5. in `airflow` repository, initiate a new breeze environment:\n    ```shell script\n    breeze\n    ```\n\n6. in the breeze container, generate the documentation after installing the theme:\n    ```shell script\n    pip install /files/sphinx_airflow_theme-0.0.11-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall\n    # generate airflow documentation only. if you need to generate the whole documentation (all providers),\n    # you can do it using `/opt/airflow/scripts/in_container/run_docs_build.sh`. it takes longer to execute.\n    /opt/airflow/scripts/in_container/run_docs_build.sh --package-filter apache-airflow\n    ```\n\n7. verify the documentation generated is correct and includes your modifications. the documentation is generated in\n`docs/_build/docs/`. if you generated airflow documentation only, you can check the results in\n`docs/_build/docs/apache-airflow/latest/`.\n\n\n\n# install developer version\n\nto install the latest development version of a theme, run:\n```shell script\ntheme_version=\"$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow-site/releases/latest | grep '\"tag_name\":' | cut -d '\"' -f 4)\"\npip install \"https://github.com/apache/airflow-site/releases/download/${theme_version}/sphinx_airflow_theme-${theme_version}-py3-none-any.whl\"\n```\npython packages for your prs is available as downloadable artifact in github actions after\nthe ci builds your pr.\n\n# configuration\n\na theme that supports the following configuration options under the `html_theme_options` dict in your projects `conf.py`:\n\n## `navbar_links`\n\nthe list of links that should be available in the navigation bar at the top of the pages. the order of items will not be changed.\n\n**example values:**\n```python\nhtml_theme_options = {\n    'navbar_links': [\n        {'href': '/docs/', 'text': 'documentation'}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n(this is the default)\n\n## `hide_website_buttons`\n\nif ``true``, all links on the same domain but not pointing to this theme's page (e.g. `/community/`) will be hidden.\n\n**example values:**\n```python\nhtml_theme_options = {\n  'hide_website_buttons': false,\n}\n```\n\n## `sidebar_collapse`\n## `sidebar_includehidden`\n\ncontrols the toc display in the sidebar. see https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/templating.html#toctree for more info\n\n# theme's source files\n\n - `<root directory>/sphinx_airflow_theme/sphinx_airflow_theme` - html files\n - `<root directory>/landing-pages/site/assets/scss` - scss files\n - `<root directory>/landing-pages/src/js` - javascript files. if you create a new js file, **don't forget to include it\n  in** `<root directory>/landing-pages/src/docs-index.js\n\n\n",
