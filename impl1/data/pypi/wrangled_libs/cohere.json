  "description": "![ci badge](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-python/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)\n![version badge](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cohere)\n![license badge](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cohere-ai/cohere-python)\n\n# cohere python sdk\n\nthis package provides functionality developed to simplify interfacing with the [cohere api](https://docs.cohere.ai/) in python 3.\n\n## documentation\n\n* sdk documentation can be found [here](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/about).\n  * you can build sdk documentation locally using `cd docs; make clean html`.\n* for more details on advanced parameters, you can also consult the [api documentation](https://docs.cohere.com).\n* see the [examples](examples/) directory for examples, including  some additional functionality for visualizations in jupyter notebooks.\n\n## installation\n\nthe package can be installed with `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade cohere\n```\n\ninstall from source:\n\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\n### requirements\n\n- python 3.8+\n\n## quick start\n\nto use this library, you must have an api key and specify it as a string when creating the `cohere.client` object. api keys can be created through the [platform](https://dashboard.cohere.com/). this is a basic example of the creating the client and using the `generate` endpoint.\n\n```python\nimport cohere\n\n# initialize the cohere client with an api key\nco = cohere.client('your_api_key')\n\n# generate a prediction for a prompt\nprediction = co.chat(message='howdy! \ud83e\udd20', model='command')\n\n# print the predicted text\nprint(f'chatbot: {prediction.text}')\n```\n\nthere is also an asyncio compatible client called `cohere.asyncclient` with an equivalent interface. consult the [sdk docs](https://cohere-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.\n\n## versioning\n\neach sdk release is only compatible with the latest version of the cohere api at the time of release. to use the sdk with an older api version, you need to download a version of the sdk tied to the api version you want. look at the [changelog](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-python/blob/main/changelog.md) to see which sdk version to download.\n\n\n## endpoints\n\nfor a full breakdown of endpoints and arguments, please consult the [sdk docs](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/about) and [cohere docs](https://docs.cohere.com/).\n\n| cohere endpoint  | function             |\n| ---------------- | -------------------- |\n| /chat            | co.chat()            |\n| /generate        | co.generate()        |\n| /embed           | co.embed()           |\n| /rerank          | co.rerank()          |\n| /classify        | co.classify()        |\n| /tokenize        | co.tokenize()        |\n| /detokenize      | co.detokenize()      |\n| /detect-language | co.detect_language() |\n\n## models\n\nwhen you call cohere's apis we decide on a good default model for your use-case behind the scenes. the default model is great to get you started, but in production environments we recommend that you specify the model size yourself via the `model` parameter. learn more about the available models here(https://dashboard.cohere.com)\n\n## responses\n\nall of the endpoint functions will return a cohere object corresponding to the endpoint (e.g. for generation, it would be `generation`). the responses can be found as instance variables of the object (e.g. generation would be `generation.text`). the names of these instance variables and a detailed breakdown of the response body can be found in the [sdk docs](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/about) and [cohere docs](https://docs.cohere.com/). printing the cohere response object itself will display an organized view of the instance variables.\n\n## exceptions\n\nunsuccessful api calls from the sdk will raise an exception. please see the documentation's page on [errors](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/errors) for more information about what the errors mean.\n\n## contributing\n\nto set up a development environment, first ensure you have [poetry 1.7+ installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and run:\n\n```bash\npoetry shell    # any time you want to run code or tests\npoetry install  # install and update dependencies in your environment, the first time\n```\n\nin addition, to ensure your code is formatted correctly, install pre-commit hooks using:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\nyou can run tests locally using:\n```bash\npython -m pytest\n```\n\nyou can configure a different base url with:\n```bash\nco_api_url=\"https://localhost:8050\" python3 foo.py\n```\nor in code using one of:\n```python\ncohere.cohere_api_url = \"https://localhost:8050\"    # place before client initilization\ncohere.client(...,api_url=\"https://localhost:8050\") # alternatively, as a parameter to the client\n```\n\n",
