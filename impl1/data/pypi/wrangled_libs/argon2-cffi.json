  "description": "# *argon2-cffi*: argon2 for python\n\n\n[argon2](https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2) won the [password hashing competition](https://www.password-hashing.net/) and *argon2-cffi* is the simplest way to use it in python:\n\n```pycon\n>>> from argon2 import passwordhasher\n>>> ph = passwordhasher()\n>>> hash = ph.hash(\"correct horse battery staple\")\n>>> hash  # doctest: +skip\n'$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$miirqgvgqbgj220jfp0mpa$yfwjsvjtjsu0zzv/p3s9nnq/usre2wvjmjfcijrtqbg'\n>>> ph.verify(hash, \"correct horse battery staple\")\ntrue\n>>> ph.check_needs_rehash(hash)\nfalse\n>>> ph.verify(hash, \"tr0ub4dor&3\")\ntraceback (most recent call last):\n  ...\nargon2.exceptions.verifymismatcherror: the password does not match the supplied hash\n\n```\n<!-- end short -->\n\n## project links\n\n- [**pypi**](https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi/)\n- [**github**](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi)\n- [**documentation**](https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/)\n- [**changelog**](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/blob/main/changelog.md)\n- [**funding**](https://hynek.me/say-thanks/)\n- the low-level argon2 cffi bindings are maintained in the separate [*argon2-cffi-bindings*](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi-bindings) project.\n\n## release information\n\n### removed\n\n- python 3.6 is not supported anymore.\n\n\n### deprecated\n\n- the `invalidhash` exception is deprecated in favor of `invalidhasherror`.\n  no plans for removal currently exist and the names can (but shouldn't) be used interchangeably.\n\n- `argon2.hash_password()`, `argon2.hash_password_raw()`, and `argon2.verify_password()` that have been soft-deprecated since 2016 are now hard-deprecated.\n  they now raise `deprecationwarning`s and will be removed in 2024.\n\n\n### added\n\n- official support for python 3.11 and 3.12.\n  no code changes were necessary.\n\n- `argon2.exceptions.invalidhasherror` as a replacement for `invalidhash`.\n\n- *salt* parameter to `argon2.passwordhasher.hash()` to allow for custom salts.\n  this is only useful for specialized use-cases -- leave it on none unless you know exactly what you are doing.\n  [#153](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/153)\n\n\n---\n\n[\u2192 full changelog](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/blob/main/changelog.md)\n\n\n## credits\n\n*argon2-cffi* is maintained by [hynek schlawack](https://hynek.me/).\n\nthe development is kindly supported by my employer [variomedia ag](https://www.variomedia.de/), *argon2-cffi* [tidelift subscribers](https://tidelift.com/?utm_source=lifter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hynek), and my amazing [github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).\n\n\n## *argon2-cffi* for enterprise\n\navailable as part of the tidelift subscription.\n\nthe maintainers of *argon2-cffi* and thousands of other packages are working with tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open-source packages you use to build your applications.\nsave time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact packages you use.\n[learn more.](https://tidelift.com/?utm_source=lifter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hynek)\n",
