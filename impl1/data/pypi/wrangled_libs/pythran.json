  "description": "\npythran is an ahead of time compiler for a subset of the python language, with a\nfocus on scientific computing. it takes a python module annotated with a few\ninterface descriptions and turns it into a native python module with the same\ninterface, but (hopefully) faster.\n\nit is meant to efficiently compile **scientific programs**, and takes advantage\nof multi-cores and simd instruction units.\n\nuntil 0.9.5 (included), pythran was supporting python 3 and python 2.7.\nit now only supports python **3**.\n\n",
