  "description": "mypy -- optional static typing for python\n=========================================\n\nadd type annotations to your python programs, and use mypy to type\ncheck them.  mypy is essentially a python linter on steroids, and it\ncan catch many programming errors by analyzing your program, without\nactually having to run it.  mypy has a powerful type system with\nfeatures such as type inference, gradual typing, generics and union\ntypes.\n",
