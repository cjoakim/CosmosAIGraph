  "description": "pygresql - python interface for postgresql\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\npygresql is a python module that interfaces to a postgresql database.\r\nit wraps the lower level c api library libpq to allow easy use of the\r\npowerful postgresql features from python.\r\n\r\npygresql should run on most platforms where postgresql and python is running.\r\nit is based on the pygres95 code written by pascal andre.\r\nd'arcy j. m. cain renamed it to pygresql starting with version 2.0\r\nand serves as the \"bdfl\" of pygresql.\r\nchristoph zwerschke volunteered as another maintainer and has been the main \r\ncontributor since version 3.7 of pygresql.\r\n\r\nthe following python versions are supported:\r\n\r\n* pygresql 4.x and earlier: python 2 only\r\n* pygresql 5.x: python 2 and python 3\r\n* pygresql 6.x and newer: python 3 only\r\n\r\nthe current version of pygresql supports python versions 3.7 to 3.12\r\nand postgresql versions 10 to 16 on the server.\r\n\r\ninstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nthe simplest way to install pygresql is to type::\r\n\r\n    $ pip install pygresql\r\n\r\nfor other ways of installing pygresql and requirements,\r\nsee the documentation.\r\n\r\nnote that pygresql also requires the libpq shared library to be\r\ninstalled and accessible on the client machine.\r\n\r\ndocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nthe documentation is available at\r\n`pygresql.github.io/ <http://pygresql.github.io/>`_ and at\r\n`pygresql.readthedocs.io <https://pygresql.readthedocs.io/>`_,\r\nwhere you can also find the documentation for older versions.\r\n",
