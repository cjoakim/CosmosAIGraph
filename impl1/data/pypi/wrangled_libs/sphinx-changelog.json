  "description": "a changelog renderer for sphinx.\n--------------------------------\n\nthis package provides a sphinx extension designed to facilitate rendering changelogs into your sphinx documentation.\n\ncurrently this supports `towncrier <https://github.com/twisted/towncrier>`__ and inclusion of a rest changelog file.\n\nfor more details see the documentation: https://sphinx-changelog.readthedocs.io\n\ndoing a release\n---------------\n\nfor maintainers releasing this package, follow these steps:\n\n1. update changelog.rst\n2. push a tag\n3. profit\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nthis project is copyright (c) sunpy and openastronomy developers and licensed under\nthe terms of the bsd 3-clause license. this package is based upon\nthe `openastronomy packaging guide <https://github.com/openastronomy/packaging-guide>`_\nwhich is licensed under the bsd 3-clause licence. see the licenses folder for\nmore information.\n\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\nwe love contributions! sphinx-changelog is open source,\nbuilt on open source, and we'd love to have you hang out in our community.\n\n**imposter syndrome disclaimer**: we want your help. no, really.\n\nthere may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not\nready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good\nenough to contribute. what could you possibly offer a project like this one?\n\nwe assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. if you can write code at\nall, you can contribute code to open source. contributing to open source\nprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. writing perfect code\nisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's\ntrying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those\nmistakes. that's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.\n\nbeing an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. you can\nhelp out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the\nproject (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution\nprocess). some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as\na whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see\nthe errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.\n\nnote: this disclaimer was originally written by\n`adrienne lowe <https://github.com/adriennefriend>`_ for a\n`pycon talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uj746j9heo>`_, and was adapted by\nsphinx-changelog based on its use in the readme file for the\n`metpy project <https://github.com/unidata/metpy>`_.\n",
