  "description": "confuse: painless yaml config files\n===================================\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/beetbox/confuse/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://github.com/beetbox/confuse/actions\n\n.. image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/confuse.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/confuse\n\n**confuse** is a configuration library for python that uses `yaml`_. it takes\ncare of defaults, overrides, type checking, command-line integration,\nenvironment variable support, human-readable errors, and standard os-specific\nlocations.\n\nwhat it does\n------------\n\nhere\u2019s what confuse brings to the table:\n\n-  an **utterly sensible api** resembling dictionary-and-list structures\n   but providing **transparent validation** without lots of boilerplate\n   code. type ``config['num_goats'].get(int)`` to get the configured\n   number of goats and ensure that it\u2019s an integer.\n\n-  combine configuration data from **multiple sources**. using\n   *layering*, confuse allows user-specific configuration to seamlessly\n   override system-wide configuration, which in turn overrides built-in\n   defaults. an in-package ``config_default.yaml`` can be used to\n   provide bottom-layer defaults using the same syntax that users will\n   see. a runtime overlay allows the program to programmatically\n   override and add configuration values.\n\n-  look for configuration files in **platform-specific paths**. like\n   ``$xdg_config_home`` or ``~/.config`` on unix; \"application support\" on\n   macos; ``%appdata%`` on windows. your program gets its own\n   directory, which you can use to store additional data. you can\n   transparently create this directory on demand if, for example, you\n   need to initialize the configuration file on first run. and an\n   environment variable can be used to override the directory's\n   location.\n\n-  integration with **command-line arguments** via `argparse`_ or `optparse`_\n   from the standard library. use argparse's declarative api to allow\n   command-line options to override configured defaults.\n\n-  include configuration values from **environment variables**. values undergo\n   automatic type conversion, and nested dicts and lists are supported.\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nconfuse is available on `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/confuse/>`_ and can be installed\nusing :code:`pip`:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    pip install confuse\n\nusing confuse\n-------------\n\n`confuse's documentation`_ describes its api in detail.\n\ncredits\n-------\n\nconfuse was made to power `beets`_.\nlike beets, it is available under the `mit license`_.\n\n.. _configparser: http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html\n.. _yaml: http://yaml.org/\n.. _optparse: http://docs.python.org/dev/library/optparse.html\n.. _argparse: http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html\n.. _logging: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html\n.. _confuse's documentation: http://confuse.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html\n.. _mit license: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\n.. _beets: https://github.com/beetbox/beets\n",
