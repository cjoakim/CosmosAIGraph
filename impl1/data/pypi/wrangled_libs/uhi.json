[see what's\nnew](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uhi/releases).\n\nto assist plotting libraries in accepting histograms from classic sources, see\n`uhi.numpy_plottable.ensure_plottable_histogram`, which will adapt numpy style\ntuples into a simple plottablehistogram.\n\nthe protocols provided do support runtime checking, so\n`isinstance(h, uhi.typing.plotting.plottablehistogram)` is valid at runtime and\nmight be simpler than manually checking for the expected methods.\n\n[actions-badge]:            https://github.com/scikit-hep/uhi/workflows/ci/badge.svg\n[actions-link]:             https://github.com/scikit-hep/uhi/actions\n[black-badge]:              https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg\n[black-link]:               https://github.com/psf/black\n[conda-badge]:              https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/uhi\n[conda-link]:               https://github.com/conda-forge/uhi-feedstock\n[github-discussions-badge]: https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=discussions&message=ask&color=blue&logo=github\n[github-discussions-link]:  https://github.com/scikit-hep/uhi/discussions\n[gitter-badge]:             https://badges.gitter.im/https://github.com/scikit-hep/uhi/community.svg\n[gitter-link]:              https://gitter.im/https://github.com/scikit-hep/uhi/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge\n[pre-commit-badge]:         https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/scikit-hep/uhi/main.svg\n[pre-commit-link]:          https://results.pre-commit.ci/repo/github/309772485\n[pypi-link]:                https://pypi.org/project/uhi/\n[pypi-platforms]:           https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/uhi\n[pypi-version]:             https://badge.fury.io/py/uhi.svg\n[rtd-badge]:                https://readthedocs.org/projects/uhi/badge/?version=latest\n[rtd-link]:                 https://uhi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n[sk-badge]:                 https://scikit-hep.org/assets/images/scikit--hep-project-blue.svg\n\n[boost-histogram]:          https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram\n[hist]:                     https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist\n[mplhep]:                   https://github.com/scikit-hep/mplhep\n[uproot]:                  https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4\n[histoprint]:               https://github.com/scikit-hep/histoprint\n",
