expected to be in the user's [`path`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/path_(variable)) |\n\n## installation\n\n| branch | status | installation | documentation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| master (release) | [![build_master](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/wenv/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master \"build status: master / release\")](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/wenv/tree/master) | `pip install wenv` | [![docs_master](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wenv/badge/?version=latest&style=flat-square \"documentation status: master / release\")](https://wenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) |\n| develop | [![build_develop](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/wenv/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=develop \"build status: development branch\")](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/wenv/tree/develop) | `pip install git+https://github.com/pleiszenburg/wenv.git@develop` | [![docs_develop](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wenv/badge/?version=develop&style=flat-square \"documentation status: development branch\")](https://wenv.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) |\n\nafter installing the package with `pip`, you must initialize the *wine python environment* by running `wenv init`.\n\n## examples\n\nfire up a shell and try the following:\n\n```bash\n(env) user@comp:~> uname\nlinux\n(env) user@comp:~> python -m platform\nlinux\n(env) user@comp:~> wenv python -m platform\nwindows\n```\n\n`wenv pip` works just like one would expect. have a look at the output of `wenv help` for more commands and information. for use as a shebang, `wenv python` has an alias: one can write `#!/usr/bin/env _wenv_python` at the top of scripts.\n\n``wenv python`` can also be used as a **jupyter kernel**, side-by-side with a unix-version of python. have a look at the [wenv-kernel project](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/wenv-kernel).\n\n## security\n\njust like wine, `wenv` can run malicious windows software on unix. **never, ever, run `wenv` with root / super users privileges!** for details, check the section on [security](https://wenv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html) in the documentation.\n\n## need help?\n\nsee section on [getting help](https://wenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support.html) on `wenv`'s documentation.\n\n## bugs & issues\n\nsee section on [bugs and issues](https://wenv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/bugs.html) on `wenv`'s documentation.\n\n## miscellaneous\n\n- full project documentation\n    -
