  "description": "# jupyterlab pygments theme\n\nthis package contains a syntax coloring theme for [pygments](http://pygments.org/) making use of\nthe jupyterlab css variables.\n\nthe goal is to enable the use of jupyterlab's themes with pygments-generated html.\n\n## screencast\n\nin the following screencast, we demonstrate how pygments-highlighted code can make use of the jupyterlab theme.\n\n![pygments screencast](pygments.gif)\n\n## installation\n\n`jupyterlab_pygments` can be installed with the conda package manager\n\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab_pygments\n```\n\nor from pypi\n\n```\npip install jupyterlab_pygments\n```\n\n## dependencies\n\n- `jupyterlab_pygments` requires [pygments](http://pygments.org) version `2.4.1`.\n- the css variables used by the theme correspond to the codemirror syntex coloring\n  theme defined in the npm package [@jupyterlab/codemirror](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupyterlab/codemirror). supported versions for `@jupyterlab/codemirror`'s css include `0.19.1`, `^1.0`, and, `^2.0`.\n\n## limitations\n\npygments-generated html and css classes are not granular enough to reproduce\nall of the details of codemirror (the javascript text editor used by jupyterlab).\n\nthis includes the ability to differentiate properties from general names.\n\n## license\n\n`jupyterlab_pygments` uses a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the\ncopyright on their contributions. all code is licensed under the terms of the revised [bsd license](license).\n",
