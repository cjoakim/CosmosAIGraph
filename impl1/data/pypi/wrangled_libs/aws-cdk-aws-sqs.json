  "description": "# amazon simple queue service construct library\n\n<!--begin stability banner-->---\n\n\n![end-of-support](https://img.shields.io/badge/end--of--support-critical.svg?style=for-the-badge)\n\n> aws cdk v1 has reached end-of-support on 2023-06-01.\n> this package is no longer being updated, and users should migrate to aws cdk v2.\n>\n> for more information on how to migrate, see the [*migrating to aws cdk v2* guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/migrating-v2.html).\n\n---\n<!--end stability banner-->\n\namazon simple queue service (sqs) is a fully managed message queuing service that\nenables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless\napplications. sqs eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and\noperating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work.\nusing sqs, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume,\nwithout losing messages or requiring other services to be available.\n\n## installation\n\nimport to your project:\n\n```python\nimport aws_cdk.aws_sqs as sqs\n```\n\n## basic usage\n\nhere's how to add a basic queue to your application:\n\n```python\nsqs.queue(self, \"queue\")\n```\n\n## encryption\n\nif you want to encrypt the queue contents, set the `encryption` property. you can have\nthe messages encrypted with a key that sqs manages for you, or a key that you\ncan manage yourself.\n\n```python\n# use managed key\nsqs.queue(self, \"queue\",\n    encryption=sqs.queueencryption.kms_managed\n)\n\n# use custom key\nmy_key = kms.key(self, \"key\")\n\nsqs.queue(self, \"queue\",\n    encryption=sqs.queueencryption.kms,\n    encryption_master_key=my_key\n)\n```\n\n## first-in-first-out (fifo) queues\n\nfifo queues give guarantees on the order in which messages are dequeued, and have additional\nfeatures in order to help guarantee exactly-once processing. for more information, see\nthe sqs manual. note that fifo queues are not available in all aws regions.\n\na queue can be made a fifo queue by either setting `fifo: true`, giving it a name which ends\nin `\".fifo\"`, or by enabling a fifo specific feature such as: content-based deduplication,\ndeduplication scope or fifo throughput limit.\n",
