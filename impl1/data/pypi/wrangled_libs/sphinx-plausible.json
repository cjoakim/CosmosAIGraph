  "description": "# sphinx extension for plausible.io\n\nthis extension adds the <https://plausible.io> script to a sphinx\nproject by using standard sphinx javascript insertion tools.  it\ndoesn't change the template, and it should work with any template\n(that uses the standard sphinx javascript insertion, which seems to be\nmost of them).\n\nthis is a relatively new project (but being used), so please verify it\ndoes the correct thing in your case and suggest improvements.\n\n\n\n## plausible without this extension\n\nactually, this extension isn't needed, you can directly add a script\nwith the required tags by doing the following.  this uses the same\ninsertion mechanism as this extension, and thus should work with any\nwell-designed theme with no modifications:\n\n```python\nhtml_js_files = [\n    ('https://plausible.io/js/script.js', {\"data-domain\": \"yourdomain.com\", \"defer\": \"defer\"}),\n]\n```\n\n\n\n## installation\n\ninstall the python package: on pypi it is `sphinx-plausible`:\n\n```\npip install sphinx-plausible\n```\n\n\n\n## usage\n\nadd `sphinx_plausible` to `extensions`.  example config:\n\n```python\nextensions = [\n    \"sphinx_plausible\",\n]\n\nplausible_domain = \"my.domain.org\"\n```\n\nif you want plausible to only be enabled when your site is deployed by\ngithub actions on the `main` branch in your own repository (remember\nto update `organization/repo-name`):\n\n```python\nimport os\nplausible_enabled = (\n    'github_action' in os.environ\n    and os.environ.get('github_repository', '').lower() == 'organization-name/repo-name'\n    and os.environ.get('github_ref') == 'refs/heads/main'\n    )\n```\n\nconfiguration options:\n\n* `plausible_domain` (required): the domain name, like\n  `my.domain.org`.  can be a list which will be joined by commas.\n\n* `plausible_script` (default `https://plausible.io/js/script.js`):\n  the url to the script to load.  if you want to use embed the script,\n  download the script and put it in `html_static_path` and add the\n  filename (relative to `html_static_path`) here instead of a url.\n\n* `plausible_enabled` (default `true`): should plausible be active?\n  you might want to disable it on all you test deployments and so on,\n  so you can add some logic to enable/disable as needed.\n\n\n\n## status and development\n\nbeta but works as of 2022 - improvements and feature requests are\nstill welcome!  i would be happy for a group maintenance home for\nthis.\n\n\n\n## see also\n\n* https://plausible.io/docs/plausible-script\n",
