  "description": "==============\npython libnacl\n==============\n\nthis library is used to gain direct access to the functions exposed by\ndaniel j. bernstein's nacl library via libsodium. it has\nbeen constructed to maintain extensive documentation on how to use nacl\nas well as being completely portable. the file in libnacl/__init__.py\ncan be pulled out and placed directly in any project to give a single file\nbinding to all of nacl.\n\nhigher level classes\n====================\n\nthe libnacl code also ships with many high level classes which make nacl\ncryptography easy and safe, for documentation please see:\nhttp://libnacl.readthedocs.org/\n\nwhy libnacl\n===========\n\nthere are a number of libraries out there binding to libsodium, so why make\nlibnacl?\n\n1. libnacl does not have any non-python hard deps outside of libsodium\n2. libnacl does not need to be compiled\n3. libnacl is easy to package and very portable\n4. inclusion of high level pythonic encryption classes\n5. ability to have a single embeddable and transferable bindings file\n   that can be added directly to python applications without needing\n   to dep libnacl\n\nthis makes libnacl very portable, very easy to use and easy to distribute.\n\ninstall\n=======\n\nthe libnacl code is easiy installed via a setup.py from the source or via pip.\n\nfrom source:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    tar xvf libnacl-1.5.2.tar.gz\n    cd libnacl-1.5.2\n    python setup.py install\n\nvia pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install libnacl\n\nremember that libnacl can be installed for python 2 and 3.\n\nlinux distributions\n-------------------\n\nlibnacl is shiped with many linux distributions, check your distribution\npackage manager for the package ``python-libnacl``, ``python2-libnacl``\nand/or ``python3-libnacl``.\n",
