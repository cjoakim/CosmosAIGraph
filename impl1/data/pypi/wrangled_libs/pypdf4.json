  "description": "a pure-python library built as a pdf toolkit.  it is capable of:\n\n- extracting document information (title, author, ...)\n- splitting documents page by page\n- merging documents page by page\n- cropping pages\n- merging multiple pages into a single page\n- encrypting and decrypting pdf files\n- and more!\n\nby being pure-python, it should run on any python platform without any\ndependencies on external libraries.  it can also work entirely on stringio\nobjects rather than file streams, allowing for pdf manipulation in memory.\nit is therefore a useful tool for websites that manage or manipulate pdfs.",
