some additional steps before running the code under test\n    result = user('usera')\n    # some additional steps before verifying all interactions have occurred\n    pact.verify()\n```\n\n### requests\n\nwhen defining the expected http request that your code is expected to make you\ncan specify the method, path, body, headers, and query:\n\n```python\npact.with_request(\n    method='get',\n    path='/api/v1/my-resources/',\n    query={'search': 'example'}\n)\n```\n\n`query` is used to specify url query parameters, so the above example expects\na request made to `/api/v1/my-resources/?search=example`.\n\n```python\npact.with_request(\n    method='post',\n    path='/api/v1/my-resources/123',\n    body={'user_ids': [1, 2, 3]},\n    headers={'content-type': 'application/json'},\n)\n```\n\nyou can define exact values for your expected request like the examples above,\nor you can use the matchers defined later to assist in handling values that are\nvariable.\n\nthe default hostname and port for the pact mock service will be\n`localhost:1234` but you can adjust this during pact creation:\n\n```python\nfrom pact import consumer, provider\npact = consumer('consumer').has_pact_with(\n    provider('provider'), host_name='mockservice', port=8080)\n```\n\nthis can be useful if you need to run to create more than one pact for your test\nbecause your code interacts with two different services. it is important to note\nthat the code you are testing with this contract _must_ contact the mock service.\nso in this example, the `user` method could accept an argument to specify the\nlocation of the server, or retrieve it from an environment variable so you can\nchange its uri during the test.\n\nthe mock service offers you several important features when building your contracts:\n- it provides a real http server that your code can contact during the test and provides the responses you defined.\n- you provide it with the expectations for the request your code will make and it will assert the contents of the actual requests made based on your expectations.\n- if a request is made that does not match one you defined or if a request from your code is missing it will return an error with details.\n- finally, it will record your contracts as a json file that you can store in your repository or publish to a pact broker.\n\n## expecting variable content\nthe above test works great if that user information is always static, but what happens if\nthe user has a last updated field that is set to the current time every time the object is\nmodified? to handle variable data and make your tests more robust, there are 3 helpful matchers:\n\n### term(matcher, generate)\nasserts the value should match the given regular expression. you could use this\nto expect a timestamp with a particular format in the request or response where\nyou know you need a particular format, but are unconcerned about the exact date:\n\n```python\nfrom pact import term\n...\nbody = {\n    'username': 'usera',\n    'last_modified': term('\\d+-\\d+-\\d+t\\d+:\\d+:\\d+', '2016-12-15t20:16:01')\n}\n\n(pact\n .given('usera exists and is not an administrator')\n .upon_receiving('a request for usera')\n .with_request('get', '/users/usera/info')\n .will_respond_with(200, body=body))\n```\n\nwhen you run the tests for the consumer, the mock service will return the value you provided\nas `generate`, in this case `2016-12-15t20:16:01`. when the contract is verified on the\nprovider, the regex will be used to search the response from the real provider service\nand the test will be considered successful if the regex finds a match in the response.\n\n### like(matcher)\nasserts the element's type matches the matcher. for example:\n\n```python\nfrom pact import like\nlike(123)  # matches if the value is an integer\nlike('hello world')  # matches if the value is a string\nlike(3.14)  # matches if the value is a float\n```\nthe argument supplied to `like` will be what the mock service responds with.\n\nwhen a dictionary is used as an argument for like, all the child objects (and their child objects etc.) will be matched according to their types, unless you use a more specific matcher like a term.\n\n```python\nfrom pact import like, term\nlike({\n    'username': term('[a-za-z]+', 'username'),\n    'id': 123, # integer\n    'confirmed': false, # boolean\n    'address': { # dictionary\n        'street': '200 bourke st' # string\n    }\n})\n\n```\n\n### eachlike(matcher, minimum=1)\nasserts the value is an array type that consists of elements\nlike the one passed in. it can be used to assert simple arrays:\n\n```python\nfrom pact import eachlike\neachlike(1)  # all items are integers\neachlike('hello')  # all items are strings\n```\n\nor other matchers can be nested inside to assert more complex objects:\n\n```python\nfrom pact import eachlike, term\neachlike({\n    'username': term('[a-za-z]+', 'username'),\n    'id': 123,\n    'groups': eachlike('administrators')\n})\n```\n\n> note, you do not need to specify everything that will be returned from the provider in a\n> json response, any extra data that is received will be ignored and the tests will still pass.\n\n> note, to get the generated values from an object that can contain matchers like term, like, eachlike, etc.\n> for assertion in self.assertequal(result, expected) you may need to use get_generated_values() helper function:\n\n```python\nfrom pact.matchers import get_generated_values\nself.assertequal(result, get_generated_values(expected))\n```\n\n### match common formats\noften times, you find yourself having to re-write regular expressions for common formats.\n\n```python\nfrom pact import format\nformat().integer  # matches if the value is an integer\nformat().ip_address  # matches if the value is an ip address\n```\n\nwe've created a number of them for you to save you the time:\n\n| matcher           | description                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `identifier`      | match an id (e.g. 42)                                                                                                   |\n| `integer`         | match all numbers that are integers (both ints and longs)                                                               |\n| `decimal`         | match all real numbers (floating point and decimal)                                                                     |\n| `hexadecimal`     | match all hexadecimal encoded strings                                                                                   |\n| `date`            | match string containing basic iso8601 dates (e.g. 2016-01-01)                                                           |\n| `timestamp`       | match a string containing an rfc3339 formatted timestamp (e.g. mon, 31 oct 2016 15:21:41 -0400)                         |\n| `time`            | match string containing times in iso date format (e.g. t22:44:30.652z)                                                  |\n| `iso_datetime`    | match string containing iso 8601 formatted dates (e.g. 2015-08-06t16:53:10+01:00)                                       |\n| `iso_datetime_ms` | match string containing iso 8601 formatted dates, enforcing millisecond precision (e.g. 2015-08-06t16:53:10.123+01:00)  |\n| `ip_address`      | match string containing ip4 formatted address                                                                           |\n| `ipv6_address`    | match string containing ip6 formatted address                                                                           |\n| `uuid`            | match strings containing uuids                                                                                          |\n\nthese can be used to replace other matchers\n\n```python\nfrom pact import like, format\nlike({\n    'id': format().integer, #

[pact cli tools](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/client_cli) **recommended**\n2. pact python api\n\n### cli\n\nsee [publishing and retrieving pacts](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/publishing_and_retrieving_pacts)\n\nexample uploading to a pact broker\n\n```\npact-broker publish /path/to/pacts/consumer-provider.json --consumer-app-version 1.0.0 --branch main --broker-base-url https://test.pactflow.io --broker-username someusername --broker-password somepassword\n```\n\nexample uploading to a pactflow broker\n\n```\npact-broker publish /path/to/pacts/consumer-provider.json --consumer-app-version 1.0.0 --branch main --broker-base-url https://test.pactflow.io --broker-token sometoken\n```\n\n### python api\n\n```python\nbroker = broker(broker_base_url=\"http://localhost\")\nbroker.publish(\"testconsumer\",\n                       \"2.0.1\",\n                       branch='consumer-branch',\n                       pact_dir='.')\n\noutput, logs = verifier.verify_pacts('./userserviceclient-userservice.json')\n\n```\n\nthe parameters for this differ slightly in naming from their cli equivalents:\n| cli                               |      native python                |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| `--branch`                        | `branch`

addition to writing pacts for python consumers, you can also verify those pacts\nagainst a provider of any language. there are two ways to do this.\n\n### cli\n\nafter installing pact-python a `pact-verifier`\napplication should be available. to get details about its use you can call it with the\nhelp argument:\n\n```bash\npact-verifier --help\n```\n\nthe simplest example is verifying a server with locally stored pact files and no provider\nstates:\n\n```bash\npact-verifier --provider-base-url=http://localhost:8080 --pact-url=./pacts/consumer-provider.json\n```\n\nwhich will immediately invoke the pact verifier, making http requests to the server located\nat `http://localhost:8080` based on the pacts in `./pacts/consumer-provider.json` and\nreporting the results.\n\nthere are several options for configuring how the pacts are verified:\n\n###### --provider-base-url\n\nrequired. defines the url of the server to make requests to when verifying the pacts.\n\n###### --pact-url\n\nrequired if --pact-urls not specified. the location of a pact file you want\nto verify. this can be a url to a [pact broker] or a local path, to provide\nmultiple files, specify multiple arguments.\n\n```\npact-verifier --provider-base-url=http://localhost:8080 --pact-url=./pacts/one.json --pact-url=./pacts/two.json\n```\n\n###### --pact-urls\n\nrequired if --pact-url not specified. the location of the pact files you want\nto verify. this can be a url to a [pact broker] or one or more local paths, separated by a comma.\n\n###### --provider-states-url\n\n_deprecated after v 0.6.0._ the url where your provider application will produce the list of available provider states.\nthe verifier calls this url to ensure the pacts specify valid states before making the http\nrequests.\n\n###### --provider-states-setup-url\n\nthe url which should be called to setup a specific provider state before a pact is verified. this url will be called with a post request, and the json body `{consumer: 'consumer name', state: 'a thing exists'}`.\n\n###### --pact-broker-url\n\nbase url for the pact broker instance to publish pacts to. can also be specified via the environment variable\n`pact_broker_base_url`.\n\n###### --pact-broker-username\n\nthe username to use when contacting the pact broker. can also be specified via the environment variable\n`pact_broker_username`.\n\n###### --pact-broker-password\n\nthe password to use when contacting the pact broker. you can also specify this value\nas the environment variable `pact_broker_password`.\n\n###### --pact-broker-token\n\nthe bearer token to use when contacting the pact broker. you can also specify this value\nas the environment variable `pact_broker_token`.\n\n###### --consumer-version-tag\n\nretrieve the latest pacts with this consumer version tag. used in conjunction with `--provider`.\nmay be specified multiple times.\n\n###### --consumer-version-selector\n\nyou can also retrieve pacts with consumer version selector, a more flexible approach in specifying which pacts you need.\nmay be specified multiple times. read more about selectors [here](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/advanced_topics/consumer_version_selectors/).\n\n###### --provider-version-tag\n\ntag to apply to the provider application version. may be specified multiple times.\n\n###### --provider-version-branch\n\nbranch to apply to the provider application version.\n\n###### --custom-provider-header\n\nheader to add to provider state set up and pact verification requests e.g.`authorization: basic cgfjddpwywn0`\nmay be specified multiple times.\n\n###### -t, --timeout\n\nthe duration in seconds we should wait to confirm that the verification process was successful. defaults to 30.\n\n###### -a, --provider-app-version\n\nthe provider application version. required for publishing verification results.\n\n###### -r, --publish-verification-results\n\npublish verification results to the broker.\n\n### python api\nyou can use the verifier class. this allows you to write native python code and the test framework of your choice.\n\n```python\nverifier = verifier(provider='userservice',\n                    provider_base_url=pact_url)\n\n# using a local pact file\n\nsuccess, logs = verifier.verify_pacts('./userserviceclient-userservice.json')\nassert success == 0\n\n# using a pact broker\n\n- for oss pact broker, use broker_username / broker_password\n- for pactflow pact broker, use broker_token\n\nsuccess, logs = verifier.verify_with_broker(\n    # broker_username=pact_broker_username,\n    # broker_password=pact_broker_password,\n    broker_url=pact_broker_url,\n    broker_token=pact_broker_token,\n    publish_version=application_version,\n    publish_verification_results=true,\n    verbose=true,\n    provider_version_branch=provider_branch,\n    enable_pending=true,\n)\nassert success == 0\n\n```\n\nthe parameters for this differ slightly in naming from their cli equivalents:\n| cli                               |  native python

test](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/tree/master/examples/fastapi_provider/tests/provider/test_provider.py)\n\n### provider states\nin many cases, your contracts will need very specific data to exist on the provider\nto pass successfully. if you are fetching a user profile, that user needs to exist,\nif querying a list of records, one or more records needs to exist. to support\ndecoupling the testing of the consumer and provider, pact offers the idea of provider\nstates to communicate from the consumer what data should exist on the provider.\n\nwhen setting up the testing of a provider you will also need to setup the management of\nthese provider states. the pact verifier does this by making additional http requests to\nthe `--provider-states-setup-url` you provide. this url could be\non the provider application or a separate one. some strategies for managing state include:\n\n- having endpoints in your application that are not active in production that create and delete your datastore state\n- a separate application that has access to the same datastore to create and delete, like a separate app engine module or docker container pointing to the same datastore\n- a standalone application that can start and stop the other server with different datastore states\n\nfor more information about provider states, refer to the [pact documentation] on [provider states].\n\n# development\n<!-- absolute link for rendering page in docs.pact.io -->\nplease read [contributing.md](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/blob/master/contributing.md)\n\nto setup a development environment:\n\n1. if you want to run tests for all python versions, install 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 from source or using a tool like [pyenv]\n2. its recommended to create a python [virtualenv] for the project\n\nto setup the environment, run tests, and package the application, run:\n`make release`\n\nif you are just interested in packaging pact-python so you can install it using pip:\n\n`make package`\n\nthis creates a `dist/pact-python-n.n.n.tar.gz` file, where the ns are the current version.\nfrom there you can use pip to install it:\n\n`pip install ./dist/pact-python-n.n.n.tar.gz`\n\n## offline installation of standalone packages\n\nalthough all ruby standalone applications are predownloaded into the wheel artifact, it may be useful, for development, purposes to install custom ruby binaries. in which case, use the `bin-path` flag.\n```\npip
