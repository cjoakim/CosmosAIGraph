do stuff...\n\n        pass\n\nthis will immediately recurse through the directory tree and add watches on all subdirectories. new directories will automatically have watches added for them and deleted directories will be cleaned-up.\n\nthe other differences from the standard functionality:\n\n- you can't remove a watch since watches are automatically managed.\n- even if you provide a very restrictive mask that doesn't allow for directory create/delete events, the *in_isdir*, *in_create*, and *in_delete* flags will still be seen.\n\n\n=====\nnotes\n=====\n\n- **important:** recursively monitoring paths is **not** a functionality provided by the kernel. rather, we artificially implement it. as directory-created events are received, we create watches for the child directories on-the-fly. this means that there is potential for a race condition: if a directory is created and a file or directory is created inside before you (using the `event_gen()` loop) have a chance to observe it, then you are going to have a problem: if it is a file, then you will miss the events related to its creation, but, if it is a directory, then not only will you miss those creation events but this library will also miss them and not be able to add a watch for them. if you are dealing with a **large number of hierarchical directory creations** and have the ability to be aware new directories via a secondary channel with some lead time before any files are populated *into* them, you can take advantage of this and call `add_watch()` manually. in this case there is limited value in using `inotifytree()`/`inotifytree()` instead of just `inotify()` but this choice is left to you.\n\n- *epoll* is used to audit for *inotify* kernel events.\n\n- **the earlier versions of this project had only partial python 3 compatibility (string related). this required doing the string<->bytes conversions outside of this project. as of the current version, this has been fixed. however, this means that python 3 users may experience breakages until this is compensated-for on their end. it will obviously be trivial for this project to detect the type of the arguments that are passed but there'd be no concrete way of knowing which type to return. better to just fix it completely now and move forward.**\n\n- you may also choose to pass the list of directories to watch via the *paths* parameter of the constructor. this would work best in situations where your list of paths is static.\n\n- calling `remove_watch()` is not strictly necessary. the *inotify* resources is automatically cleaned-up, which would clean-up all watch resources as well.\n\n\n=======\ntesting\n=======\n\ncall \"test.sh\" to run the tests::\n\n    $ ./test.sh\n    test__cycle (tests.test_inotify.testinotify) ... ok\n    test__get_event_names (tests.test_inotify.testinotify) ... ok\n    test__international_naming_python2 (tests.test_inotify.testinotify) ... skip: not in python 2\n    test__international_naming_python3 (tests.test_inotify.testinotify) ... ok\n    test__automatic_new_watches_on_existing_paths (tests.test_inotify.testinotifytree) ... ok\n    test__automatic_new_watches_on_new_paths (tests.test_inotify.testinotifytree) ... ok\n    test__cycle (tests.test_inotify.testinotifytree) ... ok\n    test__renames (tests.test_inotify.testinotifytree) ... ok\n    test__cycle (tests.test_inotify.testinotifytrees) ... ok\n\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    ran 9 tests in 12.039s\n\n    ok (skip=1)\n\n.. |build_status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/dsoprea/pyinotify.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/dsoprea/pyinotify\n.. |coverage_status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dsoprea/pyinotify/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/dsoprea/pyinotify?branch=master\n\n\n",
