  "description": "selenium2library\n================\n\nselenium2library is a web testing library for `robot framework`_\nthat uses the selenium_ tool internally. the project is hosted on\ngithub_ and downloads can be found from pypi_.\n\nstarting from version 3.0, selenium2library is renamed to seleniumlibrary_\nand this project exists mainly to help with transitioning.\n\nversions\n--------\n\nselenium2library 3.0 and newer extend the new seleniumlibrary_ and thus\ncontain exactly the same code and functionality. there have been lot of\ninternal changes in the library, but external functionality provided by\nkeywords should be fully backwards compatible. libraries and tools using\nselenium2library internally may need to be updated to support\nselenium2library 3.0, though. selenium2library 1.8 is the latest, and last,\nlegacy version with the old architecture and code.\n\nselenium2library 3.0 supports python 2.7 as well as python 3.3 and newer.\nselenium2library 1.8 supports python 2.6-2.7.\n\nkeyword documentation\n---------------------\n\n- `selenium2library 3.0`__ (latest)\n- `selenium2library 1.8`__ (legacy)\n\n__ http://robotframework.org/selenium2library/selenium2library.html\n__ http://robotframework.org/selenium2library/selenium2library-1.8.0.html\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nthe recommended approach to install selenium2library, regardless the version,\nis using pip_.\n\ninstall (or upgrade) the latest selenium2library version::\n\n    pip install --upgrade robotframework-selenium2library\n\ninstall the legacy selenium2library 1.8.0 version::\n\n    pip install robotframework-selenium2library==1.8.0\n\nmigrating to seleniumlibrary\n----------------------------\n\nexisting selenium2library users should start migrating to the\nseleniumlibrary_. for most users this should be a simple procedure:\n\n1. install the latest selenium2library as explained above. this installs\n   both seleniumlibrary and selenium2library, and in fact selenium2library\n   is nowadays just a thin wrapper for seleniumlibrary.\n\n2. execute tests normally to see are there problems.\n\n3. if problems are encountered, try on investigate why they occur. possible\n   problems can be divided into two categories:\n\n   - if a keyword provided by the library itself has changed, take a look at\n     `seleniumlibrary 3.0 release notes`_ to see is it a known backwards\n     incompatible change. if it isn't, you may have encountered a regression\n     that ought to be reported to `seleniumlibrary issue tracker`_.\n\n   - if a library using selenium2library does not work anymore, it is likely\n     due to the large internal changes in seleniumlibrary 3.0. report the\n     problem to the maintainers of the broken library or fix the problem\n     yourself if you are the maintainer.\n\n   regardless the problem, you can always ask help on various `support\n   channels`_.\n\n4. if no problems occur or after problems have been resolved, you can start\n   changing library imports to use ``seleniumlibrary`` instead of\n   ``selenium2library``. also all keyword usages in form like\n   ``selenium2library.title should be`` need to be updated.\n\n5. after test data has been updated, selenium2library installation can\n   be removed altogether.\n\n.. _robot framework: http://robotframework.org\n.. _selenium: http://seleniumhq.org\n.. _pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-selenium2library\n.. _github: https://github.com/robotframework/selenium2library\n.. _seleniumlibrary: https://github.com/robotframework/seleniumlibrary\n.. _pip: http://pip-installer.org\n.. _seleniumlibrary 3.0 release notes: https://github.com/robotframework/seleniumlibrary/blob/master/docs/seleniumlibrary-3.0.0.rst\n.. _seleniumlibrary issue tracker: https://github.com/robotframework/seleniumlibrary/issues\n.. _support channels: http://robotframework.org/#support\n\n\n",
