setup the http client api from user-password\n    # when choosing the api_base_url env var, choose from one of the above based on your location.\n    # asia-pacific: \"iotx-ap.meross.com\"\n    # europe: \"iotx-eu.meross.com\"\n    #

[follow instructions here](https://github.com/albertogeniola/merossiot/issues/62#issuecomment-535769621).\n\n## donate!\ni like reverse engineering and protocol inspection, i think it keeps your mind trained and healthy.\nhowever, if you liked or appreciated by work, why don't you buy me a beer?\nit would really motivate me to continue working on this repository to improve documentation, code and extend the supported meross devices.\n\nmoreover, donations will make me raise money to spend on other meross devices.\nso far, i've bought the following devices:\n- msl120\n- mss210\n- mss310\n- mss425e\n- mss530h\n- msg100\n- msh300\n- msxh0\n- msg200\n- mts200\n- mrs100\n- mod150\n\nby issuing a donation, you will:\n1. give me the opportunity to buy new devices and support them in this library\n1. pay part of electricity bill used to keep running the plugs 24/7\n(note that they are used for unit-testing on the continuous integration engine when someone pushes a pr... i love devoping!)  \n1. you'll increase the quality of my coding sessions with free-beer!\n\n[![buy me a coffee!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/black_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/albertogeniola)\n[![apply for github sponsorship](https://korlibs.soywiz.com/i/github_sponsors_big_box_small.png)](https://github.com/sponsors/albertogeniola/dashboard/tiers)\n\n\n### look at these babies!\n\n<p>\nlook at the test environment that ensures high quality code of the library!\n</p>\n<img src=\"ext-res/plugs/test-env.jpg\" alt=\"current test environemnt\" width=\"400\" />\n<p>when a pull-request is performed against this repository, a ci pipeline takes care of building the code,\ntesting it on python 3.5/3.6/3.7, relying on some junit tests and, if all the tests pass as expected, the library\nis released on pypi. however, to ensure that the code <i>really works</i>,\nthe pipeline will issue on/off commands against real devices, that are dedicated 24/7 to the tests.\nsuch devices have been bought by myself (with contributions received by donors).\nhowever, keeping such devices connected 24/7 has a cost, which i sustain happily due to the success of the library.\nanyway, feel free to contribute via donations!\n</p>\n\n## changelog\n#### 0.4.6.0\n- note: this api version breaks backward compatibility with login method. when upgrading to this version, \nmake sure to pass the new api_base_url value
