  "description": "a python module to customize the process title\n==============================================\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle/workflows/tests/badge.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle/actions?query=workflow%3atests\n    :alt: tests\n\n:author: daniele varrazzo\n\nthe ``setproctitle`` module allows a process to change its title (as displayed\nby system tools such as ``ps``, ``top`` or macos activity monitor).\n\nchanging the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for example\nwhen a master process is forked: changing the children's title allows to\nidentify the task each process is busy with.  the technique is used by\npostgresql_ and the `openssh server`_ for example.\n\nthe procedure is hardly portable across different systems.  postgresql provides\na good `multi-platform implementation`__:  this package was born as a wrapper\naround postgresql code.\n\n- `homepage

_postgresql: http://www.postgresql.org\n.. _openssh server: http://www.openssh.com/\n.. __: http://doxygen.postgresql.org/ps__status_8c_source.html\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\n``setproctitle`` is a c extension: in order to build it you will need a c\ncompiler and the python development support (the ``python-dev`` or\n``python3-dev`` package in most linux distributions). no further external\ndependencies are required.\n\nyou can use ``pip`` to install the module::\n\n    pip install setproctitle\n\nyou can use ``pip -t`` or ``virtualenv`` for local installations, ``sudo pip``\nfor a system-wide one... the usual stuff. read pip_ or virtualenv_ docs for\nall the details.\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.readthedocs.org/\n.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\n.. note::\n   you should import and use the module (even just calling ``getproctitle()``)\n   pretty early in your program lifetime: code writing env vars `may\n   interfere`__ with the module initialisation.\n\n    .. __: https://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle/issues/42\n\n\nthe ``setproctitle`` module exports the following functions:\n\n``setproctitle(title)``\n    set *title* as the title for the current process.\n\n``getproctitle()``\n    return the current process title.\n\nthe process title is usually visible in files such as ``/proc/pid/cmdline``,\n``/proc/pid/status``, ``/proc/pid/comm``, depending on the operating system\nand kernel version. these information are used by user-space tools such as\n``ps`` and ``top``.\n\n\n``setthreadtitle(title)``\n    set *title* as the title for the current thread.\n\n``getthreadtitle()``\n    get the current thread title.\n\nthe thread title is exposed by some operating systems as the file\n``/proc/pid/task/tid/comm``, which is used by certain tools such as ``htop``.\n\n\nenvironment variables\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\na few environment variables can be used to customize the module behavior:\n\n``spt_noenv``\n    avoid clobbering ``/proc/pid/environ``.\n\n    on many platforms, setting the process title will clobber the\n    ``environ`` memory area. ``os.environ`` will work as expected from within\n    the python process, but the content of the file ``/proc/pid/environ`` will\n    be overwritten.  if you require this file not to be broken you can set the\n    ``spt_noenv`` environment variable to any non-empty value: in this case\n    the maximum length for the title will be limited to the length of the\n    command line.\n\n``spt_debug``\n    print debug information on ``stderr``.\n\n    if the module doesn't work as expected you can set this variable to a\n    non-empty value to generate information useful for debugging.  note that\n    the most useful information is printed when the module is imported, not\n    when the functions are called.\n\n\nmodule status\n-------------\n\nthe module can be currently compiled and effectively used on the following\nplatforms:\n\n- gnu/linux\n- bsd\n- macos x\n- windows\n\nnote that on windows there is no way to change the process string:\nwhat the module does is to create a *named object* whose value can be read\nusing a tool such as `process explorer`_ (contribution of a more useful tool\nto be used together with ``setproctitle`` would be well accepted).\n\nthe module can probably work on hp-ux, but i haven't found any to test with.\nit is unlikely that it can work on solaris instead.\n\n.. _process explorer:

thread+fork\n  (issue #113).\n\n\nversion 1.3.1\n-------------\n\n- fixed segfault on macos 12.5 in forked processes (issue #111).\n  note that, as a workaround, activity monitor will show the title of the\n  parent.\n\n\nversion 1.3.0\n-------------\n\n- added fallback no-op implementation if building the extension fails.\n- added support for displaying title as the process name in macos activity\n  monitor (issue #10).\n- fixed \"symbol not found: _py_getargcargv\" error when using xcode provided\n  python (issues #82, #103).\n- fixed freebsd support, broken in 1.2 (issue #94).\n-

variable ``spt_noenv`` is set (issue #16).\n\n\nversion 1.1.2\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- find the setproctitle include file on openbsd (issue #11).\n- skip test with unicode if the file system encoding
