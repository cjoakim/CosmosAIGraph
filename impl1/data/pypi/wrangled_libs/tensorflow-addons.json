  "description": "tensorflow addons is a repository of contributions that conform to well-\nestablished api patterns, but implement new functionality not available\nin core tensorflow. tensorflow natively supports a large number of\noperators, layers, metrics, losses, and optimizers. however, in a fast\nmoving field like ml, there are many interesting new developments that\ncannot be integrated into core tensorflow (because their broad\napplicability is not yet clear, or it is mostly used by a smaller subset\nof the community).\n\n\n",
