  "description": "# the cityscapes dataset\n\nthis repository contains scripts for inspection, preparation, and evaluation of the cityscapes dataset. this large-scale dataset contains a diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in street scenes from 50 different cities, with high quality pixel-level annotations of 5\u202f000 frames in addition to a larger set of 20\u202f000 weakly annotated frames.\n\ndetails and download are available at: www.cityscapes-dataset.com\n\n\n## dataset structure\n\nthe folder structure of the cityscapes dataset is as follows:\n```\n{root}/{type}{video}/{split}/{city}/{city}_{seq:0>6}_{frame:0>6}_{type}{ext}\n```\n\nthe meaning of the individual elements is:\n - `root`  the root folder of the cityscapes dataset. many of our scripts check if an environment variable `cityscapes_dataset` pointing to this folder exists and use this as the default choice.\n - `type`  the type/modality of data, e.g. `gtfine` for fine ground truth, or `leftimg8bit` for left 8-bit images.\n - `split` the split, i.e. train/val/test/train_extra/demovideo. note that not all kinds of data exist for all splits. thus, do not be surprised to occasionally find empty folders.\n - `city`  the city in which this part of the dataset was recorded.\n - `seq`   the sequence number using 6 digits.\n - `frame` the frame number using 6 digits. note that in some cities very few, albeit very long sequences were recorded, while in some cities many short sequences were recorded, of which only the 19th frame is annotated.\n - `ext`   the extension of the file and optionally a suffix, e.g. `_polygons.json` for ground truth files\n\npossible values of `type`\n - `gtfine`       the fine annotations, 2975 training, 500 validation, and 1525 testing. this type of annotations is used for validation, testing, and optionally for training. annotations are encoded using `json` files containing the individual polygons. additionally, we provide `png` images, where pixel values encode labels. please refer to `helpers/labels.py` and the scripts in `preparation` for details.\n - `gtcoarse`     the coarse annotations, available for all training and validation images and for another set of 19998 training images (`train_extra`). these annotations can be used for training, either together with gtfine or alone in a weakly supervised setup.\n - `gtbbox3d`     3d bounding box annotations of vehicles. please refer to [cityscapes 3d (g\u00e4hlert et al., cvprw '20)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07864) for details.\n - `gtbboxcitypersons` pedestrian bounding box annotations, available for all training and validation images. please refer to `helpers/labels_citypersons.py` as well as [citypersons (zhang et al., cvpr '17)](https://bitbucket.org/shanshanzhang/citypersons) for more details. the four values of a bounding box are (x, y, w, h), where (x, y) is its top-left corner and (w, h) its width and height.\n - `leftimg8bit`  the left images in 8-bit ldr format. these are the standard annotated images.\n - `leftimg8bit_blurred`  the left images in 8-bit ldr format with faces and license plates blurred. please compute results on the original images but use the blurred ones for visualization. we thank [mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/) for blurring the images.\n - `leftimg16bit` the left images in 16-bit hdr format. these images offer 16 bits per pixel of color depth and contain more information, especially in very dark or bright parts of the scene. warning: the images are stored as 16-bit pngs, which is non-standard and not supported by all libraries.\n - `rightimg8bit`  the right stereo views in 8-bit ldr format.\n - `rightimg16bit` the right stereo views in 16-bit hdr format.\n - `timestamp`     the time of recording in ns. the first frame of each sequence always has a timestamp of 0.\n - `disparity`     precomputed disparity depth maps. to obtain the disparity values, compute for each pixel p with p > 0: d = ( float(p) - 1. ) / 256., while a value p = 0 is an invalid measurement. warning: the images are stored as 16-bit pngs, which is non-standard and not supported by all libraries.\n - `camera`        internal and external camera calibration. for details, please refer to [cscalibration.pdf](docs/cscalibration.pdf)\n - `vehicle`       vehicle odometry, gps coordinates, and outside temperature. for details, please refer to [cscalibration.pdf](docs/cscalibration.pdf)\n\nmore types might be added over time and also not all types are initially available. please let us know if you need any other meta-data to run your approach.\n\npossible values of `split`\n - `train`       usually used for training, contains 2975 images with fine and coarse annotations\n - `val`         should be used for validation of hyper-parameters, contains 500 image with fine and coarse annotations. can also be used for training.\n - `test`        used for testing on our evaluation server. the annotations are not public, but we include annotations of ego-vehicle and rectification border for convenience.\n - `train_extra` can be optionally used for training, contains 19998 images with coarse annotations\n - `demovideo`   video sequences that could be used for qualitative evaluation, no annotations are available for these videos\n\n\n## scripts\n\n### installation\n\ninstall `cityscapesscripts` with `pip`\n```\npython -m pip install cityscapesscripts\n```\n\ngraphical tools (viewer and label tool) are based on qt5 and can be installed via\n```\npython -m pip install cityscapesscripts[gui]\n```\n\n### usage\n\nthe installation installs the cityscapes scripts as a python module named `cityscapesscripts` and exposes the following tools\n- `csdownload`: download the cityscapes packages via command line.\n- `csviewer`: view the images and overlay the annotations.\n- `cslabeltool`: tool that we used for labeling.\n- `csevalpixellevelsemanticlabeling`: evaluate pixel-level semantic labeling results on the validation set. this tool is also used to evaluate the results on the test set.\n- `csevalinstancelevelsemanticlabeling`: evaluate instance-level semantic labeling results on the validation set. this tool is also used to evaluate the results on the test set.\n- `csevalpanopticsemanticlabeling`: evaluate panoptic segmentation results on the validation set. this tool is also used to evaluate the results on the test set.\n- `csevalobjectdetection3d`: evaluate 3d object detection on the validation set. this tool is also used to evaluate the results on the test set.\n- `cscreatetrainidlabelimgs`: convert annotations in polygonal format to png images with label ids, where pixels encode \"train ids\" that you can define in `labels.py`.\n- `cscreatetrainidinstanceimgs`: convert annotations in polygonal format to png images with instance ids, where pixels encode instance ids composed of \"train ids\".\n- `cscreatepanopticimgs`: convert annotations in standard png format to [coco panoptic segmentation format](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data).\n- `csplot3ddetectionresults`: visualize 3d object detection evaluation results stored in .json format.\n\n\n### package content\n\nthe package is structured as follows\n -
