  "description": "## websockify: websockets support for any application/server\n\nwebsockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the\n[novnc](https://github.com/novnc/novnc) project.\n\nat the most basic level, websockify just translates websockets traffic\nto normal socket traffic. websockify accepts the websockets handshake,\nparses it, and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and\nthe target in both directions.\n\n### news/help/contact\n\nnotable commits, announcements and news are posted to\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/novnc\">@novnc</a>\n\nif you are a websockify developer/integrator/user (or want to be)\nplease join the <a\nhref=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/novnc\">novnc/websockify\ndiscussion group</a>\n\nbugs and feature requests can be submitted via [github\nissues](https://github.com/novnc/websockify/issues).\n\nif you want to show appreciation for websockify you could donate to a great\nnon-profits such as: [compassion\ninternational](http://www.compassion.com/), [sil](http://www.sil.org),\n[habitat for humanity](http://www.habitat.org), [electronic frontier\nfoundation](https://www.eff.org/), [against malaria\nfoundation](http://www.againstmalaria.com/), [nothing but\nnets](http://www.nothingbutnets.net/), etc. please tweet <a\nhref=\"http://www.twitter.com/novnc\">@novnc</a> if you do.\n\n### websockets binary data\n\nstarting with websockify 0.5.0, only the hybi / ietf\n6455 websocket protocol is supported. there is no support for the older\nbase64 encoded data format.\n\n\n### encrypted websocket connections (wss://)\n\nto encrypt the traffic using the websocket 'wss://' uri scheme you need to\ngenerate a certificate and key for websockify to load. by default, websockify\nloads a certificate file name `self.pem` but the `--cert=cert` and `--key=key`\noptions can override the file name. you can generate a self-signed certificate\nusing openssl. when asked for the common name, use the hostname of the server\nwhere the proxy will be running:\n\n```\nopenssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out self.pem -keyout self.pem\n```\n\nfor a self-signed certificate to work, you need to make your client/browser\nunderstand it. you can do this by installing it as accepted certificate, or by\nusing that same certificate for a https connection to which you navigate first\nand approve. browsers generally don't give you the \"trust certificate?\" prompt\nby opening a wss socket with invalid certificate, hence you need to have it\naccept it by either of those two methods.\n\nif you have a commercial/valid ssl certificate with one or more intermediate\ncertificates, concat them into one file, server certificate first, then the\nintermediate(s) from the ca, etc. point to this file with the `--cert` option\nand then also to the key with `--key`. finally, use `--ssl-only` as needed.\n\n\n### additional websockify features\n\nthese are not necessary for the basic operation.\n\n* daemonizing: when the `-d` option is specified, websockify runs\n  in the background as a daemon process.\n\n* ssl (the wss:// websockets uri): this is detected automatically by\n  websockify by sniffing the first byte sent from the client and then\n  wrapping the socket if the data starts with '\\x16' or '\\x80'\n  (indicating ssl).\n\n* session recording: this feature that allows recording of the traffic\n  sent and received from the client to a file using the `--record`\n  option.\n\n* mini-webserver: websockify can detect and respond to normal web\n  requests on the same port as the websockets proxy. this functionality\n  is activated with the `--web dir` option where dir is the root of the\n  web directory to serve.\n\n* wrap a program: see the \"wrap a program\" section below.\n\n* log files: websockify can save all logging information in a file.\n  this functionality is activated with the `--log-file file` option\n  where file is the file where the logs should be saved.\n\n* authentication plugins: websockify can demand authentication for\n  websocket connections and, if you use `--web-auth`, also for normal\n  web requests. this functionality is activated with the\n  `--auth-plugin class` and `--auth-source arg` options, where class is\n  usually one from auth_plugins.py and arg is the plugin's configuration.\n\n* token plugins: a single instance of websockify can connect clients to\n  multiple different pre-configured targets, depending on the token sent\n  by the client using the `token` url parameter, or the hostname used to\n  reach websockify, if you use `--host-token`. this functionality is\n  activated with the `--token-plugin class` and `--token-source arg`\n  options, where class is usually one from token_plugins.py and arg is\n  the plugin's configuration.\n\n### other implementations of websockify\n\nthe primary implementation of websockify is in python. there are\nseveral alternate implementations in other languages available in\nour sister repositories [websockify-js](https://github.com/novnc/websockify-js)\n(javascript/node.js) and [websockify-other](https://github.com/novnc/websockify-other)\n (c, clojure, ruby).\n\nin addition there are several other external projects that implement\nthe websockify \"protocol\". see the alternate implementation [feature\nmatrix](https://github.com/novnc/websockify/wiki/feature_matrix) for\nmore information.\n\n\n### wrap a program\n\nin addition to proxying from a source address to a target address\n(which may be on a different system), websockify has the ability to\nlaunch a program on the local system and proxy websockets traffic to\na normal tcp port owned/bound by the program.\n\nthis is accomplished by the ld_preload library (`rebind.so`)\nwhich intercepts bind() system calls by the program. the specified\nport is moved to a new localhost/loopback free high port. websockify\nthen proxies websockets traffic directed to the original port to the\nnew (moved) port of the program.\n\nthe program wrap mode is invoked by replacing the target with `--`\nfollowed by the program command line to wrap.\n\n    `./run 2023 -- program args`\n\nthe `--wrap-mode` option can be used to indicate what action to take\nwhen the wrapped program exits or daemonizes.\n\nhere is an example of using websockify to wrap the vncserver command\n(which backgrounds itself) for use with\n[novnc](https://github.com/novnc/novnc):\n\n    `./run 5901 --wrap-mode=ignore -- vncserver -geometry 1024x768 :1`\n\nhere is an example of wrapping telnetd (from krb5-telnetd). telnetd\nexits after the connection closes so the wrap mode is set to respawn\nthe command:\n\n    `sudo ./run 2023 --wrap-mode=respawn -- telnetd -debug 2023`\n\nthe `wstelnet.html` page in the [websockify-js](https://github.com/novnc/websockify-js)\nproject demonstrates a simple websockets based telnet client (use\n'localhost' and '2023' for the host and port respectively).\n\n\n### installing websockify\n\ndownload one of the releases or the latest development version, extract\nit and run `python3 setup.py install` as root in the directory where you\nextracted the files. normally, this will also install numpy for better\nperformance, if you don't have it installed already. however, numpy is\noptional. if you don't want to install numpy or if you can't compile it,\nyou can edit setup.py and remove the `install_requires=['numpy'],` line\nbefore running `python3 setup.py install`.\n\nafterwards, websockify should be available in your path. run\n`websockify --help` to confirm it's installed correctly.\n\n\n### running with docker/podman\nyou can also run websockify using docker, podman, singularity, udocker or\nyour favourite container runtime that support oci container images.\n\nthe entrypoint of the image is the `run` command.\n\nto build the image:\n```\n./docker/build.sh\n```\n\nonce built you can just launch it with the same\narguments you would give to the `run` command and taking care of\nassigning the port mappings:\n```\ndocker run -it --rm -p <port>:<container_port> novnc/websockify <container_port> <run_arguments>\n```\n\nfor example to forward traffic from local port 7000 to 10.1.1.1:5902\nyou can use:\n```\ndocker run -it --rm -p 7000:80 novnc/websockify 80 10.1.1.1:5902\n```\n\nif you need to include files, like for example for the `--web` or `--cert`\noptions you can just mount the required files in the `/data` volume and then\nyou can reference them in the usual way:\n```\ndocker run -it --rm -p 443:443 -v websockify-data:/data novnc/websockify --cert /data/self.pem --web /data/novnc :443 --token-plugin tokenredis --token-source myredis.local:6379 --ssl-only --ssl-version tlsv1_2\n```\n\nchanges\n=======\n\n0.11.0\n------\n\n* command line now supports disabling directory listings\n* basic dockerfile
