  "description": "# django smart selects\n\n[![jazzband](https://jazzband.co/static/img/badge.svg)](https://jazzband.co/)\n[![build status](https://github.com/jazzband/django-smart-selects/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jazzband/django-smart-selects/actions)\n[![coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/jazzband/django-smart-selects/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/jazzband/django-smart-selects)\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-smart-selects.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/django-smart-selects/)\n\nthis package allows you to quickly filter or group \"chained\" models by adding a custom foreign key or many to many field to your models. this will use an ajax query to load only the applicable chained objects.\n\nworks with django version 2.2 to 4.0.\n\n**warning**: the ajax endpoint enforces no permissions by default.  this means that **any model with a chained field will be world readable**. if you would like more control over this permission, the [`django-autocomplete-light`](https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light) package is a great, high-quality package that enables the same functionality with permission checks.\n\n## documentation\n\nfor more information on installation and configuration see the documentation at:\n\nhttps://django-smart-selects.readthedocs.io/\n\n## reporting issues / sending prs\n\nyou can try the test_app example using:\n\n```shell\npython manage.py migrate\npython manage.py loaddata test_app/fixtures/*\npython manage.py runserver\n```\n\nthen login with admin/admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/\n\n\n## todo\n\n* add permission checks to enable users to restrict who can use the chained fields.\n* add a `chainedcheckboxselectmultiple` widget and adjust `chainedm2m.js` and `chainedfk.js` to build checkboxes in that case\n",
