  "description": "\npexpect is a pure python module for spawning child applications; controlling\nthem; and responding to expected patterns in their output. pexpect works like\ndon libes' expect. pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and\ncontrol it as if a human were typing commands.\n\npexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp,\npasswd, telnet, etc. it can be used to automate setup scripts for duplicating\nsoftware package installations on different servers. it can be used for\nautomated software testing. pexpect is in the spirit of don libes' expect, but\npexpect is pure python.\n\nthe main features of pexpect require the pty module in the python standard\nlibrary, which is only available on unix-like systems. some features\u2014waiting\nfor patterns from file descriptors or subprocesses\u2014are also available on\nwindows.\n",
