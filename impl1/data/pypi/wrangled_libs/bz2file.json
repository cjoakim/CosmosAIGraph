  "description": "bz2file is a python library for reading and writing bzip2-compressed files.\n\nit contains a drop-in replacement for the file interface in the standard\nlibrary's ``bz2`` module, including features from the latest development\nversion of cpython that are not available in older releases.\n\nbz2file is compatible with cpython 2.6, 2.7, and 3.0 through 3.4, as well as\npypy 2.0.\n\n\nfeatures\n--------\n\n- supports multi-stream files.\n\n- can read from or write to any file-like object.\n\n- can open files in either text or binary mode.\n\n- added methods: ``peek()``, ``read1()``, ``readinto()``, ``fileno()``,\n  ``readable()``, ``writable()``, ``seekable()``.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nto install bz2file, run: ::\n\n   $ pip install bz2file\n\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nthe ``open()`` function and ``bz2file`` class in this module provide the same\nfeatures and interface as the ones in the standard library's ``bz2`` module in\nthe current development version of cpython, `documented here\n<http://docs.python.org/dev/library/bz2.html>`_.\n\n\nversion history\n---------------\n\n0.98: 19 january 2014\n\n- added support for the 'x' family of modes.\n- ignore non-bz2 data at the end of a file, rather than raising an exception.\n- tests now pass on pypy.\n\n0.95: 08 october 2012\n\n- added the ``open()`` function.\n- improved performance when reading in small chunks.\n- removed the ``fileobj`` argument to ``bz2file()``. to wrap an existing file\n  object, pass it as the first argument (``filename``).\n\n0.9: 04 february 2012\n\n- initial release.",
