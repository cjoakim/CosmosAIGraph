it outside the kernel,\n  i.e., permitting competing implementations, would prevent the implementation of the\n  system's required functionality.\n\n  -- jochen liedtke, liedtke's minimality principle\n\npg8000 is designed to be used with one thread per connection.\n\npg8000 communicates with the database using the `postgresql frontend/backend protocol\n<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol.html>`_ (febe). if a query has no\nparameters, pg8000 uses the 'simple query protocol'. if a query does have parameters,\npg8000 uses the 'extended query protocol' with unnamed prepared statements. the steps\nfor a query with parameters are:\n\n1. query comes in.\n\n#. send a parse message to the server to create an unnamed prepared statement.\n\n#. send a bind message to run against the unnamed prepared statement, resulting in an\n   unnamed portal on the server.\n\n#. send an execute message to read all the results from the portal.\n\nit's also possible to use named prepared statements. in which case the prepared\nstatement persists on the server, and represented in pg8000 using a\n``preparedstatement`` object. this means that the parse step gets executed once up\nfront, and then only the bind and execute steps are repeated subsequently.\n\nthere are a lot of postgresql data types, but few primitive data types in python. by\ndefault, pg8000 doesn't send postgresql data type information in the parse step, in\nwhich case postgresql assumes the types implied by the sql statement. in some cases\npostgresql can't work out a parameter type and so an `explicit cast\n<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-expressions.html#sql-syntax-type-casts>`_\ncan be used in the sql.\n\nin the febe protocol, each query parameter can be sent to the server either as binary\nor text according to the format code. in pg8000 the parameters are always sent as text.\n\noccasionally, the network connection between pg8000 and the server may go down. if\npg8000 encounters a network problem it'll raise an ``interfaceerror`` with the message\n``network error`` and with the original exception set as the `cause\n<https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement>`_.\n\n\nnative api docs\n---------------\n\npg8000.native.error\n```````````````````\n\ngeneric exception that is

``user`` as bytes,\n  eg. ``'my_name'.encode('euc-jp')``.\n\nhost\n  the hostname of the postgresql server to connect with. providing this parameter is\n  necessary for tcp/ip connections. one of either ``host`` or ``unix_sock`` must be\n  provided. the default is ``localhost``.\n\ndatabase\n  the name of the database instance to connect with. if ``none`` then the postgresql\n  server will assume the database name is the same as the username. if your server\n  character encoding is not ``ascii`` or ``utf8``, then you need to provide ``database``\n  as bytes, eg. ``'my_db'.encode('euc-jp')``.\n\nport\n  the tcp/ip port of the postgresql server instance.  this parameter defaults to\n  ``5432``, the registered common port of postgresql tcp/ip servers.\n\npassword\n  the user password to connect to the server with. this parameter is optional; if\n  omitted and the database server requests password-based authentication, the connection\n  will fail to open. if this parameter is provided but not\n  requested by the server, no error will occur.\n\n  if your server character encoding is not ``ascii`` or ``utf8``, then you need to\n  provide ``password`` as bytes, eg.  ``'my_password'.encode('euc-jp')``.\n\nsource_address\n  the source ip address which initiates the connection to the postgresql server. the\n  default is ``none`` which means that the operating system will choose the source\n  address.\n\nunix_sock\n  the path to the unix socket to access the database through, for example,\n  ``'/tmp/.s.pgsql.5432'``. one of either ``host`` or ``unix_sock`` must be provided.\n\nssl_context\n  this governs ssl encryption for tcp/ip sockets. it can have three values:\n\n  - ``none``, meaning no ssl (the default)\n\n  - ``true``, means use ssl with an |ssl.sslcontext|_ created using\n    |ssl.create_default_context()|_\n\n  - an instance of |ssl.sslcontext|_ which will be used to create the ssl connection.\n\n  if your postgresql server is behind an ssl proxy, you can set the pg8000-specific\n  attribute ``ssl.sslcontext.request_ssl = false``, which tells pg8000 to use an ssl\n  socket, but not to request ssl from the postgresql server. note that this means you\n  can't use scram authentication with channel binding.\n\ntimeout\n  this is the time in seconds before the connection to the server will time out. the\n  default is ``none`` which means no timeout.\n\ntcp_keepalive\n  if ``true`` then use `tcp keepalive\n  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keepalive#tcp_keepalive>`_. the default is ``true``.\n\napplication_name\n  sets the `application_name\n  <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#guc-application-name>`_.\n  if your server character encoding is not ``ascii`` or ``utf8``, then you need to\n  provide values as bytes, eg.  ``'my_application_name'.encode('euc-jp')``. the default\n  is ``none`` which means that the server will set the application name.\n\nreplication\n  used to run in `streaming replication mode\n  <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-replication.html>`_. if your server\n  character encoding is not ``ascii`` or ``utf8``, then you need to provide values as\n  bytes, eg. ``'database'.encode('euc-jp')``.\n\nsock\n  a socket-like object to use for the connection. for example, ``sock`` could be a plain\n  ``socket.socket``, or it could represent an ssh tunnel or perhaps an\n  ``ssl.sslsocket`` to an ssl proxy. if an |ssl.sslcontext| is provided, then it will be\n  used to attempt to create an ssl

each value contains\ninformation describing one result column. the 7 items returned for each column are\n(name, type_code, display_size, internal_size, precision, scale, null_ok). only the\nfirst two values are provided by the current implementation.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.close()\n'''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\ncloses the cursor.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.execute(operation, args=none, stream=none)\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nexecutes a database operation. parameters may be provided as a sequence, or as a\nmapping, depending upon the value of ``pg8000.dbapi.paramstyle``. returns the cursor,\nwhich may be iterated over.\n\noperation\n  the sql statement to execute.\n\nargs\n  if ``pg8000.dbapi.paramstyle`` is ``qmark``, ``numeric``, or ``format``, this\n  argument should be an array of parameters to bind into the statement. if\n  ``pg8000.dbapi.paramstyle`` is ``named``, the argument should be a ``dict`` mapping of\n  parameters. if ``pg8000.dbapi.paramstyle`` is ``pyformat``, the argument value may be\n  either an array or a mapping.\n\nstream\n  this is a pg8000 extension for use with the postgresql `copy\n  <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-copy.html>`__ command. for a\n  ``copy from`` the parameter must be a readable file-like object, and for ``copy to``\n  it must be writable.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.executemany(operation, param_sets)\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nprepare a database operation, and then execute it against all parameter sequences or\nmappings provided.\n\noperation\n  the sql statement to execute.\n\nparameter_sets\n  a sequence of parameters to execute the statement with. the values in the sequence\n  should be sequences or mappings of parameters, the same as the args argument of the\n  ``pg8000.dbapi.cursor.execute()`` method.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.callproc(procname, parameters=none)\n'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\ncall a stored database procedure with the given name and optional parameters.\n\n\nprocname\n  the name of the procedure to call.\n\nparameters\n  a list of parameters.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.fetchall()\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nfetches all remaining rows of a query result.\n\nreturns: a sequence, each entry of which is a sequence of field values making up a row.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.fetchmany(size=none)\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nfetches the next set of rows of a query result.\n\nsize\n  the number of rows to fetch when called.  if not provided, the\n  ``pg8000.dbapi.cursor.arraysize`` attribute value is used instead.\n\nreturns: a sequence, each entry of which is a sequence of field values making up a row.\nif no more rows are available, an empty sequence will be returned.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.fetchone()\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nfetch the next row of a query result set.\n\nreturns: a row as a sequence of field values, or ``none`` if no more rows are available.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.setinputsizes(\\*sizes)\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nused to set the parameter types of the next query. this is useful if it's difficult for\npg8000 to work out the types from the parameters themselves (eg. for parameters of type\nnone).\n\nsizes\n  positional parameters that are either the python type of the parameter to be sent, or\n  the postgresql oid. common oids are available as constants such as ``pg8000.string``,\n  ``pg8000.integer``, ``pg8000.time`` etc.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.cursor.setoutputsize(size, column=none)\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nnot implemented by pg8000.\n\n\npg8000.dbapi.interval\n'''''''''''''''''''''\n\nan interval represents a measurement of time.  in postgresql, an interval is defined in\nthe measure of months, days, and microseconds; as such, the pg8000 interval type\nrepresents the same information.\n\nnote that values of the ``pg8000.dbapi.interval.microseconds``,\n``pg8000.dbapi.interval.days``, and ``pg8000.dbapi.interval.months`` properties are\nindependently measured and cannot be converted to each other. a month may be 28, 29, 30,\nor 31 days, and a day may occasionally be lengthened slightly by a leap second.\n\n\ndesign decisions\n----------------\n\nfor the ``range`` type, the constructor follows the `postgresql range constructor functions <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html#rangetypes-construct>`_\nwhich makes `[closed, open) <https://fhur.me/posts/always-use-closed-open-intervals>`_\nthe easiest to express:\n\n>>> from pg8000.types import range\n>>>\n>>> pg_range = range(2, 6)\n\n\ntests\n-----\n\n- install `tox <http://testrun.org/tox/latest/>`_: ``pip install tox``\n\n- enable the postgresql hstore extension by running the sql command:\n  ``create extension hstore;``\n\n- add a line to ``pg_hba.conf`` for the various authentication options:\n\n::\n\n  host    pg8000_md5           all        127.0.0.1/32            md5\n  host    pg8000_gss           all        127.0.0.1/32            gss\n  host    pg8000_password      all        127.0.0.1/32            password\n  host    pg8000_scram_sha_256 all        127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256\n  host    all                  all        127.0.0.1/32            trust\n\n- set password encryption to ``scram-sha-256`` in ``postgresql.conf``:\n  ``password_encryption = 'scram-sha-256'``\n\n- set the password for the postgres user: ``alter user postgresql with password 'pw';``\n\n- run ``tox`` from the ``pg8000`` directory: ``tox``\n\nthis will run the tests against the python version of the virtual environment, on the\nmachine, and the installed postgresql version listening on port 5432, or the ``pgport``\nenvironment variable if set.\n\nbenchmarks are run as part of the test suite at ``tests/test_benchmarks.py``.\n\n\nreadme.rst\n----------\n\nthis file is written in the `restructuredtext\n<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_ format. to generate an\nhtml page from it, do:\n\n- activate the virtual environment: ``source venv/bin/activate``\n- install ``sphinx``: ``pip install sphinx``\n- run ``rst2html.py``: ``rst2html.py readme.rst readme.html``\n\n\ndoing a release of pg8000\n-------------------------\n\nrun ``tox`` to make sure all tests pass, then update the release notes, then do:\n\n::\n\n  git tag -a x.y.z -m \"version x.y.z\"\n  rm -r dist\n  python -m build\n  twine upload dist/*\n\n\nrelease notes\n-------------\n\nversion 1.30.3, 2023-10-31\n``````````````````````````\n\n- fix problem with pg date overflowing python types. now we return the ``str`` we got from the\n  server if we can't parse it. \n\n\nversion 1.30.2, 2023-09-17\n``````````````````````````\n\n- bug fix where dollar-quoted string constants weren't supported.\n\n\nversion 1.30.1, 2023-07-29\n``````````````````````````\n\n- there was a problem uploading the previous version (1.30.0) to pypi because the\n  markup of the readme.rst was invalid. there's now a step in the automated tests to\n  check for this.\n\n\nversion 1.30.0, 2023-07-27\n``````````````````````````\n\n- remove support for python 3.7\n\n- add a ``sock`` keyword parameter for creating a connection from a pre-configured\n  socket.\n\n\nversion 1.29.8, 2023-06-16\n``````````````````````````\n\n- ranges don't work with legacy api.\n\n\nversion 1.29.7, 2023-06-16\n``````````````````````````\n\n- add support for postgresql ``range`` and ``multirange`` types. previously pg8000\n  would just return them as strings, but now they're returned as ``range`` and lists of\n  ``range``.\n\n- the postgresql ``record`` type is now returned as a ``tuple`` of strings, whereas\n  before it was returned as one string.\n\n\nversion 1.29.6, 2023-05-29\n``````````````````````````\n\n- fixed two bugs with composite types. nulls should be represented by an empty string,\n  and in an array of composite types, the elements should be surrounded by double\n  quotes.\n\n\nversion 1.29.5, 2023-05-09\n``````````````````````````\n\n- fixed bug where pg8000 didn't handle the case when the number of bytes received from\n  a socket was fewer than requested. this was being interpreted as a network error, but\n  in fact we just needed to wait until more bytes were available.\n\n- when using the ``pginterval`` type, if a response from the server contained the period\n  ``millennium``, it wasn't recognised. this was caused by a spelling mistake where we\n  had ``millenium`` rather than ``millennium``.\n\n- added support for sending postgresql composite types. if a value is sent as a\n  ``tuple``, pg8000 will send it to the server as a ``(`` delimited composite string.\n\n\nversion 1.29.4, 2022-12-14\n``````````````````````````\n\n- fixed bug in ``pg8000.dbapi`` in the ``setinputsizes()`` method where if a ``size``\n  was a recognized python type, the method failed.\n\n\nversion 1.29.3, 2022-10-26\n``````````````````````````\n\n- upgrade the scram library to version 1.4.3. this adds support for the case where the\n  client supports channel binding but the server doesn't.\n\n\nversion 1.29.2, 2022-10-09\n``````````````````````````\n\n- fixed a bug where in a literal array, items such as ``\\n`` and ``\\r`` weren't\n  escaped properly before being sent to the server.\n\n- fixed a bug where if the postgresql server has a half-hour time zone set, values of\n  type ``timestamp with time zone`` failed. this has been fixed by using the ``parse``\n  function of the ``dateutil`` package if the ``datetime`` parser fails.\n\n\nversion 1.29.1, 2022-05-23\n``````````````````````````\n\n- in trying to determine if there's been a failed commit, check for ``rollback to\n  savepoint``.\n\n\nversion 1.29.0, 2022-05-21\n``````````````````````````\n\n- implement a workaround for the `silent failed commit\n  <https://github.com/tlocke/pg8000/issues/36>`_ bug.\n\n- previously if an empty string was sent as the query an exception would be raised, but\n  that isn't done now.\n\n\nversion 1.28.3, 2022-05-18\n``````````````````````````\n\n- put back ``__version__`` attributes that were inadvertently removed.\n\n\nversion 1.28.2, 2022-05-17\n``````````````````````````\n\n- use a build system that's compliant with pep517.\n\n\nversion 1.28.1, 2022-05-17\n``````````````````````````\n\n- if when doing a ``copy from`` the ``stream`` parameter is an iterator of ``str``,\n  pg8000 used to silently append a newline to the end. that no longer happens.\n\n\nversion 1.28.0, 2022-05-17\n``````````````````````````\n\n- when using the ``copy from`` sql statement, allow the ``stream`` parameter to be an\n  iterable.\n\n\nversion 1.27.1, 2022-05-16\n``````````````````````````\n\n- the ``seconds`` attribute of ``pginterval`` is now always a ``float``, to cope with\n  fractional seconds.\n\n- updated the ``interval`` parsers for ``iso_8601`` and ``sql_standard`` to take\n  account of fractional seconds.\n\n\nversion 1.27.0, 2022-05-16\n``````````````````````````\n\n- it used to be that by default, if pg8000 received an ``interval`` type from the server\n  and it was too big to fit into a ``datetime.timedelta`` then an exception would be\n  raised. now if an interval is too big for ``datetime.timedelta`` a ``pginterval`` is\n  returned.\n\n* pg8000 now supports all the output formats for an ``interval`` (``postgres``,\n  ``postgres_verbose``, ``iso_8601`` and ``sql_standard``).\n\n\nversion 1.26.1, 2022-04-23\n``````````````````````````\n\n- make sure all tests are run by the github actions tests on commit.\n- remove support for python 3.6\n- remove support for postgresql 9.6\n\n\nversion 1.26.0, 2022-04-18\n``````````````````````````\n\n- when connecting, raise an ``interfaceerror('network error')`` rather than let the\n  underlying ``struct.error`` float up.\n\n- make licence text the same as that used by the osi. previously the licence wording\n  differed slightly from the bsd 3 clause licence at\n  https://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-3-clause. this meant that automated tools didn't\n  pick it up as being open source. the changes are believed to not alter the meaning of   the license at all.\n\n\nversion 1.25.0, 2022-04-17\n``````````````````````````\n\n- fix more cases where a ``resourcewarning`` would be raise because of a socket that had\n  been left open.\n\n- we now have a single ``interfaceerror`` with the message 'network error' for all\n  network errors, with the underlying exception held in the ``cause`` of the exception.\n\n\nversion 1.24.2, 2022-04-15\n``````````````````````````\n\n- to prevent a ``resourcewarning`` close socket if a connection can't be created.\n\n\nversion 1.24.1, 2022-03-02\n``````````````````````````\n\n- return pg +/-infinity dates as ``str``. previously +/-infinity pg values would cause\n  an error when returned, but now we return +/-infinity as strings.\n\n\nversion 1.24.0, 2022-02-06\n``````````````````````````\n\n- add sql escape functions identifier() and literal() to the native api. for use when a\n  query can't be parameterised and the sql string has to be created using untrusted\n  values.\n\n\nversion 1.23.0, 2021-11-13\n``````````````````````````\n\n- if a query has no parameters, then the query will no longer be parsed. although there\n  are performance benefits for doing this, the main reason is to avoid query rewriting,\n  which can introduce errors.\n\n\nversion 1.22.1, 2021-11-10\n``````````````````````````\n\n- fix bug in pginterval type where ``str()`` failed for a millennia value.\n\n\nversion 1.22.0, 2021-10-13\n``````````````````````````\n\n- rather than specifying the oids in the ``parse`` step of the postgres protocol, pg8000\n  now omits them, and so postgres will use the oids it determines from the query. this\n  makes the pg8000 code simpler and also it should also make the nuances of type\n  matching more straightforward.\n",
