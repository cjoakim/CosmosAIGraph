  "description": "[![build status](https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv-python/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv-python/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n[![package version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hsluv.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hsluv/)\n\na python implementation of [hsluv](https://www.hsluv.org) (revision 4).\n\n## installation\n\n`pip install hsluv`\n\npython 2 users: `pip install hsluv==5.0.0`\n\n## usage\n\n> this library does not hide (clamp) floating point error, e.g. you might receive a value outside\n> of the expected range. if you wish to display the outputs of this library, consider rounding them \n> for your purpose. the floating point error has not been quantified, but at least 10 decimal digits \n> should be free of it.\n\n### `hsluv_to_hex([hue, saturation, lightness])`\n\n`hue` is a float between 0 and 360, `saturation` and `lightness` are floats between 0 and 100. this \nfunction returns the resulting color as a hex string.\n\n### `hsluv_to_rgb([hue, saturation, lightness])`\n\nlike above, but returns a list of 3 floats between 0 and 1, for each rgb channel.\n\n### `hex_to_hsluv(hex)`\n\ntakes a hex string and returns the hsluv color as a list of floats as defined above.\n\n### `rgb_to_hsluv([red, green, blue])`\n\nlike above, but `red`, `green` and `blue` are passed as floats between 0 and 1.\n\nfor hpluv (the pastel variant), use `hpluv_to_hex`, `hpluv_to_rgb`, `hex_to_hpluv` and `rgb_to_hpluv`.\n\n## testing\n\nrun `python setup.py test`.\n\n## authors\n\n* robert mcginley ([mcginleyr1](https://github.com/mcginleyr1))\n* alexei boronine ([boronine](https://github.com/boronine))\n\n\n\n",
