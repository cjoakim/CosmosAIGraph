  "description": "# graphlib backport\n\nbackport of the python 3.9\n[graphlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html)\nmodule for older python versions.\n\ngithub:\n[https://github.com/mariushelf/graphlib_backport](https://github.com/mariushelf/graphlib_backport)\n\n# supported versions\n\nthis backport currently support python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and and pypy3\n(tested with pypy3.6).\n\n\n# installation\n\n`pip install graphlib_backport`\n\n# usage\n\nthe package works the very same way as the original package.\n[here's](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html) the documentation.\n\n\n# development\n\nthe sourcecode is hosted on\n[github](https://github.com/mariushelf/graphlib_backports).\nto develop on this package, just clone it, work on it and submit a pull request.\n\n\n## dev requirements\n\nfor testing against different python versions, [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\nis required.\n\nto download the latest original sourcecode into the repository, there is a make target:\n\n`make download_sourcecode`\n\n*warning*: this overwrites the code in this repo. by default it uses the tag `v3.9.0`,\nbut you can overwrite that with a `tag` environment variable.\n\n\n## running tests\n\nas simple as running `tox` on the command line.\n\nthe executables for all python versions must be in the path, e.g,\n`python3.6`, ..., `python3.9`, `pypy3`.\nyou can install them with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).\n\n\n## publishing a new version\n\nupdate the version in the pyproject.toml and run `make publish` to build and upload\nthe package ti pypi.\n\n\n# thanks\n\ni did not create this code -- i only repackaged it so it can be\npip-installed into older versions of python.\n\nso all thanks go to the original contributors of the\n[original sourcecode](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/lib/graphlib.py).\n\n\n# license\n\n[psf](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html#psf-license)\n\n\n",
