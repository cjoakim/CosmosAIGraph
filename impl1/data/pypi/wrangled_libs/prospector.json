r0922\n        abstract class is only referenced 1 times\n\noptions\n```````\n\nrun ``prospector --help`` for a full list of options and their effects.\n\noutput format\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nthe default output format of ``prospector`` is designed to be human readable. for parsing\n(for example, for reporting), you can use the ``--output-format json`` flag to get json-formatted\noutput.\n\nprofiles\n~~~~~~~~\n\nprospector is configurable using \"profiles\". these are composable yaml files with directives to\ndisable or enable tools or messages. for more information, read\n`the documentation about profiles <https://prospector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiles.html>`_.\n\nif your code uses frameworks and libraries\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\noften tools such as pylint find errors in code which is not an error, for example due to attributes of classes being\ncreated at run time by a library or framework used by your project.\nfor example, by default, pylint will generate an error for django models when accessing ``objects``, as the\n``objects`` attribute is not part of the ``model`` class definition.\n\nprospector mitigates this by providing an understanding of these frameworks to the underlying tools.\n\nprospector will try to intuit which libraries your project uses by\n`detecting dependencies <https://github.com/landscapeio/requirements-detector>`_ and automatically turning on\nsupport for the requisite libraries. you can see which adaptors were run in the metadata section of the report.\n\nif prospector does not correctly detect your project's dependencies, you can specify them manually from the commandline::\n\n    prospector --uses django celery\n\nadditionally, if prospector is automatically detecting a library that you do not in fact use, you can turn\noff autodetection completely::\n\n    prospector --no-autodetect\n\nnote that as far as possible, these adaptors have been written as plugins or augmentations for the underlying\ntools so that they can be used without requiring prospector. for example, the django support is available as a pylint plugin.\n\nstrictness\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nprospector has a configurable 'strictness' level which will determine how harshly it searches for errors::\n\n    prospector --strictness high\n\npossible values are ``verylow``, ``low``, ``medium``, ``high``, ``veryhigh``.\n\nprospector does not include documentation warnings by default, but you can turn\nthis on using the ``--doc-warnings`` flag.\n\npre-commit\n----------\n\nif you'd like prospector to be run automatically when making changes to files in your git\nrepository, you can install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ and add the following\ntext to your repositories' ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``::\n\n    repos:\n    -   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/prospector\n        rev: 1.10.0 # the version of prospector to use, if not 'master' for latest\n        hooks:\n        -   id: prospector\n\nthis only installs base prospector - if you also use optional tools, for example bandit and/or mypy, then you can add\nthem to the hook configuration like so::\n\n    repos:\n    -   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/prospector\n        rev: 1.10.0\n        hooks:\n        -   id: prospector\n            additional_dependencies:\n            - \".[with_mypy,with_bandit]\"\n          - args: [\n            '--with-tool=mypy',\n            '--with-tool=bandit',\n            ]\n\nadditional dependencies can be `individually configured <https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/profiles.html#individual-configuration-options>`_ in your `prospector.yml` file ::\n\n    # https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html\n    bandit:\n    options:\n        skips:\n        - b201\n        - b601\n        - b610\n        - b611\n        - b703\n\n    # https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html\n    mypy:\n    options:\n        ignore-missing-imports: true\n\nfor prospector options which affect display only - those which are not configurable using a profile - these can be\nadded as command line arguments to the hook. for example::\n\n    repos:\n    -   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/prospector\n        rev: 1.10.0\n        hooks:\n        -   id: prospector\n            additional_dependencies:\n            -   \".[with_mypy,with_bandit]\"\n            args:\n            -   --with-tool=mypy\n            -   --with-tool=bandit\n            -   --summary-only\n            -   --zero-exit\n\n\n\nlicense\n-------\n\nprospector is available under the gplv2 license.\n\n",
