  "description": "\ncvxopt is a free software package for convex optimization based on the\npython programming language. it can be used with the interactive python\ninterpreter, on the command line by executing python scripts, or\nintegrated in other software via python extension modules. its main\npurpose is to make the development of software for convex optimization\napplications straightforward by building on python's extensive standard\nlibrary and on the strengths of python as a high-level programming\nlanguage.\n",
