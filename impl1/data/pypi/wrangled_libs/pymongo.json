  "description": "=======\npymongo\n=======\n:info: see `the mongo site <http://www.mongodb.org>`_ for more information. see `github <http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver>`_ for the latest source.\n:documentation: available at `pymongo.readthedocs.io <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_\n:author: the mongodb python team\n\nabout\n=====\n\nthe pymongo distribution contains tools for interacting with mongodb\ndatabase from python.  the ``bson`` package is an implementation of\nthe `bson format <http://bsonspec.org>`_ for python. the ``pymongo``\npackage is a native python driver for mongodb. the ``gridfs`` package\nis a `gridfs\n<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/gridfs/gridfs-spec.rst/>`_\nimplementation on top of ``pymongo``.\n\npymongo supports mongodb 3.6, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0.\n\nsupport / feedback\n==================\n\nfor issues with, questions about, or feedback for pymongo, please look into\nour `support channels <https://support.mongodb.com/welcome>`_. please\ndo not email any of the pymongo developers directly with issues or\nquestions - you're more likely to get an answer on `stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb>`_\n(using a \"mongodb\" tag).\n\nbugs / feature requests\n=======================\n\nthink you\u2019ve found a bug? want to see a new feature in pymongo? please open a\ncase in our issue management tool, jira:\n\n- `create an account and login <https://jira.mongodb.org>`_.\n- navigate to `the python project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/python>`_.\n- click **create issue** - please provide as much information as possible about the issue type and how to reproduce it.\n\nbug reports in jira for all driver projects (i.e. python, csharp, java) and the\ncore server (i.e. server) project are **public**.\n\nhow to ask for help\n-------------------\n\nplease include all of the following information when opening an issue:\n\n- detailed steps to reproduce the problem, including full traceback, if possible.\n- the exact python version used, with patch level::\n\n  $ python -c \"import sys; print(sys.version)\"\n\n- the exact version of pymongo used, with patch level::\n\n  $ python -c \"import pymongo; print(pymongo.version); print(pymongo.has_c())\"\n\n- the operating system and version (e.g. windows 7, osx 10.8, ...)\n- web framework or asynchronous network library used, if any, with version (e.g.\n  django 1.7, mod_wsgi 4.3.0, gevent 1.0.1, tornado 4.0.2, ...)\n\nsecurity vulnerabilities\n------------------------\n\nif you\u2019ve identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other\nmongodb project, please report it according to the `instructions here\n<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report/>`_.\n\ninstallation\n============\n\npymongo can be installed with `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::\n\n  $ python -m pip install pymongo\n\nor ``easy_install`` from\n`setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::\n\n  $ python -m easy_install pymongo\n\nyou can also download the project source and do::\n\n  $ pip install .\n\ndo **not** install the \"bson\" package from pypi. pymongo comes with its own\nbson package; doing \"easy_install bson\" installs a third-party package that\nis incompatible with pymongo.\n\ndependencies\n============\n\npymongo supports cpython 3.7+ and pypy3.7+.\n\nrequired dependencies:\n\nsupport for mongodb+srv:// uris requires `dnspython\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnspython>`_\n\noptional dependencies:\n\ngssapi authentication requires `pykerberos\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pykerberos>`_ on unix or `winkerberos\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/winkerberos>`_ on windows. the correct\ndependency can be installed automatically along with pymongo::\n\n  $ python -m pip install \"pymongo[gssapi]\"\n\nmongodb-aws authentication requires `pymongo-auth-aws\n<https://pypi.org/project/pymongo-auth-aws/>`_::\n\n  $ python -m pip install \"pymongo[aws]\"\n\nocsp (online certificate status protocol) requires `pyopenssl\n<https://pypi.org/project/pyopenssl/>`_, `requests\n<https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_, `service_identity\n<https://pypi.org/project/service_identity/>`_ and may\nrequire `certifi\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi>`_::\n\n  $ python -m pip install \"pymongo[ocsp]\"\n\nwire protocol compression with snappy requires `python-snappy\n<https://pypi.org/project/python-snappy>`_::\n\n  $ python -m pip install \"pymongo[snappy]\"\n\nwire protocol compression with zstandard requires `zstandard\n<https://pypi.org/project/zstandard>`_::\n\n  $ python -m pip install \"pymongo[zstd]\"\n\nclient-side field level encryption requires `pymongocrypt\n<https://pypi.org/project/pymongocrypt/>`_ and\n`pymongo-auth-aws <https://pypi.org/project/pymongo-auth-aws/>`_::\n\n  $ python -m pip install \"pymongo[encryption]\"\n\nyou can install all dependencies automatically with the following\ncommand::\n\n  $ python -m pip install \"pymongo[gssapi,aws,ocsp,snappy,zstd,encryption]\"\n\nadditional dependencies are:\n\n- (to generate documentation or run tests) tox_\n\nexamples\n========\nhere's a basic example (for more see the *examples* section of the docs):\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n  >>> import pymongo\n  >>> client = pymongo.mongoclient(\"localhost\", 27017)\n  >>> db = client.test\n  >>> db.name\n  'test'\n  >>> db.my_collection\n  collection(database(mongoclient('localhost', 27017), 'test'), 'my_collection')\n  >>> db.my_collection.insert_one({\"x\": 10}).inserted_id\n  objectid('4aba15ebe23f6b53b0000000')\n  >>> db.my_collection.insert_one({\"x\": 8}).inserted_id\n  objectid('4aba160ee23f6b543e000000')\n  >>> db.my_collection.insert_one({\"x\": 11}).inserted_id\n  objectid('4aba160ee23f6b543e000002')\n  >>> db.my_collection.find_one()\n  {'x': 10, '_id': objectid('4aba15ebe23f6b53b0000000')}\n  >>> for item in db.my_collection.find():\n  ...     print(item[\"x\"])\n  ...\n  10\n  8\n  11\n  >>> db.my_collection.create_index(\"x\")\n  'x_1'\n  >>> for item in db.my_collection.find().sort(\"x\", pymongo.ascending):\n  ...     print(item[\"x\"])\n  ...\n  8\n  10\n  11\n  >>> [item[\"x\"] for item in db.my_collection.find().limit(2).skip(1)]\n  [8, 11]\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\ndocumentation is available at `pymongo.readthedocs.io <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.\n\ndocumentation can be generated by running **tox -m doc**. generated documentation can be found in the\n*doc/build/html/* directory.\n\nlearning resources\n==================\n\nmongodb learn - `python courses <https://learn.mongodb.com/catalog?labels=%5b%22language%22%5d&values=%5b%22python%22%5d>`_.\n`python articles on developer center <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/python/>`_.\n\ntesting\n=======\n\nthe easiest way to run the tests is to run **tox -m test** in\nthe root of the distribution.\n\nto verify that pymongo works with gevent's monkey-patching::\n\n    $ python green_framework_test.py gevent\n\nor with eventlet's::\n\n    $ python green_framework_test.py eventlet\n\n.. _tox: https://tox.wiki/en/latest/index.html\n",
