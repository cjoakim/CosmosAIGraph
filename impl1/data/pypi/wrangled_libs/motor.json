want to see a new feature in motor? please open a\ncase in our issue management tool, jira:\n\n- `create an account and login <https://jira.mongodb.org>`_.\n- navigate to `the motor project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/motor>`_.\n- click **create issue** - please provide as much information as possible about the issue type and how to reproduce it.\n\nbug reports in jira for all driver projects (i.e. motor, csharp, java) and the\ncore server (i.e. server) project are **public**.\n\nhow to ask for help\n-------------------\n\nplease include all of the following information when opening an issue:\n\n- detailed steps to reproduce the problem, including full traceback, if possible.\n- the exact python version used, with patch level::\n\n  $ python -c \"import sys; print(sys.version)\"\n\n- the exact version of motor used, with patch level::\n\n  $ python -c \"import motor; print(motor.version)\"\n\n- the exact version of pymongo used, with patch level::\n\n  $ python -c \"import pymongo; print(pymongo.version); print(pymongo.has_c())\"\n\n- the exact tornado version, if you are using tornado::\n\n  $ python -c \"import tornado; print(tornado.version)\"\n\n- the operating system and version (e.g. redhat enterprise linux 6.4, osx 10.9.5, ...)\n\nsecurity vulnerabilities\n------------------------\n\nif you've identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other\nmongodb project, please report it according to the `instructions here\n<https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report>`_.\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nmotor can be installed with `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::\n\n  $ pip install motor\n\ndependencies\n============\n\nmotor works in all the environments officially supported by tornado or by\nasyncio. it requires:\n\n* unix (including macos) or windows.\n* pymongo_ >=4.1,<5\n* python 3.7+\n\noptional dependencies:\n\nmotor supports same optional dependencies as pymongo. required dependencies can be installed\nalong with motor.\n\ngssapi authentication requires ``gssapi`` extra dependency. the correct\ndependency can be installed automatically along with motor::\n\n  $ pip install \"motor[gssapi]\"\n\nsimilarly,\n\nmongodb-aws authentication requires ``aws`` extra dependency::\n\n  $ pip install \"motor[aws]\"\n\nsupport for mongodb+srv:// uris requires ``srv`` extra dependency::\n\n  $ pip install \"motor[srv]\"\n\nocsp requires ``ocsp`` extra dependency::\n\n  $ pip install \"motor[ocsp]\"\n\nwire protocol compression with snappy requires ``snappy`` extra dependency::\n\n  $ pip install \"motor[snappy]\"\n\nwire protocol compression with zstandard requires ``zstd`` extra dependency::\n\n  $ pip install \"motor[zstd]\"\n\nclient-side field level encryption requires ``encryption`` extra dependency::\n\n  $ pip install \"motor[encryption]\"\n\nyou can install all dependencies automatically with the following\ncommand::\n\n  $ pip install \"motor[gssapi,aws,ocsp,snappy,srv,zstd,encryption]\"\n\nsee `requirements <https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/requirements.html>`_\nfor details about compatibility.\n\nexamples\n========\n\nsee the `examples on readthedocs <https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/index.html>`_.\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\nmotor's documentation is on readthedocs_.\n\nbuild the documentation with python 3.7+. install sphinx_, tornado_, and aiohttp_,\nand do ``cd doc; make html``.\n\nlearning resources\n==================\n\nmongodb learn - `python courses <https://learn.mongodb.com/catalog?labels=%5b%22language%22%5d&values=%5b%22python%22%5d>`_.\n`python articles on developer center <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/python/>`_.\n\ntesting\n=======\n\nrun ``python setup.py test``.\ntests are located in the ``test/`` directory.\n\n.. _pymongo: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/\n\n.. _mongodb: http://mongodb.org/\n\n.. _tornado: http://tornadoweb.org/\n\n.. _asyncio: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html\n\n.. _aiohttp: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp\n\n.. _readthedocs: https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n\n.. _sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/\n",
