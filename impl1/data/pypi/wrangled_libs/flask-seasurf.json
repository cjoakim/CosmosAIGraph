  "description": "[![tests](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/maxcountryman/flask-seasurf/tests/main?label=tests)](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-seasurf/actions)\n[![version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/flask-seasurf.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-seasurf)\n[![supported python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/flask-seasurf.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-seasurf)\n\n# flask-seasurf\n\nseasurf is a flask extension for preventing cross-site request forgery (csrf).\n\ncsrf vulnerabilities have been found in large and popular sites such as\nyoutube. these attacks are problematic because the mechanism they use is\nrelatively easy to exploit. this extension attempts to aid you in securing\nyour application from such attacks.\n\nthis extension is based on the excellent django middleware.\n\n\n## installation\n\ninstall the extension with one of the following commands:\n\n    $ easy_install flask-seasurf\n\nor alternatively if you have pip installed:\n\n    $ pip install flask-seasurf\n\n\n## usage\n\nusing seasurf is fairly straightforward. begin by importing the extension and\nthen passing your application object back to the extension, like this:\n\n    from flask_seasurf import seasurf\n    csrf = seasurf(app)\n\n\n## documentation\n\nthe sphinx-compiled documentation is available here: https://flask-seasurf.readthedocs.io/\n\n\n",
