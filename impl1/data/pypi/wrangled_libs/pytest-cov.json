fork or run stuff in a subprocess and will get covered without any fuss.\n* xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist's features and still get coverage.\n* consistent pytest behavior. if you run ``coverage run -m pytest`` you will have slightly different ``sys.path`` (cwd will be\n  in it, unlike when running ``pytest``).\n\nall features offered by the coverage package should work, either through pytest-cov's command line options or\nthrough coverage's config file.\n\n* free software: mit license\n\ninstallation\n============\n\ninstall with pip::\n\n    pip install pytest-cov\n\nfor distributed testing support install pytest-xdist::\n\n    pip install pytest-xdist\n\nupgrading from ancient pytest-cov\n---------------------------------\n\n`pytest-cov 2.0` is using a new ``.pth`` file (``pytest-cov.pth``). you may want to manually remove the older\n``init_cov_core.pth`` from site-packages as it's not automatically removed.\n\nuninstalling\n------------\n\nuninstall with pip::\n\n    pip uninstall pytest-cov\n\nunder certain scenarios a stray ``.pth`` file may be left around in site-packages.\n\n* `pytest-cov 2.0` may leave a ``pytest-cov.pth`` if you installed without wheels\n  (``easy_install``, ``setup.py install`` etc).\n* `pytest-cov 1.8 or older` will leave a ``init_cov_core.pth``.\n\nusage\n=====\n\n::\n\n    pytest --cov=myproj tests/\n\nwould produce a report like::\n\n    -------------------- coverage: ... ---------------------\n    name                 stmts   miss  cover\n    ----------------------------------------\n    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%\n    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%\n    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%\n    ----------------------------------------\n    total                  353     20    94%\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\n    http://pytest-cov.rtfd.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoverage data file\n==================\n\nthe data file is erased at the beginning of testing to ensure clean data for each test run. if you\nneed to combine the coverage of several test runs you can use the ``--cov-append`` option to append\nthis coverage data to coverage data from previous test runs.\n\nthe data file is left at the end of testing so that it is possible to use normal coverage tools to\nexamine it.\n\nlimitations\n===========\n\nfor distributed testing the workers must have the pytest-cov package installed.  this is needed since\nthe plugin must be registered through setuptools for pytest to start the plugin on the\nworker.\n\nfor subprocess measurement environment variables must make it from the main process to the\nsubprocess.  the python used by the subprocess must have pytest-cov installed.  the subprocess must\ndo normal site initialisation so that the environment variables can be detected and coverage\nstarted.\n\n\nacknowledgements\n================\n\nwhilst this plugin has been built fresh from the ground up it has been influenced by the work done\non pytest-coverage (ross lawley, james mills, holger krekel) and nose-cover (jason pellerin) which are\nother coverage plugins.\n\nned batchelder for coverage and its ability to combine the coverage results of parallel runs.\n\nholger krekel for pytest with its distributed testing support.\n\njason pellerin for nose.\n\nmichael foord for unittest2.\n\nno doubt others have contributed to these tools as well.\n\nchangelog\n=========\n\n4.1.0 (2023-05-24)\n------------------\n\n* updated ci with new pythons and dependencies.\n* removed rsyncdir support. this makes pytest-cov compatible with xdist 3.0.\n  contributed by sorin sbarnea in `#558 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/558>`_.\n* optimized summary generation to not be performed if no reporting is active (for example,\n  when ``--cov-report=''`` is used without ``--cov-fail-under``).\n  contributed by jonathan stewmon in `#589 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/589>`_.\n* added support for json reporting.\n  contributed by matthew gamble in `#582 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/582>`_.\n* refactored code to use f-strings.\n  contributed by mark mayo in `#572 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/572>`_.\n* fixed a skip in the test suite for some old xdist.\n  contributed by a bunch of people in `#565 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/565>`_.\n\n\n4.0.0 (2022-09-28)\n------------------\n\n**note that this release drops support for multiprocessing.**\n\n\n* `--cov-fail-under` no longer causes `pytest --collect-only` to fail\n  contributed by zac hatfield-dodds in `#511 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/511>`_.\n* dropped support for multiprocessing (mostly because `issue 82408 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82408>`_). this feature was\n  mostly working but very broken in certain scenarios and made the test suite very flaky and slow.\n\n  there is builtin multiprocessing support in coverage and you can migrate to that. all you need is this in your\n  ``.coveragerc``::\n\n    [run]\n    concurrency = multiprocessing\n    parallel = true\n    sigterm = true\n* fixed deprecation in ``setup.py`` by trying to import setuptools before distutils.\n  contributed by ben greiner in `#545 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/545>`_.\n*

output format via `--cov-report=lcov`. only works with coverage 6.3+.\n  contributed by christian fetzer in `#536 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/536>`_.\n* modernized pytest hook implementation.\n  contributed by bruno oliveira in `#549 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/549>`_\n  and ronny pfannschmidt in `#550 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/550>`_.\n\n\n3.0.0 (2021-10-04)\n-------------------\n\n**note that this release drops support for python 2.7 and python 3.5.**\n\n* added support for python 3.10 and updated various test dependencies.\n  contributed by hugo van kemenade in\n  `#500 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/500>`_.\n* switched from travis ci to github actions. contributed by hugo van kemenade in\n  `#494 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/494>`_ and\n  `#495 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/495>`_.\n* add a ``--cov-reset`` cli option.\n  contributed by danilo \u0161egan in\n  `#459 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/459>`_.\n* improved validation of ``--cov-fail-under`` cli option.\n  contributed by ... ronny pfannschmidt's desire for skark in\n  `#480 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/480>`_.\n* dropped python 2.7 support.\n  contributed by thomas grainger in\n  `#488

change for `toml` requirement.\n  contributed by thomas grainger in\n  `#477 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/477>`_.\n\n2.12.1 (2021-06-01)\n-------------------\n\n* changed the `toml` requirement to be always be directly required (instead of being required through a coverage extra).\n  this fixes issues with pip-compile (`pip-tools#1300 <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1300>`_).\n  contributed by sorin sbarnea in `#472 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/472>`_.\n* documented ``show_contexts``.\n  contributed

this prevents reporting issues.\n  contributed by mateus berardo de souza terra in `#433 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/433>`_.\n* improved sample projects (from the `examples <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/tree/master/examples>`_\n  directory) to support running `tox -e pyxy`. now the example configures a suffixed coverage data file,\n  and that makes the cleanup environment unnecessary.\n  contributed by ganden schaffner in `#435 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/435>`_.\n* removed the empty `console_scripts` entrypoint that confused some gentoo build script.\n  i didn't ask why it was so broken cause i didn't want to ruin my day.\n  contributed by micha\u0142 g\u00f3rny in `#434

attribute startswith`` failure that occurred when using the ``pytester`` plugin\n  in inline mode.\n\n2.10.0 (2020-06-12)\n-------------------\n\n* improved the ``--no-cov`` warning. now it's only shown if ``--no-cov`` is present before ``--cov``.\n* removed legacy pytest support. changed ``setup.py`` so that ``pytest>=4.6`` is required.\n\n2.9.0 (2020-05-22)\n------------------\n\n* fixed ``removedinpytest4warning`` when using pytest 3.10.\n  contributed by michael manganiello in `#354 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/354>`_.\n* made pytest startup faster when plugin not

always enable ``data_suffix`` (a coverage setting).\n  contributed by harm geerts in\n  `#387 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/387>`_.\n* changed ``--cov-append`` to handle loading previous data better\n  (fixes various path aliasing issues).\n* various other testing improvements, github issue templates, example updates.\n* fixed internal failures that are caused by tests that change the current working directory by\n  ensuring a consistent working directory when coverage is called.\n  see `#306 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/306>`_ and\n  `coveragepy#881 <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/881>`_\n\n2.8.1 (2019-10-05)\n------------------\n\n* fixed `#348 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348>`_ -\n  regression when only certain

disable coverage measurements. contributed by zoltan kozma in\n  `pr#135 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/135>`_.\n\n  **warning: do not put this in your configuration files, it's meant to be an one-off for situations where you want to\n  disable coverage from command line.**\n* fixed broken exception handling on ``.pth`` file. see `#136 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/136>`_.\n\n2.3.1 (2016-08-07)\n------------------\n\n* fixed regression causing spurious errors when xdist was used. see `#124\n  <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/124>`_.\n* fixed deprecationwarning about incorrect `addoption` use. contributed by florian bruhin in `pr#127\n  <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/127>`_.\n* fixed deprecated use of funcarg fixture api. contributed by daniel hahler in `pr#125\n  <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/125>`_.\n\n2.3.0 (2016-07-05)\n------------------\n\n* add support for specifying output location for html, xml, and annotate report.\n  contributed by patrick lannigan in `pr#113 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/113>`_.\n* fix bug hiding test failure when cov-fail-under failed.\n* for coverage >= 4.0, match the default behaviour of `coverage report` and\n  error if coverage fails to find the source instead of just printing a warning.\n  contributed by david szotten in `pr#116 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/116>`_.\n* fixed bug occurred when bare ``--cov`` parameter was used with xdist.\n  contributed by michael elovskikh in `pr#120 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/120>`_.\n* add support for ``skip_covered`` and added ``--cov-report=term-skip-covered`` command\n  line options. contributed by saurabh kumar in `pr#115 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/115>`_.\n\n2.2.1 (2016-01-30)\n------------------\n\n* fixed incorrect merging of coverage data when xdist was used and coverage was ``>= 4.0``.\n\n2.2.0 (2015-10-04)\n------------------\n\n* added support for changing working directory in tests. previously changing working\n  directory would disable coverage measurements in suprocesses.\n* fixed broken handling for ``--cov-report=annotate``.\n\n2.1.0 (2015-08-23)\n------------------\n\n* added support for `coverage 4.0b2`.\n* added the ``--cov-append`` command line options. contributed by christian ledermann\n  in `pr#80 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/80>`_.\n\n2.0.0 (2015-07-28)\n------------------\n\n* added ``--cov-fail-under``, akin to the new ``fail_under`` option in `coverage-4.0`\n  (automatically activated if there's a ``[report] fail_under = ...`` in ``.coveragerc``).\n* changed ``--cov-report=term`` to automatically upgrade to ``--cov-report=term-missing``\n  if there's ``[run] show_missing = true`` in ``.coveragerc``.\n* changed ``--cov`` so it can be used with no path argument (in which case the source\n  settings from ``.coveragerc`` will be used instead).\n* fixed `.pth` installation to work in all cases (install, easy_install, wheels, develop etc).\n* fixed `.pth` uninstallation to work for wheel installs.\n* support for coverage 4.0.\n* data file suffixing changed to use coverage's ``data_suffix=true`` option (instead of the\n  custom suffixing).\n* avoid warning about missing coverage data (just like ``coverage.control.process_startup``).\n* fixed a race condition when running with xdist (all the workers tried to combine the files).\n  it's possible that this issue is not present in `pytest-cov 1.8.x`.\n\n1.8.2 (2014-11-06)\n------------------\n\n* n/a\n",
