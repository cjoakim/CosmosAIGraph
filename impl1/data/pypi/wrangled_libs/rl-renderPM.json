  "description": "``rl_renderpm`` is a package containing the reportlab accelerator module\n\n``_renderpm``\n\nwhich can be used to speedup the ``reportlab.graphics.renderpm`` functions.\n\nthe python bitmap render module ``reportlab.graphics.renderpm`` can either use ``rlpycairo``, ``pycairo`` and ``freetype-py``\nor ``rl_renderpm`` + built in ``freetype`` libraries.\n\nthe choice is made by overriding the ``reportlab.rl_settings`` module value ``_renderpmbackend``\nusing one of the settings files ``reportlab/local_reportlab_settings.py``, ``reportlab_settings.py`` or  ``~/.reportlab_settings``, which are searched for in that order.\n\nthe default value of ``renderpmbackend`` is ``'rlpycairo'``, but it can be set to ``'_renderpm'`` to use this extension\nwhich is based on an older library ``libart_lgpl``. \n",
