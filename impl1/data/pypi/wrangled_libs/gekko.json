  "description": "gekko\n=====\n\ngekko is a python package for machine learning and optimization, specializing in\ndynamic optimization of differential algebraic equations (dae) systems. it is coupled \nwith large-scale solvers apopt and ipopt for linear, quadratic, nonlinear, and mixed integer \nprogramming. capabilities include machine learning, discrete or continuous state space\nmodels, simulation, estimation, and control.\n\ngekko models consist of equations and variables that create a symbolic representation of the\nproblem for a single data point or single time instance. solution modes then create the full model\nover all data points or time horizon. gekko supports a wide range of problem types, including:\n\n- linear programming (lp)\n- quadratic programming (qp)\n- nonlinear programming (nlp)\n- mixed-integer linear programming (milp)\n- mixed-integer quadratic programming (miqp)\n- mixed-integer nonlinear programming (minlp)\n- differential algebraic equations (daes)\n- mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (mpccs)\n- data regression / machine learning\n- moving horizon estimation (mhe)\n- model predictive control (mpc)\n- real-time optimization (rto)\n- sequential or simultaneous dae solution\n\ngekko compiles the model into byte-code and provides sparse derivatives to the solver with\nautomatic differentiation. gekko includes data cleansing functions and standard tag actions for industrially \nhardened control and optimization on windows, linux, macos, arm processors, or any other platform that \nruns python. options are available for local, edge, and cloud solutions to manage memory or compute \nresources.\n\n- [gekko homepage](https://machinelearning.byu.edu)\n- [gekko documentation](https://gekko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- [gekko examples](https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/main/gekkopythonoptimization)\n- [get gekko help on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gekko)\n\n\n\n",
