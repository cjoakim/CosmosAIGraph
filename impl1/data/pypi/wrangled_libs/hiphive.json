  "description": "hiphive\n=======\n\n**hiphive** is a tool for efficiently extracting high-order force constants from atomistic simulations, most commonly density functional theory calculations.\na detailed description of the functionality provided as well as an extensive tutorial can be found in the `user guide <https://hiphive.materialsmodeling.org/>`_.\ncomplete examples of using **hiphive** for force constants extraction can be found in the `hiphive-examples repository <https://gitlab.com/materials-modeling/hiphive-examples/>`_.\n\n**hiphive** is written in python, which allows easy integration with countless first-principles codes and analysis tools accessible in python, and allows for a simple and intuitive user interface.\nfor example using the following snippet one can train a force constant potential:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   cs = clusterspace(primitive_cell, cutoffs)\n   sc = structurecontainer(cs, list_of_training_structure)\n   opt = optimizer(sc.get_fit_data())\n   opt.train()\n   fcp = forceconstantpotential(cs, opt.parameters)\n\nafter which it can be used in various ways, e.g., for generating phonon dispersions, computing phonon lifetimes, or running molecular dynamics simulations.\n\nfor questions and help please use the `hiphive discussion forum on matsci.org <https://matsci.org/hiphive>`_.\n**hiphive** and its development are hosted on `gitlab <https://gitlab.com/materials-modeling/hiphive>`_.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\n**hiphive** can be installed via `pip`::\n\n    pip3 install hiphive\n\nor via `conda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hiphive>`_::\n\n    conda install -c conda-forge hiphive\n\n**hiphive** requires python3 and invokes functionality from several external libraries including the\n`atomic simulation environment <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_,\n`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_,\n`spglib <https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_,\n`sympy <http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_, and\n`trainstation <https://trainstation.materialsmodeling.org/>`_.\nplease consult the `installation section of the user guide <https://hiphive.materialsmodeling.org/installation.html>`_ for details.\n\n\ncredits\n-------\n\n**hiphive** has been developed at the `department of physics <https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/physics/pages/default.aspx>`_ of `chalmers university of technology <https://www.chalmers.se/>`_ (gothenburg, sweden) in the `condensed matter and materials theory division <http://www.materialsmodeling.org>`_.\n\nwhen using **hiphive** in your research please cite the following paper:\n\n| fredrik eriksson, erik fransson, and paul erhart\n| *the hiphive package for the extraction of high\u2010order force constants by machine learning*\n| adv. theory. sim., 1800184 (2019)\n| `doi: 10.1002/adts.201800184 <https://doi.org/10.1002/adts.201800184>`_\n\nplease consult the `credits <https://hiphive.materialsmodeling.org/credits>`_ page of the documentation for additional references.",
