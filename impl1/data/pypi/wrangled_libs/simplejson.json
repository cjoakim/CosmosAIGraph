  "description": "simplejson\n----------\n\nsimplejson is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible\njson <http://json.org> encoder and decoder for python 3.3+\nwith legacy support for python 2.5+.  it is pure python code\nwith no dependencies, but includes an optional c extension\nfor a serious speed boost.\n\nthe latest documentation for simplejson can be read online here:\nhttps://simplejson.readthedocs.io/\n\nsimplejson is the externally maintained development version of the\njson library included with python (since 2.6). this version is tested\nwith the latest python 3.8 and maintains backwards compatibility\nwith python 3.3+ and the legacy python 2.5 - python 2.7 releases.\n\nthe encoder can be specialized to provide serialization in any kind of\nsituation, without any special support by the objects to be serialized\n(somewhat like pickle). this is best done with the ``default`` kwarg\nto dumps.\n\nthe decoder can handle incoming json strings of any specified encoding\n(utf-8 by default). it can also be specialized to post-process json\nobjects with the ``object_hook`` or ``object_pairs_hook`` kwargs. this\nis particularly useful for implementing protocols such as json-rpc\nthat have a richer type system than json itself.\n\nfor those of you that have legacy systems to maintain, there is a\nvery old fork of simplejson in the `python2.2`_ branch that supports\npython 2.2. this is based on a very old version of simplejson,\nis not maintained, and should only be used as a last resort.\n\n.. _python2.2: https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/tree/python2.2\n\n\n",
