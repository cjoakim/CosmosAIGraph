(pip is typically bundled with python [installations](https://python.org/downloads).)\n\nto install from pypi with pip:\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install pytube\n```\n\nsometimes, the pypi release becomes slightly outdated. to install from the source with pip:\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/pytube/pytube\n```\n\n### using pytube in a python script\n\nto download a video using the library in a script, you'll need to import the youtube class from the library and pass an argument of the video url. from there, you can access the streams and download them.\n\n```python\n >>> from pytube import youtube\n >>> youtube('https://youtu.be/2lae1cqcoxo').streams.first().download()\n >>> yt = youtube('http://youtube.com/watch?v=2lae1cqcoxo')\n >>> yt.streams\n  ... .filter(progressive=true, file_extension='mp4')\n  ... .order_by('resolution')\n  ... .desc()\n  ... .first()\n  ... .download()\n```\n\n### using the command-line interface\n\nusing the cli is remarkably straightforward as well. to download a video at the highest progressive quality, you can use the following command:\n```bash\n$ pytube https://youtube.com/watch?v=2lae1cqcoxo\n```\n\nyou can also do the same for a playlist:\n```bash\n$ pytube https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pls1qulwo1riajecmeut4lfwj-ghgosh6n\n```\n\n\n",
