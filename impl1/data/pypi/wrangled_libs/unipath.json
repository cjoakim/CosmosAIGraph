  "description": "unipath is an object-oriented front end to the file/directory functions\r\nscattered throughout several python library modules.  it's based on jason\r\norendorff's *path.py* but has a friendlier api and higher-level features.\r\nunipath is stable, well-tested, and has been used in production since 2008.\r\nit runs on python 2.6+ and 3.3+.\r\n\r\n**version 1.1** is a bugfix release. most notably it fixes a unicode\r\nincompatibility on python 3 under windows (or operating systems with native\r\nunicpde filenames). the license is changed to mit (from the python license).",
