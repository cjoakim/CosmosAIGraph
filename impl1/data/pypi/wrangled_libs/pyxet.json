  "description": "pyxet is a python library that provides a pythonic interface for\n[xethub](https://xethub.com/).  xethub is simple git-based system capable of\nstoring tbs of ml data and models in a single repository, with block-level\ndata deduplication that enables hundreds of versions of similar data to be\nstored without requiring much storage.\n\nthe pyxet library has 3 components:\n\n1. a [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io)\ninterface that allows compatible libraries such as pandas, polars and duckdb\nto directly access any version of any file in a xet repository. see below\nfor some examples.\n\n2. a command line interface inspired by awscli that allows files to be\nuploaded to and downloaded from xet repository conveniently and efficiently.\n\n3. a file system mount mechanism that allows any version of any xet repository\nto be mounted. this works on mac, linux, and windows 11 pro.\n\nfor api documentation and full examples, please see [here](https://pyxet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n",
