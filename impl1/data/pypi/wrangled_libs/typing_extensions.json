  "description": "# typing extensions\n\n[![chat at https://gitter.im/python/typing](https://badges.gitter.im/python/typing.svg)](https://gitter.im/python/typing)\n\n[documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) \u2013\n[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/)\n\n## overview\n\nthe `typing_extensions` module serves two related purposes:\n\n- enable use of new type system features on older python versions. for example,\n  `typing.typeguard` is new in python 3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows\n  users on previous python versions to use it too.\n- enable experimentation with new type system peps before they are accepted and\n  added to the `typing` module.\n\n`typing_extensions` is treated specially by static type checkers such as\nmypy and pyright. objects defined in `typing_extensions` are treated the same\nway as equivalent forms in `typing`.\n\n`typing_extensions` uses\n[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). the\nmajor version will be incremented only for backwards-incompatible changes.\ntherefore, it's safe to depend\non `typing_extensions` like this: `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`,\nwhere `x.y` is the first version that includes all features you need.\n\n## included items\n\nsee [the documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for a\ncomplete listing of module contents.\n\n## contributing\n\nsee [contributing.md](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/contributing.md)\nfor how to contribute to `typing_extensions`.\n\n",
