  "description": "lxml is a pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  it\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the elementtree\napi.\n\nit extends the elementtree api significantly to offer support for xpath,\nrelaxng, xml schema, xslt, c14n and much more.\n\nto contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<https://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nin case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,\nyou can get it from the github repository at\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml .  note that this requires cython to\nbuild the sources, see the build instructions on the project home\npage.  to the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will\ninstall lxml from\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have\nan appropriate version of cython installed.\n\n\nafter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become\navailable at\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-4.9 .\nrunning ``easy_install lxml==4.9bugfix`` will install\nthe unreleased branch state from\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-4.9#egg=lxml-4.9bugfix\nas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  note that this\nrequires cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.\n\n4.9.4 (2023-12-19)\n==================\n\nbugs fixed\n----------\n\n* lp#2046398: inserting/replacing an ancestor into a node's children could loop indefinitely.\n\n* lp#1980767, gh#379: ``treebuilder.close()`` could fail with a ``typeerror`` after\n  parsing incorrect input.  original patch by enrico minack.\n\n* lp#1522052: a file-system specific test is now optional and should no longer fail\n  on systems that don't support it.\n\nother changes\n-------------\n\n* wheels include zlib 1.3, libxml2 2.10.3 and libxslt 1.1.39\n  (zlib 1.2.12, libxml2 2.10.3 and libxslt 1.1.37 on windows).\n\n* built with cython 0.29.37.\n\n\n\n\n",
