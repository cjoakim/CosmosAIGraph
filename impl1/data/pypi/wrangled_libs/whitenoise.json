(especially\nuseful on heroku, openshift and other paas providers.)\n\nit's designed to work nicely with a cdn for high-traffic sites so you don't have to\nsacrifice performance to benefit from simplicity.\n\nwhitenoise works with any wsgi-compatible app but has some special auto-configuration\nfeatures for django.\n\nwhitenoise takes care of best-practices for you, for instance:\n\n* serving compressed content (gzip and brotli formats, handling accept-encoding\n  and vary headers correctly)\n* setting far-future cache headers on content which won't change\n\nworried that serving static files with python is horribly inefficient?\nstill think you should be using amazon s3? have a look at the `infrequently\nasked questions`_.\n\nto get started, see the documentation_.\n\n.. _infrequently asked questions: https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#infrequently-asked-questions\n.. _documentation: https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n",
