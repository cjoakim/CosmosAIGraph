https://github.com/brechtm/citeproc-py/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/brechtm/citeproc-py/actions/workflows/test.yml\n   :alt: build status\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/brechtm/citeproc-py/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/brechtm/citeproc-py?branch=master\n   :alt: code coverage\n\nciteproc-py is a `csl`_ processor for python. it aims to implement the\n`csl 1.0.1 specification`_. citeproc-py can output styled citations and\nbibliographies in a number of different output formats. currently\nsupported are plain text, restructuredtext and html. other formats can\nbe added easily.\n\nciteproc-py uses `semantic versioning`_. currently, its major version\nnumber is still at 0, meaning the api is not yet stable. however, you\nshould not expect to see any major api changes soon.\n\n.. _csl: http://citationstyles.org/\n.. _csl 1.0.1 specification: https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/1.0.1/specification.html\n.. _semantic versioning: http://semver.org/\n\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\nciteproc-py supports python 3.6 and up. it depends on `lxml`_ for parsing and\nnavigating the csl style and locale files.\n\n.. _lxml: http://lxml.de/\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nthe recommended way of installing citeproc-py is by using `pip`_::\n\n   pip install citeproc-py\n\nif lxml isn't installed, pip will try to install it for you.\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/\n\nif you insist, you can manually install citeproc-py from distribution packages\nhosted at `pypi`_. please ignore the release archives offered by github.\n\n.. _pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citeproc-py/\n\n\ngetting started\n---------------\n\nto get started with citeproc-py, take a look at the examples under\n``examples/``. two examples are provided, one parsing references from a\njson representation of references as supported by citeproc-js, another\nparsing the references from a bibtex file. both show and explain how to\ncite references and render the bibliography.\n\n\ncsl compatibility\n-----------------\n\ncurrently, citeproc-py passes almost 60% of the (relevant) tests in the\n`citeproc-test suite`_. however, it is more than 60% complete, as\nciteproc-py doesn't take care of double spaces and repeated punctuation\nmarks yet, making a good deal of the tests fail. in addition, the\nfollowing features have not yet been implemented (there are probably\nsome i forgot though):\n\n-  disambiguation/year-suffix\n-  et-al-subsequent-min/et-al-subsequent-use-first\n-  collapsing\n-  punctuation-in-quote\n-  display\n\nalso, some `citeproc-js`_ functionality that is not part of the csl spec\nis not (yet) supported:\n\n-  raw dates\n-  static-ordering\n-  literal names\n\n.. _citeproc-test suite: https://github.com/citation-style-language/test-suite\n.. _citeproc-js: https://github.com/juris-m/citeproc-js\n\n\nrunning the tests\n-----------------\n\nfirst clone the `citeproc-test suite`_ so that it sits next to the\nciteproc-py directory. now you can run ``citeproc-test.py`` (in the ``tests``\ndirectory). run ``citeproc-test.py --help`` to see its usage information.\n\n\nchangelog\n---------\n\nrelease 0.6.0
