  "description": "requests kerberos/gssapi authentication library\n===============================================\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos/actions/workflows/ci.yml\n\nrequests is an http library, written in python, for human beings. this library\nadds optional kerberos/gssapi authentication support and supports mutual\nauthentication. basic get usage:\n\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import requests\n    >>> from requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth\n    >>> r = requests.get(\"http://example.org\", auth=httpkerberosauth())\n    ...\n\nthe entire ``requests.api`` should be supported.\n\nsetup\n-----\n\nin order to use this library, there must already be a kerberos ticket-granting\nticket(tgt) cached in a kerberos credential cache. whether a tgt is available\ncan be easily determined by running the ``klist`` command. if no tgt is\navailable, then it first must be obtained by running the ``kinit`` command, or\npointing the $krb5ccname to a credential cache with a valid tgt.\n\nin short, the library will handle the \"negotiations\" of kerberos authentication,\nbut ensuring that an initial tgt is available and valid is the responsibility\nof the user.\n\nauthentication failures\n-----------------------\n\nclient authentication failures will be communicated to the caller by returning\nthe 401 response. a 401 response may also come from an expired ticket-granting\nticket.\n\nmutual authentication\n---------------------\n\nrequired\n^^^^^^^^\n\nby default, ``httpkerberosauth`` will require mutual authentication from the\nserver, and if a server emits a non-error response which cannot be\nauthenticated, a ``requests_kerberos.errors.mutualauthenticationerror`` will\nbe raised. if a server emits an error which cannot be authenticated, it will\nbe returned to the user but with its contents and headers stripped. if the\nresponse content is more important than the need for mutual auth on errors,\n(eg, for certain winrm calls) the stripping behavior can be suppressed by\nsetting ``sanitize_mutual_error_response=false``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import requests\n    >>> from requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth, required\n    >>> kerberos_auth = httpkerberosauth(mutual_authentication=required, sanitize_mutual_error_response=false)\n    >>> r = requests.get(\"https://windows.example.org/wsman\", auth=kerberos_auth)\n    ...\n\n\noptional\n^^^^^^^^\n\nif you'd prefer to not require mutual authentication, you can set your\npreference when constructing your ``httpkerberosauth`` object:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import requests\n    >>> from requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth, optional\n    >>> kerberos_auth = httpkerberosauth(mutual_authentication=optional)\n    >>> r = requests.get(\"http://example.org\", auth=kerberos_auth)\n    ...\n\nthis will cause ``requests_kerberos`` to attempt mutual authentication if the\nserver advertises that it supports it, and cause a failure if authentication\nfails, but not if the server does not support it at all.\n\ndisabled\n^^^^^^^^\n\nwhile we don't recommend it, if you'd prefer to never attempt mutual\nauthentication, you can do that as well:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import requests\n    >>> from requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth, disabled\n    >>> kerberos_auth = httpkerberosauth(mutual_authentication=disabled)\n    >>> r = requests.get(\"http://example.org\", auth=kerberos_auth)\n    ...\n\npreemptive authentication\n-------------------------\n\n``httpkerberosauth`` can be forced to preemptively initiate the kerberos\ngss exchange and present a kerberos ticket on the initial request (and all\nsubsequent). by default, authentication only occurs after a\n``401 unauthorized`` response containing a kerberos or negotiate challenge\nis received from the origin server. this can cause mutual authentication\nfailures for hosts that use a persistent connection (eg, windows/winrm), as\nno kerberos challenges are sent after the initial auth handshake. this\nbehavior can be altered by setting  ``force_preemptive=true``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import requests\n    >>> from requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth, required\n    >>> kerberos_auth = httpkerberosauth(mutual_authentication=required, force_preemptive=true)\n    >>> r = requests.get(\"https://windows.example.org/wsman\", auth=kerberos_auth)\n    ...\n\nhostname override\n-----------------\n\nif communicating with a host whose dns name doesn't match its\nkerberos hostname (eg, behind a content switch or load balancer),\nthe hostname used for the kerberos gss exchange can be overridden by\nsetting the ``hostname_override`` arg:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import requests\n    >>> from requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth, required\n    >>> kerberos_auth = httpkerberosauth(hostname_override=\"internalhost.local\")\n    >>> r = requests.get(\"https://externalhost.example.org/\", auth=kerberos_auth)\n    ...\n\nexplicit principal\n------------------\n\n``httpkerberosauth`` normally uses the default principal (ie, the user for\nwhom you last ran ``kinit`` or ``kswitch``, or an sso credential if\napplicable). however, an explicit principal can be specified, which will\ncause kerberos to look for a matching credential cache for the named user.\nthis feature depends on os support for collection-type credential caches,\nas well as working principal support in pykerberos (it is broken in many\nbuilds). an explicit principal can be specified with the ``principal`` arg:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import requests\n    >>> from requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth, required\n    >>> kerberos_auth = httpkerberosauth(principal=\"user@realm\")\n    >>> r = requests.get(\"http://example.org\", auth=kerberos_auth)\n    ...\n\non windows, winkerberos is used instead of pykerberos. winkerberos allows the\nuse of arbitrary principals instead of a credential cache. passwords can be\nspecified by following the form ``user@realm:password`` for ``principal``.\n\ndelegation\n----------\n\n``requests_kerberos`` supports credential delegation (``gss_c_deleg_flag``).\nto enable delegation of credentials to a server that requests delegation, pass\n``delegate=true`` to ``httpkerberosauth``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import requests\n    >>> from requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth\n    >>> r = requests.get(\"http://example.org\", auth=httpkerberosauth(delegate=true))\n    ...\n\nbe careful to only allow delegation to servers you trust as they will be able\nto impersonate you using the delegated credentials.\n\nlogging\n-------\n\nthis library makes extensive use of python's logging facilities.\n\nlog messages are logged to the ``requests_kerberos`` and\n``requests_kerberos.kerberos_`` named loggers.\n\nif you are having difficulty we suggest you configure logging. issues with the\nunderlying kerberos libraries will be made apparent. additionally, copious debug\ninformation is made available which may assist in troubleshooting if you\nincrease your log level all the way up to debug.\n\n\nhistory\n=======\n\n0.14.0: 2021-12-05\n------------------\n\n- added support for proxy authentication with ``http`` endpoints.\n- support for proxying ``https`` endpoints is not available due to limitations\n  of the underlying requests/urllib3 library.\n- fixed up stray bytes to str conversion.\n\n0.13.0: 2021-11-03\n------------------\n\n- change kerberos dependencies to pyspnego_ to modernise the underlying\n  kerberos library that is used.\n- removed the ``wrap_winrm`` and ``unwrap_winrm`` functions\n- dropped support for python 2 and raised minimum python version to 3.6.\n- renamed the ``context`` attribute to ``_context`` to indicate it's meant for\n  internal use only.\n- fix negotiate header regex pattern to avoid dos affected patterns\n\n.. _pyspnego: https://github.com/jborean93/pyspnego\n\n0.12.0: 2017-12-20\n------------------------\n\n- add support for channel binding tokens (assumes pykerberos support >= 1.2.1)\n- add support for kerberos message encryption (assumes pykerberos support >= 1.2.1)\n- misc ci/test fixes\n\n0.11.0: 2016-11-02\n------------------\n\n- switch dependency on windows from kerberos-sspi/pywin32 to winkerberos.\n  this brings custom principal support to windows users.\n\n0.10.0: 2016-05-18\n------------------\n\n- make it possible to receive errors without having their contents and headers\n  stripped.\n- resolve a bug caused by passing the ``principal``

authentication support by adding kerberos-sspi as an\n  alternative backend.\n\n- prevent infinite recursion when a server returns 401 to an authorization\n  attempt.\n\n- reduce the logging during successful responses.\n\n0.6.1: 2014-11-14\n-----------------\n\n- fix httpkerberosauth not to treat non-file as a file\n\n- prevent infinite recursion when gsserrors occurs\n\n0.6: 2014-11-04\n---------------\n\n- handle mutual authentication (see pull request 36_)\n\n  all users should upgrade immediately. this has been reported to\n  oss-security_ and we are awaiting a proper cve identifier.\n\n  **update**: we were issued cve-2014-8650\n\n- distribute as a wheel.\n\n.. _36: https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos/pull/36\n.. _oss-security: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/\n\n0.5: 2014-05-14\n---------------\n\n- allow non-http service principals with httpkerberosauth using a new optional\n  argument ``service``.\n\n- fix bug in ``setup.py`` on distributions where the ``compiler`` module is\n  not available.\n\n- add test dependencies to ``setup.py`` so ``python setup.py test`` will work.\n\n0.4: 2013-10-26\n---------------\n\n- minor updates in the readme\n- change requirements to depend on requests above 1.1.0\n\n0.3: 2013-06-02\n---------------\n\n- work with servers operating on
