  "description": "# flake8-unused-arguments\n\na flake8 plugin that checks for unused function arguments.\n\nthis package adds the following warnings:\n\n - `u100` - an unused argument.\n - `u101` - an unused argument starting with an underscore\n\nconfiguration options also exist:\n - `unused-arguments-ignore-abstract-functions` - don't show warnings for abstract functions.\n - `unused-arguments-ignore-overload-functions` - don't show warnings for overload functions.\n - `unused-arguments-ignore-override-functions` - don't show warnings for overridden functions.\n - `unused-arguments-ignore-stub-functions` - don't show warnings for empty functions.\n - `unused-arguments-ignore-variadic-names` - don't show warnings for unused *args and **kwargs.\n - `unused-arguments-ignore-lambdas` - don't show warnings for all lambdas.\n - `unused-arguments-ignore-nested-functions` - don't show warnings for nested\n   functions. only show warnings for functions in the top level of a module, or methods\n   of a class in the top level of a module.\n - `unused-arguments-ignore-dunder` - don't show warnings for double-underscore methods.\n   these methods implement or override native builtin methods which have a specific\n   signature. therefore arguments must always be present. this is the case of methods\n   like `__new__`, `__init__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__reduce_ex__`,\n   `__enter__`, `__exit__`, etc.\n\n## changelog\n\n0.0.13\n - added a new option for ignoring functions decorated with the override decorator. thanks to thomas m kehrenberg for contributing this!\n\n0.0.12\n - fixed an issue causing flake8 --help to break. thanks to calum young for contributing this fix!\n - starting from this release, automated ci runs on each github pr. thanks again to calum young for contributing this work!\n\n0.0.11\n - added a new option for ignoring functions decorated with overload.\n - added a new option for ignoring dunder methods (double-underscore) methods.\n\n0.0.10\n - added new options for ignoring lambdas and nested functions. thanks to jo\u00e3o eiras for contributing these!\n\n0.0.9\n - check nested functions.\n - don't crash if an attribute is used in a raise statement.\n\n0.0.8\n - whoops, report the right version when using flake8 --help.\n\n0.0.7\n - the first unused argument in a @classmethod decorated function wasn't properly detected. thanks to sebastian dietrich for contributing the fix!\n\n0.0.6\n - stub functions that have docstrings are now correctly detected as stub functions\n - functions with only a docstring are considered stub functions\n\n0.0.5\n - the positions reported are now for the arguments themselves, rather than the function\n\n0.0.4\n - wrong project name in the readme, whoopsies\n\n0.0.3\n - treat functions that start with \"raise notimplementederror()\" as stub functions\n\n0.0.2\n - fixed error in packaging\n\n0.0.1\n - initial release\n",
