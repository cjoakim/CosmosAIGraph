  "description": "# dedupe python library\n\n[![tests passing](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/actions?query=workflow%3atests)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dedupeio/dedupe/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=aaukurtegh)](https://codecov.io/gh/dedupeio/dedupe)\n\n_dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform fuzzy matching, deduplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data._\n\n__dedupe__ will help you: \n\n* __remove duplicate entries__ from a spreadsheet of names and addresses\n* __link a list__ with customer information to another with order history, even without unique customer ids\n* take a database of campaign contributions and __figure out which ones were made by the same person__, even if the names were entered slightly differently for each record\n\ndedupe takes in human training data and comes up with the best rules for your dataset to quickly and automatically find similar records, even with very large databases.\n\n## important links\n* documentation: https://docs.dedupe.io/\n* repository: https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe\n* issues: https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/issues\n* mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-source-deduplication\n* examples: https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples\n\n## dedupe library consulting\n\nif you or your organization would like professional assistance in working with the dedupe library, dedupe.io llc offers consulting services. [read more about pricing and available services here](https://dedupe.io/pricing/#consulting).\n\n## tools built with dedupe\n\n### [dedupe.io](https://dedupe.io/)\na cloud service powered by the dedupe library for de-duplicating and finding matches in your data. it provides a step-by-step wizard for uploading your data, setting up a model, training, clustering and reviewing the results.\n\n[dedupe.io](https://dedupe.io/) also supports record linkage across data sources and continuous matching and training through an [api](https://apidocs.dedupe.io/en/latest/).\n\nfor more, see the [dedupe.io product site](https://dedupe.io/), [tutorials on how to use it](https://dedupe.io/tutorial/intro-to-dedupe-io.html), and [differences between it and the dedupe library](https://dedupe.io/documentation/should-i-use-dedupeio-or-the-dedupe-python-library.html).\n\ndedupe is well adopted by the python community. check out this [blogpost](https://medium.com/district-data-labs/basics-of-entity-resolution-with-python-and-dedupe-bc87440b64d4),\na youtube video on how to use [dedupe with python](https://youtu.be/mcstwxeurha) and a youtube video on how to apply [dedupe at scale using spark](https://youtu.be/q9hpuymiwje?t=2704).\n\n\n### [csvdedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/csvdedupe)\ncommand line tool for de-duplicating and [linking](https://github.com/dedupeio/csvdedupe#csvlink-usage) csv files. read about it on [source knight-mozilla opennews](https://source.opennews.org/en-us/articles/introducing-cvsdedupe/).\n\n## installation\n\n### using dedupe\n\nif you only want to use dedupe, install it this way:\n\n```bash\npip install dedupe\n```\n\nfamiliarize yourself with [dedupe's api](https://docs.dedupe.io/en/latest/api-documentation.html), and get started on your project. need inspiration? have a look at [some examples](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples).\n\n### developing dedupe\n\nwe recommend using [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html) and [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) for working in a virtualized development environment. [read how to set up virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).\n\nonce you have virtualenvwrapper set up,\n\n```bash\nmkvirtualenv dedupe\ngit clone https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe.git\ncd dedupe\npip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nif these tests pass, then everything should have been installed correctly!\n\n```bash\npytest\n```\n\nafterwards, whenever you want to work on dedupe,\n\n```bash\nworkon dedupe\n```\n\n## testing\nunit tests of core dedupe functions\n```bash\npytest\n```\n\n#### test using canonical dataset from bilenko's research\n  \nusing deduplication\n```bash\npython -m pip install -e ./benchmarks\npython benchmarks/benchmarks/canonical.py\n```\n\nusing record linkage\n```bash\npython -m pip install -e ./benchmarks\npython benchmarks/benchmarks/canonical_matching.py\n```\n\n\n## team\n\n* forest gregg, datamade\n* derek eder, datamade\n\n## credits\n\ndedupe is based on mikhail yuryevich bilenko's ph.d. dissertation: [*learnable similarity functions and their application to record linkage and clustering*](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/papers/marlin-dissertation-06.pdf).\n\n## errors / bugs\n\nif something is not behaving intuitively, it is a bug, and should be reported.\n[report it here](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/issues)\n\n\n## note on patches/pull requests\n \n* fork the project.\n* make your feature addition or bug fix.\n* send us a pull request. bonus points for topic branches.\n\n## copyright\n\ncopyright (c) 2022 forest gregg and derek eder. released under the [mit license](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/blob/main/license).\n\nthird-party copyright in this distribution is noted where applicable.\n\n## citing dedupe\nif you use dedupe in an academic work, please give this citation:\n\nforest gregg and derek eder. 2022. dedupe. https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe.\n",
