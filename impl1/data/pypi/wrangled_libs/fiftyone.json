hinders the success of machine learning systems more than poor quality\ndata. and without the right tools, improving a model can be time-consuming and\ninefficient.\n\n[fiftyone](https://fiftyone.ai) supercharges your machine learning workflows by\nenabling you to visualize datasets and interpret models faster and more\neffectively.\n\nuse fiftyone to get hands-on with your data, including visualizing complex\nlabels, evaluating your models, exploring scenarios of interest, identifying\nfailure modes, finding annotation mistakes, and much more!\n\nyou can get involved by joining our slack community, reading our blog on\nmedium, and following us on social media:\n\n[![slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-4a154b?logo=slack&logocolor=white)](https://slack.voxel51.com)\n[![medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium-12100e?logo=medium&logocolor=white)](https://medium.com/voxel51)\n[![twitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/twitter-1da1f2?logo=twitter&logocolor=white)](https://twitter.com/voxel51)\n[![linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-0077b5?logo=linkedin&logocolor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/voxel51)\n[![facebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/facebook-1877f2?logo=facebook&logocolor=white)](https://www.facebook.com/voxel51)\n\n## installation\n\nyou can install the latest stable version of fiftyone via `pip`:\n\n```shell\npip install fiftyone\n```\n\nconsult the\n[installation guide](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/getting_started/install.html)\nfor troubleshooting and other information about getting up-and-running with\nfiftyone.\n\n## quickstart\n\ndive right into fiftyone by opening a python shell and running the snippet\nbelow, which downloads a\n[small dataset](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#quickstart)\nand launches the\n[fiftyone app](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/app.html) so you\ncan explore it:\n\n```py\nimport fiftyone as fo\nimport fiftyone.zoo as foz\n\ndataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(\"quickstart\")\nsession = fo.launch_app(dataset)\n```\n\nthen check out\n[this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/voxel51/fiftyone-examples/blob/master/examples/quickstart.ipynb)\nto see some common workflows on the quickstart dataset.\n\nnote that if you are running the above code in a script, you must include\n`session.wait()` to block execution until you close the app. see\n[this page](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/app.html#creating-a-session)\nfor more information.\n\n## documentation\n\nfull documentation for fiftyone is available at\n[fiftyone.ai](https://fiftyone.ai). in particular, see these resources:\n\n-   [tutorials](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/tutorials/index.html)\n-   [recipes](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/recipes/index.html)\n-   [user guide](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/index.html)\n-   [cli documentation](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/cli/index.html)\n-   [api reference](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/api/fiftyone.html)\n\n## examples\n\ncheck out the [fiftyone-examples](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-examples)\nrepository for open source and community-contributed examples of using\nfiftyone.\n\n## contributing to fiftyone\n\nfiftyone is open source and community contributions are welcome!\n\ncheck out the\n[contribution guide](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/contributing.md)\nto learn how to get involved.\n\n## installing from source\n\nthe instructions below are for macos and linux systems. windows users may need\nto make adjustments. if you are working in google colab,\n[skip to here](#source-installs-in-google-colab).\n\n### prerequisites\n\nyou will need:\n\n-   [python](https://www.python.org) (3.7 or newer)\n-   [node.js](https://nodejs.org) - on linux, we recommend using\n    [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install an up-to-date version.\n-   [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - once node.js is installed, you can install\n    yarn via `npm install -g yarn`\n-   on linux, you will need at least the `openssl` and `libcurl` packages. on\n    debian-based distributions, you will need to install `libcurl4` or\n    `libcurl3` instead of `libcurl`, depending on the age of your distribution.\n    for example:\n\n```shell\n# ubuntu\nsudo apt install libcurl4 openssl\n\n# fedora\nsudo dnf install libcurl openssl\n```\n\n### installation\n\nwe strongly recommend that you install fiftyone in a\n[virtual environment](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/getting_started/virtualenv.html)\nto maintain a clean workspace. the install script is only supported in\nposix-based systems (e.g. mac and linux).\n\nfirst, clone the repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone\ncd fiftyone\n```\n\nthen run the install script:\n\n```shell\nbash install.bash\n```\n\n**note:** if you run into issues importing fiftyone, you may need to add the\npath to the cloned repository to your `pythonpath`:\n\n```shell\nexport pythonpath=$pythonpath:/path/to/fiftyone\n```\n\n**note:** the install script adds to your `nvm` settings in your `~/.bashrc` or\n`~/.bash_profile`, which is needed for installing and building the app\n\n**note:** when you pull in new changes to the app, you will need to rebuild it,\nwhich you can do either by rerunning the install script or just running\n`yarn build` in the `./app` directory.\n\n### upgrading your source installation\n\nto upgrade an existing source installation to the bleeding edge, simply pull\nthe latest `develop` branch and rerun the install script:\n\n```shell\ngit checkout develop\ngit pull\nbash install.bash\n```\n\n### developer installation\n\nif you would like to\n[contribute to fiftyone](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/contributing.md),\nyou should perform a developer installation using the `-d` flag of the install\nscript:\n\n```shell\nbash install.bash -d\n```\n\n### source installs in google colab\n\nyou can install from source in\n[google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by running the following in a\ncell and then **restarting the runtime**:\n\n```shell\n%%shell\n\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone.git\ncd fiftyone\nbash install.bash\n```\n\n### docker installs\n\nrefer to\n[these instructions](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/environments/index.html#docker)\nto see how to build and run docker images containing source or release builds\nof fiftyone.\n\n### ui development on storybook\n\nvoxel51 is currently in the process of implementing a\n[storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which contains examples of its basic ui\ncomponents. you can access the current storybook instances by running **yarn\nstorybook** in **/app/packages/components**. while the storybook instance is\nrunning, any changes to the component will trigger a refresh in the storybook\napp.\n\n```shell\n%%shell\n\ncd /app/packages/components\nyarn storybook\n```\n\n### generating documentation\n\nsee the\n[docs guide](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/docs/readme.md)\nfor information on building and contributing to the documentation.\n\n## uninstallation\n\nyou can uninstall fiftyone as follows:\n\n```shell\npip uninstall fiftyone fiftyone-brain fiftyone-db fiftyone-desktop\n```\n\n## contributors\n\nspecial thanks to these amazing people for contributing to fiftyone!
