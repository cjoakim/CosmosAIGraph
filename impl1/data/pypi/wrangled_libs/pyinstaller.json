  "description": "pyinstaller overview\n====================\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyinstaller\n   :alt: pypi\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyinstaller\n   :alt: pypi - python version\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/pyinstaller/stable\n   :alt: read the docs (version)\n   :target: https://pyinstaller.org\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/pyinstaller\n   :alt: pypi - downloads\n   :target: https://pypistats.org/packages/pyinstaller\n\n\npyinstaller bundles a python application and all its dependencies into a single\npackage. the user can run the packaged app without installing a python\ninterpreter or any modules.\n\n:documentation: https://pyinstaller.org/\n:code:          https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller\n\npyinstaller reads a python script written by you. it analyzes your code\nto discover every other module and library your script needs in order to\nexecute. then it collects copies of all those files -- including the active\npython interpreter! -- and puts them with your script in a single folder, or\noptionally in a single executable file.\n\n\npyinstaller is tested against windows, macos, and gnu/linux.\nhowever, it is not a cross-compiler:\nto make a windows app you run pyinstaller in windows; to make\na gnu/linux app you run it in gnu/linux, etc.\npyinstaller has been used successfully\nwith aix, solaris, freebsd and openbsd,\nbut is not tested against them as part of the continuous integration tests.\n\n\nmain advantages\n---------------\n\n- works out-of-the-box with any python version 3.8-3.12.\n- fully multi-platform, and uses the os support to load the dynamic libraries,\n  thus ensuring full compatibility.\n- correctly bundles the major python packages such as numpy, pyqt5,\n  pyside2, pyqt6, pyside6, wxpython, matplotlib and others out-of-the-box.\n- compatible with many 3rd-party packages out-of-the-box. (all the required\n  tricks to make external packages work are already integrated.)\n- works with code signing on macos.\n- bundles ms visual c++ dlls on windows.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\npyinstaller is available on pypi. you can install it through `pip`:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n      pip install pyinstaller\n\n\nrequirements and tested platforms\n---------------------------------\n\n- python:\n    - 3.8-3.12. note that python 3.10.0 contains a bug making it unsupportable by\n      pyinstaller. pyinstaller will also not work with beta releases of python\n      3.13.\n- windows (32bit/64bit/arm64):\n    - pyinstaller should work on windows 7 or newer, but we only officially support windows 8+.\n    - support for python installed from the windows store without using virtual\n      environments requires pyinstaller 4.4 or later.\n- linux:\n    - gnu libc based distributions on architectures ``x86_64``, ``aarch64``,\n      ``i686``, ``ppc64le``, ``s390x``.\n    - musl libc based distributions on architectures ``x86_64``, ``aarch64``.\n    - ldd: console application to print the shared libraries required\n      by each program or shared library. this typically can be found in\n      the distribution-package `glibc` or `libc-bin`.\n    - objdump: console application to display information from\n      object files. this typically can be found in the\n      distribution-package `binutils`.\n    - objcopy: console application to copy and translate object files.\n      this typically can be found in the distribution-package `binutils`,\n      too.\n    - raspberry pi users on ``armv5``-``armv7`` should `add piwheels as an extra\n      index url <https://www.piwheels.org/>`_ then ``pip install pyinstaller``\n      as usual.\n- macos (``x86_64`` or ``arm64``):\n    - macos 10.15 (catalina) or newer.\n    - supports building ``universal2`` applications provided that your installation\n      of python and all your dependencies are also compiled ``universal2``.\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nbasic usage is very simple, just run it against your main script:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n      pyinstaller /path/to/yourscript.py\n\nfor more details, see the `manual`_.\n\n\nuntested platforms\n------------------\n\nthe following platforms have been contributed and any feedback or\nenhancements on these are welcome.\n\n- freebsd\n    - ldd\n- solaris\n    - ldd\n    - objdump\n- aix\n    - aix 6.1 or newer. pyinstaller will not work with statically\n      linked python libraries.\n    - ldd\n- linux on any other libc implementation/architecture combination not listed\n  above.\n\nbefore using any contributed platform, you need to build the pyinstaller\nbootloader. this will happen automatically when you ``pip install\npyinstaller`` provided that you have an appropriate c compiler (typically\neither ``gcc`` or ``clang``) and zlib's development headers already installed.\n\n\nsupport\n-------\n\n- official debugging guide: https://pyinstaller.org/en/v6.3.0/when-things-go-wrong.html\n- assorted user contributed help topics: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki\n- web based q&a forums: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/discussions\n- email based q&a forums: https://groups.google.com/g/pyinstaller\n\n\nchanges in this release\n-----------------------\n\nyou can find a detailed list of changes in this release\nin the `changelog`_ section of the manual.\n\n.. _`manual`: https://pyinstaller.org/en/v6.3.0/\n.. _`changelog`: https://pyinstaller.org/en/v6.3.0/changes.html\n",
