python package\n\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-apache%202.0-green.svg)](https://github.com/fabsig/gpboost/blob/master/license)\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/gpboost.svg?logo=python&logocolor=white\">](https://pypi.org/project/gpboost)\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/gpboost.svg?logo=pypi&logocolor=white\">](https://pypi.org/project/gpboost)\n[<img src=\"https://static.pepy.tech/badge/gpboost\">](https://pepy.tech/project/gpboost)\n\nthis is the python package implementation of the gpboost library. see https://github.com/fabsig/gpboost for more information on the modeling background and the software implementation.\n\n### table of contents\n* [examples and documentation](#examples-and-documentation)\n* [installation](#installation)\n  * [installation from pypi](#installation-from-pypi-using-precompiled-binaries)\n  * [installation from source](#installation-from-source)\n\n\n## examples and documentation\n\n* [**python examples**](https://github.com/fabsig/gpboost/tree/master/examples/python-guide)\n  * [gpboost / lagaboost algorithm](https://github.com/fabsig/gpboost/tree/master/examples/python-guide/gpboost_algorithm.py) for gaussian (\"regression\") and non-gaussian likelihoods (e.g., \"classification\", etc.)\n  * [generalized linear gaussian process and mixed effects models](https://github.com/fabsig/gpboost/tree/master/examples/python-guide/generalized_linear_gaussian_process_mixed_effects_models.py)\n* the **documentation at [https://gpboost.readthedocs.io](https://gpboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_package.html)**\n\n## installation\n\n#### before you install\n\n* [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools) is needed. you can install this using ``pip install setuptools -u``\n\n* 32-bit python is not supported. please install the 64-bit version. see [build 32-bit version with 32-bit python section](#build-32-bit-version-with-32-bit-python).\n\n### installation from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/gpboost) using precompiled binaries\n\n```sh\npip install gpboost -u\n```\n\n#### requirements\n\n* for **windows** users, [vc runtime](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) is needed if **visual studio** (2015 or newer) is not installed.\n\n* for **linux** users, **glibc** >= 2.14 is required. \n\n  * if you get an error message ``version `glibc_2.27' not found``, you need to [install from source](#installation-from-source).\n\n  * in rare cases, when you get the ``oserror: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory`` error when importing gpboost, you need to install the openmp runtime library separately (use your package manager and search for ``lib[g|i]omp`` for doing this).\n\n* for **macos** users:\n\n  * the library file in distribution wheels is built by the **apple clang** compiler. you need to install the **openmp** library. you can install the **openmp** library by the following command: ``brew install libomp``. <!-- (xcode version 12.3 is used starting from gpboost version 0.3.0) -->\n\n  * if you have an **arm64 apple silicon** processor (e.g., m1 or m2) and experience problems, try the following steps:\n\n    * [uninstall homebrew](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72890277/i-cant-uninstall-brew-on-macos-apple-silicon) (in case you have migrated from an older non-arm64 mac)\n    * [install homebrew](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/homebrew) (to make sure that you have an arm64 version of libomp)\n    * install openmp (``brew install libomp``)\n    * remove existing python environments and install miniforge (``brew install miniforge`` and ``conda init \"$(basename \"${shell}\")\"``)\n\n### installation from source\n\ninstallation from source can be either done from pypi or github.\n\n#### requirements for installation from source\n\n* installation from source requires that you have installed [**cmake**](https://cmake.org/).\n\n* for **linux** users, **glibc** >= 2.14 is required. \n\n  * in rare cases, you may need to install the openmp runtime library separately (use your package manager and search for ``lib[g|i]omp`` for doing this).\n\n* for **macos** users, you can perform installation either with **apple clang** or **gcc**.\n\n  * in case you prefer **apple clang**, you should install **openmp** (details for installation can be found in the [installation guide](https://github.com/fabsig/gpboost/blob/master/docs/installation_guide.rst#apple-clang)) first and **cmake** version 3.16 or higher is required. only apple clang version 8.1 or higher is supported.\n\n  * in case you prefer **gcc**, you need to install it (details for installation can be found in the [installation guide](https://github.com/fabsig/gpboost/blob/master/docs/installation_guide.rst#gcc)) and specify compilers by running ``export cxx=g++-7 cc=gcc-7`` (replace \"7\" with the version of **gcc** installed on your machine) first.\n\n* for **windows** users, **visual studio** (or [vs build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)) is needed. \n\n\n#### installation from source from pypi\n\n```sh\npip install --no-binary :all: gpboost\n```\n\n##### build with mingw-w64 on windows\n\n```sh\npip install gpboost --install-option=--mingw\n```\n\n* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) should be installed first.\n\n\n##### build 32-bit version with 32-bit python\n\n```sh\npip install gpboost --install-option=--bit32\n```\n\nby default, installation in an environment with 32-bit python is prohibited. however, you can remove this prohibition on your own risk by passing the ``bit32`` option (not recommended).\n\n\n#### installation from source from github\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/fabsig/gpboost.git\ncd gpboost/python-package\n# export cxx=g++-7 cc=gcc-7  # macos users, if you decided to compile with gcc, don't forget to specify compilers (replace \"7\" with version of gcc installed on your machine)\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nnote: ``sudo`` (or administrator rights in **windows**) may be needed to perform the command.\n\n##### build with mingw-w64 on windows\n\n```sh\npython setup.py install --mingw\n```\n* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) should be installed first.\n\nif you get any errors during installation or due to any other reasons, you may want to build a dynamic library from source by any method you prefer and then just run ``python setup.py install --precompile``.\n\n\n",
