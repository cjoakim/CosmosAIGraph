a good place to start is ``doc/source/usage.rst``.\n\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nthis is a typical python library and can be installed using pip::\n\n    pip install xhtml2pdf\n\n\nrequirements\n============\n\nonly python 3.8+ is tested and guaranteed to work.\n\nall additional requirements are listed in the ``pyproject.toml`` file and are installed automatically using the ``pip install .`` method.\n\nas pdf library we depend on reportlab, which has optional c-extensions for performance optimizations.\nfor more information about how to install them, have a look at the `reportlab docs <https://docs.reportlab.com/install/open_source_installation/>`__.\n\n\nalternatives\n============\n\nyou can try `weasyprint <http://weasyprint.org>`__. the codebase is pretty, it has different features and it does a lot of what xhtml2pdf does.\n\n\ncall for testing\n================\n\nthis project is heavily dependent on getting its test coverage up! furthermore, parts of the codebase could do well with cleanups and refactoring.\n\nif you benefit from xhtml2pdf, perhaps look at the `test coverage <https://coveralls.io/github/xhtml2pdf/xhtml2pdf>`__ and identify parts that are yet untouched.\n\n\ndevelopment environment\n=======================\n\n#. if you don't have it, install ``pip``, the python package installer::\n\n    sudo easy_install pip\n\n   for more information about ``pip`` refer to http://www.pip-installer.org\n\n#. we will recommend using ``venv`` for development.\n\n#. create a virtual environment for the project. this can be inside the project directory, but cannot be under version control::\n\n    python -m venv .venv\n\n#. activate your virtual environment::\n\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n\n   later to deactivate it use::\n\n    deactivate\n\n#. the next step will be to install/upgrade dependencies from the ``pyproject.toml`` file::\n\n    pip install -e .[test,docs,build]\n\n#. run tests to check your configuration::\n\n    tox\n\n   you should have a log with the following success status::\n\n    congratulations :) (75.67 seconds)\n\n\npython integration\n==================\n\nsome simple demos of how to integrate xhtml2pdf into a python program may be found here: ``test/simple.py``\n\n\nrunning tests\n=============\n\ntwo different test suites are available to assert that xhtml2pdf works reliably:\n\n#. unit tests. the unit testing framework is currently minimal, but is being\n   improved on a regular basis (contributions welcome). they should run in the\n   expected way for python's unittest module, i.e.::\n\n        tox\n\n#. functional tests. thanks to mawe42's super cool work, a full functional\n   test suite is available at ``testrender/``.\n\nyou can run them using make\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n        make test       # run tests\n        make test-ref   # generate reference data for testrender\n        make test-all   # run all test using tox\n\ncontact\n=======\n\nthis project is community-led! feel free to open up issues on github about new ideas to improve xhtml2pdf.\n\n\nhistory\n=======\n\nthese are the major milestones and the maintainers of the project:\n\n* 2000-2007 dirk holtwick (commercial project of spirito.de)\n* 2007-2010 dirk holtwick (project named \"pisa\", project released as gpl)\n* 2010-2012 dirk holtwick (project named \"xhtml2pdf\", changed license to apache)\n* 2012-2015 chris glass (@chrisglass)\n* 2015-2016 benjamin bach (@benjaoming)\n* 2016-2018 sam spencer (@legostormtroopr)\n* 2018-current luis zarate (@luisza)\n\nfor more history, see the `release notes <https://xhtml2pdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-notes.html>`__.\n\nlicense\n=======\n\ncopyright 2010 dirk holtwick, holtwick.it\n\nlicensed under the apache license, version 2.0 (the \"license\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the license.\nyou may obtain a copy of the license at: http://www.apache.org/licenses/license-2.0\n\nunless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the license is distributed on an \"as is\" basis,\nwithout warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied.\nsee the license for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the license.\n",
