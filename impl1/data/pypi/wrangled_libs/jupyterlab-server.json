  "description": "# jupyterlab server\n\n[![build status](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_server/workflows/tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_server/actions?query=branch%3amaster+workflow%3a%22tests%22)\n[![documentation status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jupyterlab-server/badge/?version=stable)](http://jupyterlab-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n\n## motivation\n\njupyterlab server sits between jupyterlab and jupyter server, and provides a\nset of rest api handlers and utilities that are used by jupyterlab. it is a separate project in order to\naccommodate creating jupyterlab-like applications from a more limited scope.\n\n## install\n\n`pip install jupyterlab_server`\n\nto include optional `openapi` dependencies, use:\n\n`pip install jupyterlab_server[openapi]`\n\nto include optional `pytest_plugin` dependencies, use:\n\n`pip install jupyterlab_server[test]`\n\n## usage\n\nsee the full documentation for [api docs](https://jupyterlab-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/index.html) and [rest endpoint descriptions](https://jupyterlab-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/rest.html).\n\n## extending the application\n\nsubclass the `labserverapp` and provide additional traits and handlers as appropriate for your application.\n\n## contribution\n\nplease see `contributing.md` for details.\n",
