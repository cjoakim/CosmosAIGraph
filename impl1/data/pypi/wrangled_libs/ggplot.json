  "description": "ggplot\n======\n\nwhat is it?\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``ggplot`` is a python implementation of the grammar of graphics. it is\nnot intended to be a feature-for-feature port of\n```ggplot2 for r`` <https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2>`__--though there\nis much greatness in ``ggplot2``, the python world could stand to\nbenefit from it. so there **will be feature overlap**, but not\nneccessarily mimicry (after all, r is a little weird).\n\nyou can do cool things like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x='price', color='clarity')) + \\\n        geom_density() + \\\n        scale_color_brewer(type='div', palette=7) + \\\n        facet_wrap('cut')\n\n.. figure:: ./docs/example.png\n   :alt: \n\ninstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install -u ggplot\n    # or \n    $ conda install -c conda-forge ggplot\n    # or\n    pip install git+https://github.com/yhat/ggplot.git\n\nexamples\n~~~~~~~~\n\nexamples are the best way to learn. there is a jupyter notebook full of\nthem. there are also notebooks that show how to do particular things\nwith ggplot (i.e. `make a scatter\nplot <./docs/how-to/making%20a%20scatter%20plot.ipynb>`__ or `make a\nhistogram <./docs/how-to/making%20a%20scatter%20plot.ipynb>`__).\n\n-  `docs <./docs>`__\n-  `gallery <./docs/gallery.ipynb>`__\n-  `various examples <./examples.md>`__\n\nwhat happened to the old version that didn't work?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nit's gone--the windows, the doors,\n`everything <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuxckv_0gzc>`__. just\nkidding, `you can find it\nhere <https://github.com/yhat/ggplot/tree/v0.6.6>`__, though i'm not\nsure why you'd want to look at it. the data grouping and manipulation\nbits were re-written (so they actually worked) with things like facets\nin mind.\n\ncontributing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nthanks to all of the ggplot\n`contributors <./contributors.md#contributors>`__! see\n*`contributing.md <./contributing.md>`__*.\n",
