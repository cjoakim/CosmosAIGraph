  "description": "flake8 copyright plugin\n=======================\n\nchecks for copyright notices in all python files. it runs a simple regular expression search for\nstrings like::\n\n    copyright 2014 <author>\n    copyright (c) 2014 <author>\n\n``<author>`` can be anything unless you specify it with the ``copyright-author`` option (see below).\n\ninstall\n-------\n\ninstall with pip::\n\n    pip install flake8-copyright\n\nthen, activate copyright checks in your flake8 configuration with::\n\n    copyright-check = true\n    # c errors are not selected by default, so add them to your selection\n    select = e,f,w,c\n\n\nfurther options\n---------------\n\ncopyright-min-file-size\n    minimum number of characters in a file before requiring a copyright notice. this is to avoid\n    forcing yourself to add copyright notices to very small or empty files. default: ``0``.\n\ncopyright-author\n    checks for a specific author in the copyright notice.\n\ncopyright-regexp\n    if you're not happy with the regexp that is ran to look for copyright notices, you can change it\n    with this option. default: ``copyright\\s+(\\(c\\)\\s+)?\\d{4}([-,]\\d{4})*\\s+%(author)s``. ``%(author)s`` is\n    replaced by the contents of ``copyright-author``.\n\n\n",
