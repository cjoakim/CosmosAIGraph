  "description": "# model-index: maintain a source of truth for ml models\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\n<a href=\"https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/paperswithcode/model-index\">\n  <img alt=\"tests\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/paperswithcode/model-index/main\">\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/model-index/\">\n  <img alt=\"pypi\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/model-index\">\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://model-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">\n  <img alt=\"docs\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/model-index\">\n</a>\n\n</p>\n\n`model-index` has two goals:\n- make it easy to maintain a source-of-truth index of machine learning model metadata \n- enable the community browse this model metadata on [papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/)\n\nthe main design principle of `model-index` is **flexibility**. you can store your model metadata however is the\nmost convenient for you - as jsons, yamls or as annotations inside markdown. `model-index` provides a convenient\nway to collect all this metadata into a single file that's browsable, searchable and comparable.\n\nyou can use this library locally or choose to upload the metadata to [papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com)\nto have your library featured on the website. \n\n## how it works\n\nthere is a root file for the model index: `model-index.yml` that links to (or contains) metadata. \n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: inception v3\n    metadata:\n      flops: 5731284192\n      parameters: 23834568\n      training data: imagenet  \n      training resources: 8x v100 gpus\n    results:\n      - task: image classification\n        dataset: imagenet\n        metrics:\n          top 1 accuracy: 74.67%\n          top 5 accuracy: 92.1%\n    paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567v3\n    code: https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/blob/timm/models/inception_v3.py#l442\n    weights: https://download.pytorch.org/models/inception_v3_google-1a9a5a14.pth \n    readme: docs/inception-v3-readme.md\n```\n\nall fields except for `name` are **optional**. you can add any fields you like, but the ones above have a \nstandard meaning across different models and libraries. \n\nwe recommend putting the `model-index.yml` file in the root of your repository (so that relative links such as \n`docs/inception-v3-readme.md` are easier to write), but you can also put it anywhere else in the repository (e.g.\nin your `docs/` or `models/` folder). \n\n### storing metadata in markdown files\n\nmetadata can also be directly stored in a model's readme file. for example in this `docs/rexnet.md` file:\n\n```markdown\n<!--\ntype: model-index\nname: rexnet\nmetadata: \n  epochs: 400\n  batch size: 512\npaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00992v1\n-->\n\n# summary\n\nrank expansion networks (rexnets) follow a set of new design \nprinciples for designing bottlenecks in image classification models.\n\n## usage\n\nimport timm\nm = timm.create_model('rexnet_100', pretrained=true)\nm.eval()\n```\n\nin this case, you just need to include this markdown file into the global `model-index.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - docs/rexnet.md\n```\n\n## get started\n\ncheck out our [official documentation](https://model-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on how to get started. \n\n## uploading to papers with code\n\nto feature your library on papers with code, get in touch with `hello@paperswithcode.com` and the model index\nof your library will be automatically included into papers with code. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
