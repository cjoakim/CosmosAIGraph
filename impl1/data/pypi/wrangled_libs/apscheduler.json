[#f1] the cutoff period for this is also configurable.\n\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\ndocumentation can be found `here <https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\n\nsource\n------\n\nthe source can be browsed at `github <https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler/tree/3.x>`_.\n\n\nreporting bugs\n--------------\n\na `bug tracker <https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler/issues>`_ is provided by github.\n\n\ngetting help\n------------\n\nif you have problems or other questions, you can either:\n\n* ask in the `apscheduler <https://gitter.im/apscheduler/lobby>`_ room on gitter\n* ask on the `apscheduler github discussion forum <https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler/discussions>`_, or\n* ask on `stackoverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apscheduler>`_ and tag your\n  question with the ``apscheduler`` tag\n",
