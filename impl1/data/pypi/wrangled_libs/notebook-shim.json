  "description": "# notebook shim\n\nthis project provides a way for jupyterlab and other frontends to switch to [jupyter server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/) for their python web application backend.\n\n## basic usage\n\ninstall from pypi:\n\n```\npip install notebook_shim\n```\n\nthis will automatically enable the extension in jupyter server.\n\n## usage\n\nthis project also includes an api for shimming traits that moved from `notebookapp` in to `serverapp` in jupyter server. this can be used by applications that subclassed `notebookapp` to leverage the python server backend of jupyter notebooks. such extensions should *now* switch to `extensionapp` api in jupyter server and add `notebookconfigshimmixin` in their inheritance list to properly handle moved traits.\n\nfor example, an application class that previously looked like:\n\n```python\nfrom notebook.notebookapp import notebookapp\n\nclass myapplication(notebookapp):\n```\n\nshould switch to look something like:\n\n```python\nfrom jupyter_server.extension.application import extensionapp\nfrom notebook_shim.shim import notebookconfigshimmixin\n\nclass myapplication(notebookconfigshimmixin, extensionapp):\n```",
