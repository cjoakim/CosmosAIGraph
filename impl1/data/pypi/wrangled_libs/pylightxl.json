copy the single source file into your project without any extra\n      dependency issues or setup.\n    - do you struggle with other libraries weighing your projects down due to their very large size? pylightxl's\n      single source file size and zero dependency will not weigh your project down (preferable for django apps)\n    - do you struggle with ``pyinstaller`` or other ``exe`` wrappers failing to build or building to very large\n      packages? pylightxl will not cause any build errors and will not add to your build size since it has zero\n      dependencies and a small lib size.\n    - do you struggle with download restrictions at your company? copy the entire pylightxl source from 1 single file\n      and use it in your project.\n\n- **100% test-driven development for highest reliability/maintainability that aims for 100% coverage on all supported versions**\n\n    - pylightxl aims to test all of its features, however unforeseen edge cases can occur when receiving excel files\n      created by non-microsoft excel. we actively monitor issues to add support for these edge cases should they arise.\n\n- **api aimed to be user friendly and intuitive and well documented. structure: database > worksheet > indexing**\n\n    - ``db.ws('sheet1').index(row=1,col=2)``  or ``db.ws('sheet1').address(address='b1')``\n    - ``db.ws('sheet1').row(1)`` or ``db.ws('sheet1').col(1)``\n\n---\n\n#### **setup**\npylightxl is officially published on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org), however one of the\nkey features of pylightxl is that it is packed light in case the user has pip\nand/or download restrictions, see [docs - installation](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)\n\n```pip install pylightxl```\n\n---\n\n#### **pypi version 1.61**\n\n- bug-fix: occasionally a `<definedname>` tag would case pylightxl to add duplicate of the same worksheet, see issue [#72](https://github.com/pydpiper/pylightxl/issues/75)\n- update: updated date handling (code cleanup)\n- added feature: added python2 compatible typing to the library\n- added feature: added `io.stringio` support to `readcsv`\n\nsee full history log of revisions: [here](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/revlog.html)\n\n---\n\n#### **contact/questions/suggestions**\nif you have any questions or feedback, we would love to hear from you - send us \na post directly on [github](https://github.com/pydpiper/pylightxl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=pylightxl-issue-template.md&title=).\n\nwe try to keep an active lookout for users trying to solve microsoft excel related problems with\npython on stack overflow. please help us build on the great community that python already is by\nhelping others get up to speed with pylightxl!\n\nfrom everyone in the pylightxl family, thank you for visiting!\n\n![logo](doc/source/_static/logo.png)",
