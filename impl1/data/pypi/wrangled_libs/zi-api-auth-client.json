  "description": "zi_api_auth_client\n==============================\n\nthis library supports 2 types of authentication methods. both the methods return a jwt token which you can use to make\napi calls for enterprise-api on production.\n\nusername and password authentication:\n============================================================\n\n**usage:**\n\n1. import zi_api_auth_client\n\n2. jwt_token = zi_api_auth_client.user_name_pwd_authentication(\"your_user_name\", \"your_password\")\n\npki authentication:\n==============================\n\nthis type of authentication needs a private key and a client id to generate the jwt token.\n\n**usage:**\n\n1. import zi_api_auth_client\n\n2. paste your private key:\n\n        key = '''\n\n        -----begin private key-----\n\n        your private key goes here\n\n        -----end private key-----'''\n\n3. jwt_token = zi_api_auth_client.pki_authentication(\"your_user_name\", \"your_client_id\", key)\n\n**note: if you get the error \"valueerror: could not deserialize key data.\" when doing pki authentication, make sure that your private key is properly formatted. paste the private key as a multi-line string in python.**\n\n**correct way:**\n\nthe following is the right way to paste your private key.\n\n\n    '''\n\n    -----begin private key-----\n\n    your private key goes here\n\n    -----end private key-----'''\n\n**wrong way:**\n\npasting the private key as follows would throw the error \"valueerror: could not deserialize key data.\" because there are extra spaces on each line in the key.\n\n\n       '''\n\n            -----begin private key-----\n\n            your private key goes here\n\n            -----end private key-----'''\n",
