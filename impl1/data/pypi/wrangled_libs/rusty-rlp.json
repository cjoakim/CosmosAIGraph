  "description": "# rusty-rlp\n\nrapid fast rlp serialization / deserialization for python.\n\nas the name suggest, `rusty-rlp` is written in rust and based on the battle-tested, mit-licensed\n`rlp` implementation that is also used by [openethereum](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum).\n\n## usage\n\n```python\nfrom rusty_rlp import decode_raw, encode_raw\n\nencoded = encode_raw(b'some_string')\ndecoded = decode_raw(encoded)\n```\n\n## running the tests\n\nthe library exposes a pure python api and all tests are implemented in [`python_tests.py`](https://github.com/cburgdorf/rusty-rlp/blob/master/python_tests.py)\n\nrun the tests:\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\n**note:** there do exists some tests implemented in rust that can be run with `cargo tests` but those do not test *this* library but the underlying `rlp` library instead. they exist merely to prove some assumptions about the underlying library.\n\n\n## benchmarks\n\nwe provide some benchmarks against [`pyrlp`](https://github.com/ethereum/pyrlp).\n\n|           |    encoding (msec/loop) |  decoding (msec/loop) |\n|-----------|:-----------------------:|----------------------:|\n| pyrlp     |  0.016                  |   0.014               |\n| rusty-rlp |  0.00173 (~9x)          |   0.00595 (~2.35x)    |\n\n\n### running the benchmarks\n\n```\nmake benchmark\n```\n",
