  "description": "# subprocess-tee\n\nthis package provides a drop-in alternative to `subprocess.run` that\ncaptures the output while still printing it in **real-time**, just the way\n`tee` does.\n\nprinting output in real-time while still capturing is valuable for\nany tool that executes long-running child processes. for those, you do want\nto provide instant feedback (progress) related to what is happening.\n\n```python\n# from subprocess import run\nfrom subprocess_tee import run\n\nresult = run(\"echo 123\")\nresult.stdout == \"123\\n\"\n```\n\nyou can add `tee=false` to disable the tee functionality if you want, this\nbeing a much shorter alternative than adding the well known\n`stdout=subprocess.devnull, stderr=subprocess.devnull`.\n\nkeep in mind that `universal_newlines=true` is implied as we expect text\nprocessing, this being a divergence from the original `subprocess.run`.\n\nyou can still use `check=true` in order to make it raise completedprocess\nexception when the result code is not zero.\n",
