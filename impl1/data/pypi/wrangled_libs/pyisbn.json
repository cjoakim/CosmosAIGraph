  "description": "``pyisbn`` - a module for working with 10- and 13-digit isbns\n=============================================================\n\n|status| |travis| |coveralls| |pypi| |pyvers| |readthedocs| |develop|\n\nintroduction\n------------\n\n``pyisbn`` is a `gpl v3`_ licensed module for working with various book\nidentification numbers.  it includes functions for conversion, verification and\ngeneration of checksums.  it also includes basic classes for representing isbns\nas objects.\n\nsee the ``doc`` directory for installation instructions and usage information,\nyou can also `view the content online`_.\n\nrequirements\n------------\n\n``pyisbn`` does not depend on any modules that aren\u2019t included in python_\u2019s\nstandard library, and as such should run with python 3.6 or newer [#]_.  if\n``pyisbn`` doesn\u2019t work with the version of python you have installed, open an\nissue_ and i\u2019ll endeavour to fix it.\n\nthe module have been tested on many unix-like systems, including linux and os x,\nbut it should work fine on other systems too.\n\n.. [#] versions v1.2 and earlier will run on older python versions, right back\n       to 2.4.\n\nexample\n-------\n\nthe simplest way to show how ``pyisbn`` works is by example, and here goes::\n\n    >>> import pyisbn\n    >>> permutation_city = \"1-85798-218-5\"\n    >>> pyisbn.validate(permutation_city)\n    true\n    >>> pyisbn.convert(permutation_city)\n    '9781857982183'\n\nor using the object pattern use::\n\n    >>> permutation_city = pyisbn.isbn10(\"1-85798-218-5\")\n    >>> permutation_city.validate()\n    true\n    >>> permutation_city.convert()\n    '9781857982183'\n    >>> print(permutation_city)\n    isbn 1-85798-218-5\n\nall independent functions and classes contain (hopefully) useful docstrings.\n\napi stability\n-------------\n\nnow that ``pyisbn`` 1.0 has been released the api will is frozen, and any\nchanges which aren\u2019t backwards compatible will force a major version bump.\n\ncontributors\n------------\n\ni\u2019d like to thank the following people who have contributed to ``pyisbn``.\n\npatches\n'''''''\n\n* christopher wells\n\nbug reports\n'''''''''''\n\n* james gaffney\n* hbc (bcho)\n* wen heping\n* max klein (notconfusing)\n* matt leighy\n* nathaniel m. beaver (nbeaver)\n* randy syring (rsyring)\n* stephen thorne\n\nideas\n'''''\n\n* kevin simmons\n\nif i\u2019ve forgotten to include your name i wholeheartedly apologise.  just drop\nme a mail_ and i\u2019ll update the list!\n\nbugs\n----\n\nif you find any problems, bugs or just have a question about this package\neither file an issue_ or drop me a mail_.\n\nif you\u2019ve found a bug please attempt to include a minimal testcase so i can\nreproduce the problem, or even better a patch!\n\n.. _gpl v3: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\n.. _view the content online: http://pyisbn.rtfd.org/\n.. _python: http://www.python.org/\n.. _issue: https://github.com/jnrowe/pyisbn/issues\n.. _mail: jnrowe@gmail.com\n\n.. |travis| image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/jnrowe/pyisbn.png\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/jnrowe/pyisbn\n   :alt: test state on master\n\n.. |develop| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/jnrowe/pyisbn/latest.png\n   :target: https://github.com/jnrowe/pyisbn\n   :alt: recent developments\n\n.. |pyvers| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyisbn.png\n   :alt: supported python versions\n\n.. |status| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/pyisbn.png\n   :alt: development status\n\n.. |coveralls| image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/github/jnrowe/pyisbn/master.png\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/repos/jnrowe/pyisbn\n   :alt: coverage state on master\n\n.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyisbn.png\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/pyisbn/\n   :alt: current pypi release\n\n.. |readthedocs| image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/pyisbn/stable.png\n   :target: https://pyisbn.readthedocs.io/\n   :alt: documentation\n\n\n",
