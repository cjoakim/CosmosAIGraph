  "description": "# `ldap` on pypi\n\nthis dummy project is not installable.\nyou probably want `python-ldap` instead.\n\n\n### python-ldap\n\nthe widely used [python-ldap](https://python-ldap.org) project provides\nan importable module named `ldap`.\n\nthis goes against the convention that pypi distribution names should\nmatch the module names.\nbut, python-ldap pre-dates wide use of that convention, and the issue\nis hard to fix now.\n\nplease install `python-ldap` to get the ldap bindings.\n\n\n### ldap 1.0\n\nthe `ldap` name on pypi was used for an unrelated collection of\nldap-related utilities, which is not as popular, and confused users who\ninstall `ldap` to get the `ldap` module.\n\nthe project is no longer developed.\nit is archived as `1.0.x` releases on pypi, and on\n[github](https://github.com/andreif/ldap).\n\n\n## why we don't fix this transparently\n\nthis could have been a placeholder  package that depends on `python-ldap`,\nsaving you the trouble of reading this message.\n\nhowever, `pip` [has trouble](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4961)\nwith differently-named packages that provide the same module.\n\n\n## please: don't install packages blindly\n\nwhen you see the exception:\n\n```\nmodulenotfounderror: no module named 'foo'\n```\n\n\u2026 please research the actual requirements instead of going directly for\n`pip install foo`.\nthe project (distribution) name may differ from the module(s) it\nprovides.",
