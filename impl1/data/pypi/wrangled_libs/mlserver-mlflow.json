  "description": "# mlflow runtime for mlserver\n\nthis package provides a mlserver runtime compatible with [mlflow\nmodels](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html).\n\n## usage\n\nyou can install the runtime, alongside `mlserver`, as:\n\n```bash\npip install mlserver mlserver-mlflow\n```\n\n## content types\n\nthe mlflow inference runtime introduces a new `dict` content type, which\ndecodes an incoming v2 request as a [dictionary of\ntensors](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#deploy-mlflow-models).\nthis is useful for certain mlflow-serialised models, which will expect that the\nmodel inputs are serialised in this format.\n\n```{note}\nthe `dict` content type can be _stacked_ with other content types, like\n[`np`](../../docs/user-guide/content-type).\nthis allows the user to use a different set of content types to decode each of\nthe dict entries.\n```\n\n\n",
