  "description": "\ufeff# flake8-pyproject\n*flake8 plug-in loading the configuration from `pyproject.toml`*\n\n[flake8] cannot be configured via `pyproject.toml`, even though\nvirtually all other python dev tools have adopted it as the central\nlocation for project configuration. the discussion of the original\nproposal ([#234]) was closed as \"too heated\", subsequent feature\nand pull requests were marked as \"spam\" ([#1332], [#1421], [#1431],\n[#1447], [#1501]).\n\nflake8-pyproject also has bad manners and force-feeds flake8 the\nspam it so despises. it registers itself as a flake8 plug-in to\nseamlessly load the configuration from `pyproject.toml` when you\nrun the `flake8` command.\n\n[flake8]: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8\n[#234]:   https://github.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/234\n[#1332]:  https://github.com/pycqa/flake8/pull/1332\n[#1421]:  https://github.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/1421\n[#1431]:  https://github.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/1431\n[#1447]:  https://github.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/1447\n[#1501]:  https://github.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/1501\n\n\n## usage\n\nsay your flake8 configuration in `.flake8` (or in `tox.ini`, or\n`setup.cfg`) is this:\n```ini\n[flake8]\nignore = e231, e241\nper-file-ignores =\n    __init__.py:f401\nmax-line-length = 88\ncount = true\n```\n\ncopy that `[flake8]` section to `pyproject.toml`, rename it as\n`[tool.flake8]`, and convert the key\u2013value pairs to the [toml format]:\n```toml\n[tool.flake8]\nignore = ['e231', 'e241']\nper-file-ignores = [\n    '__init__.py:f401',\n]\nmax-line-length = 88\ncount = true\n```\n\nthen run `flake8` in the project root folder, where `pyproject.toml`\nis located.\n\nin case your toml-based configuration is contained in a different\nfolder, or the file has a different name, specify the location with\nthe `--toml-config` command-line option.\n\nfor compatibility with earlier versions of this package, and perhaps\nextra reliability in terms of possible future breakage of the plug-in\nhook, the package also provides a `flake8p` command that could be\ncalled alternatively to lint the code.\n\n[toml format]: https://toml.io\n",
