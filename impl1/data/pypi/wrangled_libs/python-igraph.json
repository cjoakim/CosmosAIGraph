  "description": "python interface to the igraph high performance graph\nlibrary, primarily aimed at complex network research and analysis.\n\n**this package is deprecated; use the igraph package instead. this package will\nbe kept in sync with igraph until sep 1, 2022 and it will not receive any\nupdates after sep 1, 2022.**\n\ngraph plotting functionality is provided by the cairo library, so make\nsure you install the python bindings of cairo if you want to generate\npublication-quality graph plots. you can try either `pycairo\n<http://cairographics.org/pycairo>`_ or `cairocffi <http://cairocffi.readthedocs.io>`_,\n``cairocffi`` is recommended because there were bug reports affecting igraph\ngraph plots in jupyter notebooks when using ``pycairo`` (but not with\n``cairocffi``).\n",
