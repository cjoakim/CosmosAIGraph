  "description": "lab and downward lab\n====================\n\n**lab** is a python package for evaluating solvers on benchmark sets.\nexperiments can run on a single machine or on a computer cluster. the\npackage also contains code for parsing results and creating reports.\n\nthe **downward lab** python package facilitates running experiments for\nthe `fast downward <http://www.fast-downward.org>`_ planning system. it\nuses the generic experimentation package **lab**. currently, lab and\ndownward lab are distributed together.\n\n**code**: https://github.com/aibasel/lab\n\n**documentation**: https://lab.readthedocs.io\n\n**cite**: please cite downward lab by using\n\n::\n\n    @misc{seipp-et-al-zenodo2017,\n      author =       \"jendrik seipp and florian pommerening and\n                      silvan sievers and malte helmert\",\n      title =        \"{downward} {lab}\",\n      publisher =    \"zenodo\",\n      year =         \"2017\",\n      howpublished = \"\\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.790461}\"\n    }\n\n\ninstall lab\n-----------\n\nlab requires python 3.7+ and linux (e.g., ubuntu). we recommend installing\nlab in a `python virtual environment\n<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_. this has the advantage\nthat there are no modifications to the system-wide configuration, and that\nyou can create multiple environments with different lab versions (e.g.,\nfor different papers) without conflicts::\n\n    # install required packages, including virtualenv.\n    sudo apt install python3 python3-venv\n\n    # create a new directory for your experiments.\n    mkdir experiments-for-my-paper\n    cd experiments-for-my-paper\n\n    # if pythonpath is set, unset it to obtain a clean environment.\n    unset pythonpath\n\n    # create and activate a python virtual environment for lab.\n    python3 -m venv --prompt my-paper .venv\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n\n    # install lab in the virtual environment.\n    pip install -u pip wheel\n    pip install lab  # or preferably a specific version with lab==x.y\n\n    # store installed packages and exact versions for reproducibility.\n    # ignore pkg-resources package (https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4022).\n    pip freeze | grep -v \"pkg-resources\" > requirements.txt\n\nplease note that before running an experiment script you need to\nactivate the virtual environment with::\n\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n\nwe recommend clearing the ``pythonpath`` variable before activating the\nvirtual environment.\n",
