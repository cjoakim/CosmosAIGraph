for macos, use \"pip3 install mmh3\" and python3\n```\n\n### simple functions\nquickstart:\n```shell\n>>> import mmh3\n>>> mmh3.hash(\"foo\") # returns a 32-bit signed int\n-156908512\n>>> mmh3.hash(\"foo\", 42) # uses 42 as a seed\n-1322301282\n>>> mmh3.hash(\"foo\", signed=false) # returns a 32-bit unsigned int\n4138058784\n```\n\nother functions:\n```shell\n>>> mmh3.hash64(\"foo\") # two 64 bit signed ints (by using the 128-bit algorithm as its backend)\n(-2129773440516405919, 9128664383759220103)\n>>> mmh3.hash64(\"foo\", signed=false) #  two 64 bit unsigned ints\n(16316970633193145697, 9128664383759220103)\n>>> mmh3.hash128(\"foo\", 42) # 128 bit unsigned int\n215966891540331383248189432718888555506\n>>> mmh3.hash128(\"foo\", 42, signed=true) # 128 bit signed int\n-124315475380607080215185174712879655950\n>>> mmh3.hash_bytes(\"foo\") # 128 bit value as bytes\n'ae\\xf5\\x01w\\x86q\\xe2\\x87}\\xba+\\xe4\\x87\\xaf~'\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> a = np.zeros(2 ** 32, dtype=np.int8)\n>>> mmh3.hash_bytes(a)\nb'v\\x8f}\\xad\\x8enm\\xa84\\x07fu\\x9c\\xc4\\xcc\\x8e'\n```\n\nbeware that `hash64` returns **two** values, because it uses the 128-bit version of murmurhash3 as its backend.\n\n`hash_from_buffer` hashes byte-likes without memory copying. the method is suitable when you hash a large memory-view such as `numpy.ndarray`.\n\n```shell\n>>> mmh3.hash_from_buffer(numpy.random.rand(100))\n-2137204694\n>>> mmh3.hash_from_buffer(numpy.random.rand(100), signed=false)\n3812874078\n```\n\n`hash64`, `hash128`, and `hash_bytes` have the third argument for architecture optimization. use true for x64 and false for x86 (default: true):\n\n```shell\n>>> mmh3.hash64(\"foo\", 42, true) \n(-840311307571801102, -6739155424061121879)\n```\n\n### `hashlib`-style hashers\n`mmh3` implements hashers whose interfaces are similar to `hashlib` in the standard library: `mmh3_32()` for 32 bit hashing, `mmh3_x64_128()` for 128 bit hashing optimized for x64 architectures, and `mmh3_x86_128()` for 128 bit hashing optimized for x86 architectures.\n\nin addition to the standard `digest()` method, each hasher has `sintdigest()`, which returns a signed integer, and `uintdigest()`, which returns an unsigned integer. 128 bit hashers also have `stupledigest()` and `utupledigest()` which return two 64 bit integers.\n\nnote that as of version 4.0.1, the implementation is still experimental and its performance can be unsatisfactory (especially `mmh3_x86_128()`). also, `hexdigest()` is not supported. use `digest().hex()` instead.\n\n```shell\n>>> import mmh3\n>>> hasher = mmh3.mmh3_x64_128(seed=42)\n>>> hasher.update(b\"foo\")\n>>> hasher.update(b\"bar\")\n>>> hasher.update(\"foo\") # str inputs are not allowed for hashers\ntypeerror: strings must be encoded before hashing\ntraceback (most recent call last):\n  file \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n>>> hasher.digest()\nb'\\x82_n\\xdd \\xac\\xb6j\\xef\\x99\\xb1e\\xc4\\n\\xc9\\xfd'\n>>> hasher.sintdigest() # 128 bit signed int\n-2943813934500665152301506963178627198\n>>> hasher.uintdigest() # 128 bit unsigned int\n337338552986437798311073100468589584258\n>>> hasher.stupledigest() # two 64 bit signed ints\n(7689522670935629698, -159584473158936081)\n>>> hasher.utupledigest() # two 64 bit unsigned ints\n(7689522670935629698, 18287159600550615535)\n```\n\n## changelog\n### 4.0.1 (2023-07-14)\n* fix incorrect type hints.\n* refactor the project structure (<https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3/issues/48>).\n\n### 4.0.0 (2023-05-22)\n* add experimental support for `hashlib`-compliant hasher classes (<https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3/issues/39>). note that they are not yet fully tuned for performance.\n* add support for type hints (<https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3/issues/44>).\n* add wheels for more platforms (`musllinux`, `s390x`, `win_arm64`, and `macosx_universal2`).\n* drop support for python 3.7, as it will reach the end of life on 2023-06-27.\n* switch license from cc0 to mit (<https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3/issues/43>).\n* add a code of conduct (the acm code of ethics and professional conduct).\n* backward incompatible changes:\n  * a hash function now returns the same value under big-endian platforms as that under little-endian ones (<https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3/issues/47>).\n  * remove the `__version__` constant from the module (<https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3/issues/42>). use `importlib.metadata` instead.\n\n### 3.1.0 (2023-03-24)\n* add support for python 3.10 and 3.11. thanks [wouter bolsterlee](https://github.com/wbolster) and [du\u0161an nikoli\u0107](https://github.com/n-dusan)!\n* drop support for python 3.6; remove legacy code for python 2.x at the source code level.\n* add support for 32-bit architectures such as `i686` and `armv7l`. from now on, `hash` and `hash_from_buffer` on these architectures will generate the same hash values as those on other environments. thanks [danil shein](https://github.com/dshein-alt)!\n* in relation to the above, `manylinux2014_i686` wheels are now available.\n* support for hashing huge data (>16gb). thanks [arieleizenberg](https://github.com/arieleizenberg)!\n\nsee [changelog.md](./changelog.md) for the complete changelog.\n\n## license\n[mit](./license), unless otherwise noted within a file.\n\n## known issues\n### getting different results from other murmurhash3-based libraries\nby default, mmh3 returns **signed** values for 32-bit and 64-bit versions and **unsigned** values for `hash128`, due to historical reasons. please use the keyword argument `signed` to obtain a desired result.\n\nfrom version 4.0.0, `mmh3` returns the same value under big-endian platforms\n    as that under little-endian ones, while the original c++ library is endian-sensitive. if you need to obtain the original-compliant results under big-endian environments, please use version 3.*.\n\nfor compatibility with [google guava (java)](https://github.com/google/guava), see <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29932956/murmur3-hash-different-result-between-python-and-java-implementation>.\n\nfor compatibility with [murmur3 (go)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spaolacci/murmur3), see <https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3/issues/46>.\n\n### unexpected results when given non 32-bit seeds\nversion 2.4 changed the type of seeds from signed 32-bit int to unsigned 32-bit int. the resulting values with signed seeds still remain the same as before, as long as they are 32-bit.\n\n```shell\n>>> mmh3.hash(\"aaaa\", -1756908916) # signed representation for 0x9747b28c\n1519878282\n>>> mmh3.hash(\"aaaa\", 2538058380) # unsigned representation for 0x9747b28c\n1519878282\n```\n\nbe careful so that these seeds do not exceed 32-bit. unexpected results may happen with invalid values.\n\n```shell\n>>> mmh3.hash(\"foo\", 2 ** 33)\n-156908512\n>>> mmh3.hash(\"foo\", 2 ** 34)\n-156908512\n```\n\n## authors\nmurmurhash3 was originally developed by austin appleby and distributed under public domain [https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher).\n\nported and modified for python by hajime senuma.\n\n## see also\n### tutorials (high-performance computing)\nthe following textbooks and tutorials are great sources to learn how to use mmh3 (and other hash algorithms in general) for high-performance computing.\n\n* chapter 11: *using less ram* in micha gorelick and ian ozsvald. 2014. *high performance python: practical performant programming for humans*. o'reilly media.
