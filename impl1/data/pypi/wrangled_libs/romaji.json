  "description": "romaji\n------\n`romaji` is a converter library to romanize japanese hiragana/katakana string by standard and ime typing style.\neven though `pykakasi <https://pypi.org/project/pykakasi/>`_ already has provided the same functions, and returns only one romanized string.\nhowever, there exists several different romanization systems, so one hiragana/katakana string has so many romanize string.\nfor example, `\"\u3061\u3083\"` can be romanized as `\"cha\"`, `\"tya\"`, `\"chixya\"`, `\"tixya\"`, `\"chilya\"`, or `\"tilya\"`.\n`romaji` provides romanized strings as many as possible.\n\nif an input string contained non hiragana/katakana characters (includes kanji), `romaji` return the characters as same as the input.\nfor example, `romaji` converts the input `\"\u304a\u8336\u306e\u6c34\"` to `\"o\u8336no\u6c34\"`.\nif there is a need to romanize the whole string which includes kanji, `romaji` can romaize the readings in the tokens which `janome <https://pypi.org/project/janome/>`_  tokenizer provides.\n`romaji` strongly recommends to use with `janome`.\n\nthe mapping from hiragana/katakana to romaji is based on common ime's system to input japanese.\ntherefor, `romaji` does not directly implement the standard system like hepburn, nihon-shiki or kunrei-shiki, but includes them.\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install romaji\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import romaji\n    >>> romaji.transliterate('\u50d5\u30c9\u30e9\u3048\u3082\u3093')\n    ['\u50d5doraemon', '\u50d5doraemon\\'', '\u50d5doraemonn']\n    >>> romaji.transliterate('\u8af8\u884c\u7121\u5e38')\n    []\n\n\n",
