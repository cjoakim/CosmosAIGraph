  "description": "=====================\n javascript minifier\n=====================\n\nrjsmin is a javascript minifier written in python.\n\nthe minifier is based on the semantics of `jsmin.c by douglas crockford`_\\.\n\nthe module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at\nruntime (rather than during a preprocessing step). usually it produces the\nsame results as the original ``jsmin.c``. it differs in the following ways:\n\n- there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment\n  literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.\n- control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they\n  are not converted to spaces (nor to \\n)\n- newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except\n  for line continuations in string literals (ecma-5).\n- \"return /regex/\" is recognized correctly.\n- more characters are allowed before regexes.\n- line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly\n- \"+ +\" and \"- -\" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'\n- newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly\n- (unnested) template literals are supported (ecma-6)\n- comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally\n- rjsmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (however, the\n  module provides a \"streamy\" interface).\n\nsince most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster\nthan the original python port of ``jsmin.c`` by baruch even. the speed factor\nvaries between about 6 and 55 depending on input and python version (it gets\nfaster the more compressed the input already is).  compared to the\nspeed-refactored python port by dave st.germain the performance gain is less\ndramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). see the\ndocs/benchmarks file for details.\n\nrjsmin.c is a reimplementation of rjsmin.py in c and speeds it up even more.\n\nsupported python versions are 2.7 and 3.6+.\n\n.. _jsmin.c by douglas crockford: http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.c\n\n\ncopyright and license\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\ncopyright 2011 - 2023\nandr\u00e9 malo or his licensors, as applicable.\n\nthe whole package (except for the files in the bench/ directory) is\ndistributed under the apache license version 2.0. you'll find a copy in the\nroot directory of the distribution or online at:\n<http://www.apache.org/licenses/license-2.0>.\n\n\nbugs\n~~~~\n\nno bugs, of course. ;-)\nbut if you've found one or have an idea how to improve rjsmin, feel free\nto send a pull request on `github <https://github.com/ndparker/rjsmin>`_\nor send a mail to <rjsmin-bugs@perlig.de>.\n\n\nauthor information\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nandr\u00e9 \"nd\" malo <nd perlig.de>\ngpg: 0x029c942244325167\n\n\n    if god intended people to be naked, they would be born that way.\n    -- oscar wilde\n\n.. vim:tw=72 syntax=rest\n",
