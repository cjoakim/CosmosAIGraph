what is tox-factor?\n\ntox-factor enables running a subset of tox test envs, based on factor matching.\n\n\n## okay, but what does that *actually* mean?\n\ntake the following tox config:\n\n```ini\n[tox]\nenvlist =\n    py{35,36,37}-django{20,21,22}-{redis,memcached}\n```\n\nthe above defines 18 test envs, based on three factor groups - the python\nversion, the django version, and a caching backend. while the above is powerful,\ntox does not provide a way to run builds based on a subset of those factors.\nfor example, the call to run all python 3.7 builds would be:\n\n```shell\n$ tox -e py37-django20-redis,py37-django20-memcached,py37-django21-redis,py37-django21-memcached,py37-django22-redis,py37-django22-memcached\n```\n\ntox-factor functions similarly to the `-e <env name>` argument, except it runs\nall envs that match the given factor. the six `py37` builds could be ran with:\n\n```shell\n$ tox -f py37\n```\n\nin addition to ease of use when running tox locally, this is useful for some ci\nsetups. for example, two common tox ci patterns are to either:\n\n- define a ci job for each tox test env. e.g.,\n\n    `tox -e py37-django20-redis`\n\n- define a ci job for a common environment that runs multiple test envs. e.g.,\n\n    `tox -e py37-django20-redis,py37-django20-memcached,...`\n\nfor the latter case, this plugin eases maintenance of ci, as it could be\nshortened to `tox -f py37`. additionally, take the following update to the above\ntox config:\n\n```ini\n[tox]\nenvlist =\n    py{35,36,37}-django{20,21,22}-{redis,memcached}\n    py{36,37,38}-django{30}-{redis,memcached}\n```\n\nby using tox-factor, it wouldn't be necessary to update the python 3.7 build, as\nthe new `py37-django30-*` env would be matched automatically.\n\n\n\n## verifying the matched test envs\n\nif you want to verify which test envs are actually ran, combine the factor\nmatching with the `-l` flag. this will display all test envs that match. e.g.,\n\n```shell\n$ tox -f py37 -l\npy37-django20-redis\npy37-django20-memcached\npy37-django21-redis\npy37-django21-memcached\npy37-django22-redis\npy37-django22-memcached\n```\n\n\n## usage details\n\nthe factor option accepts a comma-separated list (similar to the `-e` option).\n```shell\n$ tox -f py27,py37 -l\npy27-django111\npy37-django21\n```\n\nalternatively, factors can be provided via the `toxfactor` environment variable:\n```shell\n$ toxfactor=py27,py37 tox -l\npy27-django111\npy37-django21\n```\n\nfactors can also match non-generative env names. for example, given the\nfollowing tox config:\n\n```ini\n[tox]\nenvlist =\n    py{35,36,37}-django20\n\n[testenv:list]\n```\n\nthen the following would match:\n\n```shell\n$ tox -f py37,lint -l\npy37-django20\nlint\n```\n\nfactors are always superseded by a given `toxenv`. for example, tox-factor would\nnoop in the following cases:\n\n```shell\n$ tox -f py37 -e py35-django21 -l\npy35-django21\n\n$ toxenv=py35-django21 tox -f py37 -l\npy35-django21\n```\n\nfactors do not support partial matching. `tox -f py3` would not match `py37`.\nhowever, factors may match disparate dash-separated parts. given the following:\n```ini\n[tox]\nenvlist =\n    py{35,36,37}-django{20,21,22}-{redis,memcached}\n```\n\nthen `tox -f py37-redis` would match:\n```\npy37-django20-redis\npy37-django21-redis\npy37-django22-redis\n```\n\n\n## release process\n\n- update changelog\n- update package version in setup.py\n- create git tag for version\n- upload release to pypi test server\n- upload release to official pypi server\n\n```shell\n$ pip install -u pip setuptools wheel twine\n$ rm -rf dist/ build/\n$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n$ twine upload -r test dist/*\n$ twine upload dist/*\n```\n\n\n## thanks\n\nthis code is largely based off the work done by @ryanhiebert in [tox-travis][1].\nwithout his efforts, it would have taken significantly more time to write and\ntest this package.\n\n## license\n\nsee: [license][2]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-travis\n[2]:
