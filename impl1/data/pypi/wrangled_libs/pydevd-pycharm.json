  "description": "pydev.debugger\n==============\n\nthe sources for the pydev.debugger (used in pydev & pycharm) may be seen at:\n\nhttps://github.com/fabioz/pydev.debugger\n\nin general, the debugger backend should **not** be installed separately if you're using an ide which already\nbundles it (such as pydev or pycharm).\n\nit is however available in pypi so that it can be installed for doing remote debugging with `pip` -- so, when\ndebugging a process which runs in another machine, it's possible to `pip install pydevd-pycharm` and in the code use\n`pydevd_pycharm.settrace(host='10.1.1.1')` to connect the debugger backend to the debugger ui running in the ide\n(whereas previously the sources had to be manually copied from the ide installation).\n\nit should be compatible with python 2.6 onwards (as well as jython 2.7, ironpython and pypy -- and\nany other variant which properly supports the python structure for debuggers -- i.e.: sys.settrace/threading.settrace).\n\nrecent versions contain speedup modules using cython, which are generated with a few changes in the regular files\nto `cythonize` the files. to update and compile the cython sources (and generate some other auto-generated files),\n`build_tools/build.py` should be run -- note that the resulting .pyx and .c files should be commited.\n\nto generate a distribution with the precompiled binaries for the ide, `build_binaries_windows.py` should be run (\nnote that the environments must be pre-created as specified in that file).\n\nto generate a distribution to upload to pypi, `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` should be run for each python version\nwhich should have a wheel and afterwards `twine upload -s dist/pydevd-*` should be run to actually upload the contents\nto pypi.\n\ntravis (linux ci):\n\n.. |travis| image:: https://travis-ci.org/fabioz/pydev.debugger.png\n  :target: https://travis-ci.org/fabioz/pydev.debugger\n\n|travis|\n\nappveyor (windows ci):\n\n.. |appveyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/j6vjq687brbk20ux?svg=true\n  :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fabioz/pydev-debugger\n\n|appveyor|",
