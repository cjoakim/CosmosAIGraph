  "description": "textfsm\n=======\n\npython module which implements a template based state machine for parsing\nsemi-formatted text. originally developed to allow programmatic access to\ninformation returned from the command line interface (cli) of networking\ndevices.\n\nthe engine takes two inputs - a template file, and text input (such as command\nresponses from the cli of a device) and returns a list of records that contains\nthe data parsed from the text.\n\na template file is needed for each uniquely structured text input. some examples\nare provided with the code and users are encouraged to develop their own.\n\nby developing a pool of template files, scripts can call textfsm to parse useful\ninformation from a variety of sources. it is also possible to use different\ntemplates on the same data in order to create different tables (or views).\n\ntextfsm was developed internally at google and released under the apache 2.0\nlicence for the benefit of the wider community.\n\n[**see documentation for more details.**](https://github.com/google/textfsm/wiki/textfsm)\n\nbefore contributing\n-------------------\nif you are not a google employee, our lawyers insist that you sign a contributor\nlicence agreement (cla).\n\nif you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own\nthe intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an\n[individual cla](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual).\nindividual clas can be signed electronically. if you work for a company that\nwants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a\n[corporate cla](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).\nthe google cla is based on apache's. note that unlike some projects\n(notably gnu projects), we do not require a transfer of copyright. you still own\nthe patch.\n\nsadly, even the smallest patch needs a cla.",
