  "description": "python docs sphinx theme\n=========================\n\nthis is the theme for the python documentation.\n\nnote that when adopting this theme, you're also borrowing an element of the\ntrust and credibility established by the cpython core developers over the\nyears. that's fine, and you're welcome to do so for other python community\nprojects if you so choose, but please keep in mind that in doing so you're also\nchoosing to accept some of the responsibility for maintaining that collective\ntrust.\n\nto use the theme, install it into your docs build environment via ``pip`` \n(preferably in a virtual environment).\n\n\nconfiguration options\n---------------------\n\nto use this theme, add the following to ``conf.py``:\n\n- ``html_theme = 'python_docs_theme'``\n\n- ``html_sidebars``, defaults taken from http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/config.html#confval-html_sidebars\n\n",
