  "description": "ruyaml\n======\n\n``ruyaml`` package is a fork of ``ruamel.yaml`` aimed to made in order to\nsecure the future of the library, mainly by having a pool of maintainers.\n\nnotes\n=====\n\n- the current version has the same api as the \"ruamel.yaml\" package.\n  however, it will install the `ruyaml` python module. thus, simply\n  replace ``from ruamel import yaml`` with ``import ruyaml as yaml``\n  (or equivalent) and you're all set.\n- python3.6 is the minimal version of python supported\n\n\n:version:       0.90.1\n:updated:       2021-06-10\n:documentation: http://ruyaml.readthedocs.io\n:repository:    https://github.com/pycontribs/ruyaml.git\n:pypi:          https://pypi.org/project/ruyaml/\n\n*the 0.16.13 release was the last that was tested to be working on python 2.7.\nthe 0.17 series will still be tested on python 3.5, but the 0.18 will not. the\n0.17 series will also stop support for the old pyyaml functions, so a `yaml()` instance\nwill need to be created.*\n\n*the 0.17 series will also see changes in how comments are attached during\nroundtrip. this will result in backwards incompatibilities on the `.ca` data and\nit might even be necessary for documented methods that handle comments.*\n\n*please adjust your dependencies accordingly if necessary. (`ruamel.yaml<0.17`)*\n\n\nstarting with version 0.15.0 the way yaml files are loaded and dumped\nhas been changing, see the api doc for details.  currently existing\nfunctionality will throw a warning before being changed/removed.\n**for production systems already using a pre 0.16 version, you should\npin the version being used with ``ruamel.yaml<=0.15``** if you cannot\nfully test upgrading to a newer version. for new usage\npin to the minor version tested ( ``ruamel.yaml<=0.17``) or even to the\nexact version used.\n\nnew functionality is usually only available via the new api, so\nmake sure you use it and stop using the `ruamel.yaml.safe_load()`,\n`ruamel.yaml.round_trip_load()` and `ruamel.yaml.load()` functions\n(and their `....dump()` counterparts).\n\nif your package uses ``ruamel.yaml`` and is not listed on pypi, drop\nme an email, preferably with some information on how you use the\npackage (or a link to the repository) and i'll keep you informed\nwhen the status of the api is stable enough to make the transition.\n\n* `overview <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html>`_\n* `installing <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`_\n* `basic usage <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basicuse.html>`_\n* `details <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/detail.html>`_\n* `examples <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example.html>`_\n* `api <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html>`_\n* `differences with pyyaml <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pyyaml.html>`_\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/yaml/badge/?version=stable\n   :target: https://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/stable\n\n.. image:: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1128/badge\n   :target: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1128\n\n.. image:: https://sourceforge.net/p/ruamel-yaml/code/ci/default/tree/_doc/_static/license.svg?format=raw\n   :target: https://opensource.org/licenses/mit\n\n.. image:: https://sourceforge.net/p/ruamel-yaml/code/ci/default/tree/_doc/_static/pypi.svg?format=raw\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/\n\n.. image:: https://sourceforge.net/p/oitnb/code/ci/default/tree/_doc/_static/oitnb.svg?format=raw\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/oitnb/\n\n.. image:: http://www.mypy-lang.org/static/mypy_badge.svg\n   :target: http://mypy-lang.org/\n\nchangelog\n=========\n\n.. should insert next: at the beginning of line for next key (with empty line)\n\n0.17.17 (2021-10-31):\n  - extract timestamp matching/creation to util\n\n0.17.16 (2021-08-28):\n  - 398 also handle issue 397 when comment is newline\n\n0.17.15 (2021-08-28):\n  - fix issue 397, insert comment before key when a comment between key and value exists\n    (reported by `bastien gerard <https://sourceforge.net/u/bagerard/>`__)\n\n0.17.14 (2021-08-25):\n  - fix issue 396, inserting key/val in merged-in dictionary (reported by `bastien gerard\n    <https://sourceforge.net/u/bagerard/>`__)\n\n0.17.13 (2021-08-21):\n  - minor fix in attr handling\n\n0.17.12 (2021-08-21):\n  - fix issue with anchor on registered class not preserved and those classes using package\n    attrs with `@attr.s()` (both reported by `ssph <https://sourceforge.net/u/sph/>`__)\n\n0.17.11 (2021-08-19):\n  - fix error baseclass for ``duplicatekeyerorr`` (reported by `\u0142ukasz rogalski\n    <https://sourceforge.net/u/lrogalski/>`__)\n  - fix typo in reader error message, causing `keyerror` during reader error\n    (reported by `mtu <https://sourceforge.net/u/mtu/>`__)\n\n0.17.10 (2021-06-24):\n  - fix issue 388, token with old comment structure != two elements\n    (reported by `dimitrios bariamis <https://sourceforge.net/u/dbdbc/>`__)\n\n0.17.9 (2021-06-10):\n  - fix issue with updating commentedmap (reported by sri on\n    `stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/q/67911659/1307905>`__)\n\n0.17.8 (2021-06-09):\n  - fix for issue 387 where templated anchors on tagged object did get set\n    resulting in potential id reuse.
