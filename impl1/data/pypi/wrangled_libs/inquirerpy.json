[inquirerpy.readthedocs.io](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/)\n\n<!-- start intro -->\n\n## introduction\n\n`inquirerpy` is a python port of the famous [inquirer.js](https://github.com/sboudrias/inquirer.js/) (a collection of common interactive command line user interfaces).\nthis project is a re-implementation of the [pyinquirer](https://github.com/citguru/pyinquirer) project, with bug fixes of known issues, new prompts, backward compatible apis\nas well as more customisation options.\n\n<!-- end intro -->\n\n![demo](https://github.com/kazhala/gif/blob/master/inquirerpy-demo.gif)\n\n## motivation\n\n[pyinquirer](https://github.com/citguru/pyinquirer) is a great python port of [inquirer.js](https://github.com/sboudrias/inquirer.js/), however, the project is slowly reaching\nto an unmaintained state with various issues left behind and no intention to implement more feature requests. i was heavily relying on this library for other projects but\ncould not proceed due to the limitations.\n\nsome noticeable ones that bother me the most:\n\n- hard limit on `prompt_toolkit` version 1.0.3\n- various color issues\n- various cursor issues\n- no options for vi/emacs navigation key bindings\n- pagination option doesn't work\n\nthis project uses python3.7+ type hinting with focus on resolving above issues while providing greater customisation options.\n\n## requirements\n\n### os\n\nleveraging [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit), `inquirerpy` works cross platform for all os. although unix platform may have a better experience than windows.\n\n### python\n\n```\npython >= 3.7\n```\n\n## getting started\n\ncheckout full documentation **[here](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/)**.\n\n### install\n\n```sh\npip3 install inquirerpy\n```\n\n### quick start\n\n#### classic syntax (pyinquirer)\n\n```python\nfrom inquirerpy import prompt\n\nquestions = [\n    {\"type\": \"input\", \"message\": \"what's your name:\", \"name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"type\": \"confirm\", \"message\": \"confirm?\", \"name\": \"confirm\"},\n]\nresult = prompt(questions)\nname = result[\"name\"]\nconfirm = result[\"confirm\"]\n```\n\n#### alternate syntax\n\n```python\nfrom inquirerpy import inquirer\n\nname = inquirer.text(message=\"what's your name:\").execute()\nconfirm = inquirer.confirm(message=\"confirm?\").execute()\n```\n\n<!-- start migration -->\n\n## migrating from pyinquirer\n\nmost apis from [pyinquirer](https://github.com/citguru/pyinquirer) should be compatible with `inquirerpy`. if you have discovered more incompatible apis, please\ncreate an issue or directly update readme via a pull request.\n\n### editorprompt\n\n`inquirerpy` does not support [editor](https://github.com/citguru/pyinquirer#editor---type-editor) prompt as of now.\n\n### checkboxprompt\n\nthe following table contains the mapping of incompatible parameters.\n\n| pyinquirer      | inquirerpy      |\n| --------------- | --------------- |\n| pointer_sign    | pointer         |\n| selected_sign   | enabled_symbol  |\n| unselected_sign | disabled_symbol |\n\n### style\n\nevery style keys from [pyinquirer](https://github.com/citguru/pyinquirer) is present in `inquirerpy` except the ones in the following table.\n\n| pyinquirer | inquirerpy |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| selected   | pointer    |\n\nalthough `inquirerpy` support all the keys from [pyinquirer](https://github.com/citguru/pyinquirer), the styling works slightly different.\nplease refer to the [style](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/style.html) documentation for detailed information.\n\n<!-- end migration -->\n\n## similar projects\n\n### questionary\n\n[questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) is a fantastic fork which supports `prompt_toolkit` 3.0.0+ with performance improvement and more customisation options.\nit's already a well established and stable library.\n\ncomparing with [questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary), `inquirerpy` offers even more customisation options in styles, ui as well as key bindings. `inquirerpy` also provides a new\nand powerful [fuzzy](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/prompts/fuzzy.html) prompt.\n\n### python-inquirer\n\n[python-inquirer](https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer) is another great python port of [inquirer.js](https://github.com/sboudrias/inquirer.js/). instead of using `prompt_toolkit`, it\nleverages the library `blessed` to implement the ui.\n\nbefore implementing `inquirerpy`, this library came up as an alternative. it's a more stable library comparing to the original [pyinquirer](https://github.com/citguru/pyinquirer), however\nit has a rather limited customisation options and an older ui which did not solve the issues i was facing described in the [motivation](#motivation) section.\n\ncomparing with [python-inquirer](https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer), `inquirerpy` offers a slightly better ui,\nmore customisation options in key bindings and styles, providing pagination as well as more prompts.\n\n## credit\n\nthis project is based on the great work done by the following projects & their authors.\n\n- [pyinquirer](https://github.com/citguru/pyinquirer)\n- [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit)\n\n## license\n\nthis project
