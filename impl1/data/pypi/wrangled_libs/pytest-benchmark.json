  "description": "========\noverview\n========\n\n\n\na ``pytest`` fixture for benchmarking code. it will group the tests into rounds that are calibrated to the chosen\ntimer.\n\nsee calibration_ and faq_.\n\n* free software: bsd 2-clause license\n\ninstallation\n============\n\n::\n\n    pip install pytest-benchmark\n\ndocumentation\n=============\n\nfor latest release: `pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.org/en/stable <http://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_.\n\nfor master branch (may include documentation fixes): `pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest <http://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nexamples\n========\n\nbut first, a prologue:\n\n    this plugin tightly integrates into pytest. to use this effectively you should know a thing or two about pytest first.\n    take a look at the `introductory material <http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html>`_\n    or watch `talks <http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/talks.html>`_.\n\n    few notes:\n\n    * this plugin benchmarks functions and only that. if you want to measure block of code\n      or whole programs you will need to write a wrapper function.\n    * in a test you can only benchmark one function. if you want to benchmark many functions write more tests or\n      use `parametrization <http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/parametrize.html>`_.\n    * to run the benchmarks you simply use `pytest` to run your \"tests\". the plugin will automatically do the\n      benchmarking and generate a result table. run ``pytest --help`` for more details.\n\nthis plugin provides a `benchmark` fixture. this fixture is a callable object that will benchmark any function passed\nto it.\n\nexample:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def something(duration=0.000001):\n        \"\"\"\n        function that needs some serious benchmarking.\n        \"\"\"\n        time.sleep(duration)\n        # you may return anything you want, like the result of a computation\n        return 123\n\n    def test_my_stuff(benchmark):\n        # benchmark something\n        result = benchmark(something)\n\n        # extra code, to verify that the run completed correctly.\n        # sometimes you may want to check the result, fast functions\n        # are no good if they return incorrect results :-)\n        assert result == 123\n\nyou can also pass extra arguments:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def test_my_stuff(benchmark):\n        benchmark(time.sleep, 0.02)\n\nor even keyword arguments:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def test_my_stuff(benchmark):\n        benchmark(time.sleep, duration=0.02)\n\nanother pattern seen in the wild, that is not recommended for micro-benchmarks (very fast code) but may be convenient:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def test_my_stuff(benchmark):\n        @benchmark\n        def something():  # unnecessary function call\n            time.sleep(0.000001)\n\na better way is to just benchmark the final function:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def test_my_stuff(benchmark):\n        benchmark(time.sleep, 0.000001)  # way more accurate results!\n\nif you need to do fine control over how the benchmark is run (like a `setup` function, exact control of `iterations` and\n`rounds`) there's a special mode - pedantic_:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def my_special_setup():\n        ...\n\n    def test_with_setup(benchmark):\n        benchmark.pedantic(something, setup=my_special_setup, args=(1, 2, 3), kwargs={'foo': 'bar'}, iterations=10, rounds=100)\n\nscreenshots\n-----------\n\nnormal run:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/raw/master/docs/screenshot.png\n    :alt:

switched ci to github actions.\n* removed dependency on the ``py`` library (that was not properly specified as a dependency anyway).\n* fix skipping test in `test_utils.py` if appropriate vcs not available. also fix typo.\n  contributed by sam james in `#211 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/211>`_.\n* added support for pytest 7.2.0 by using ``pytest.hookimpl`` and ``pytest.hookspec`` to configure hooks.\n  contributed by florian bruhin in `#224 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/224>`_.\n* now no save is attempted if ``--benchmark-disable`` is used.\n  fixes `#205 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/issues/205>`_.\n  contributed by friedrich delgado in `#207 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/207>`_.\n\n3.4.1 (2021-04-17)\n------------------\n\n* republished with updated changelog.\n\n  i intended to publish a ``3.3.0`` release but i messed it up because bumpversion doesn't work well with pre-commit\n  apparently... thus ``3.4.0`` was set in by accident.\n\n\n3.4.0 (2021-04-17)\n------------------\n\n* disable progress indication unless ``--benchmark-verbose`` is used.\n  contributed by dimitris rozakis in `#149 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/149>`_.\n* added python 3.9, dropped python 3.5.\n  contributed by miroslav \u0161ediv\u00fd in `#189 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/189>`_.\n* changed the \"cpu\" data in the json output to include everything that cpuinfo outputs, for better or worse as cpuinfo 6.0 changed some\n  fields. users should now ensure they are an adequate cpuinfo package installed.\n  **may be backwards incompatible**\n* changed behavior of ``--benchmark-skip`` and ``--benchmark-only`` to apply early in the collection phase.\n  this means skipped tests won't make pytest run fixtures for said tests unnecessarily, but unfortunately this also means\n  the skipping behavior will be applied to any tests that requires a \"benchmark\" fixture, regardless if it would come from pytest-benchmark\n  or not.\n  **may be backwards incompatible**\n* added ``--benchmark-quiet`` - option to disable reporting and other information output.\n* squelched unnecessary warning when ``--benchmark-disable`` and save options are used.\n  fixes `#199 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/issues/199>`_.\n* ``performanceregression`` exception no longer inherits ``pytest.usageerror`` (apparently a *final* class).\n\n3.2.3 (2020-01-10)\n------------------\n\n* fixed \"already-imported\" pytest warning. contributed by jonathan simon prates in\n  `#151 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/151>`_.\n* fixed breakage that occurs when benchmark is disabled while using cprofile feature (by disabling cprofile too).\n* dropped python 3.4 from the test suite and updated test deps.\n* fixed ``pytest_benchmark.utils.clonefunc`` to work on python 3.8.\n\n3.2.2 (2017-01-12)\n------------------\n\n* added support for pytest items without funcargs. fixes interoperability with other pytest plugins like pytest-flake8.\n\n3.2.1 (2017-01-10)\n------------------\n\n* updated changelog entries for 3.2.0. i made the release for pytest-cov on the same day and thought i updated the\n  changelogs for both plugins. alas, i only updated pytest-cov.\n* added missing version constraint change. now pytest >= 3.8 is required (due to pytest 4.1 support).\n* fixed couple ci/test issues.\n* fixed broken ``pytest_benchmark.__version__``.\n\n3.2.0 (2017-01-07)\n------------------\n\n* added support for simple ``trial`` x-axis histogram label. contributed by ken crowell in\n  `#95 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/95>`_).\n* added support for pytest 3.3+, contributed by julien nicoulaud in\n  `#103 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/103>`_.\n* added support for pytest 4.0. contributed by pablo aguiar in\n  `#129 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/129>`_ and\n  `#130 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/130>`_.\n* added support for pytest 4.1.\n* various formatting, spelling and documentation fixes. contributed by\n  ken crowell, ofek lev, matthew feickert, jose eduardo, anton lodder, alexander duryagin and grygorii iermolenko in\n  `#97 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/97>`_,\n  `#105 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/105>`_,\n  `#110

fixed broken ``pytest_benchmark_update_machine_info`` hook. contributed by alex ford in\n  `#109 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/109>`_.\n* fixed bogus xdist warning when using ``--benchmark-disable``. contributed by francesco ballarin in\n  `#113 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/113>`_.\n* added support for pathlib2. contributed by lincoln de sousa in\n  `#114 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/114>`_.\n* changed handling so you can use ``--benchmark-skip`` and ``--benchmark-only``, with the later having priority.\n  contributed by ofek lev in\n  `#116 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/116>`_.\n* fixed various ci/testing issues.\n  contributed by stanislav levin in\n  `#134

<https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/138>`_.\n\n3.1.1 (2017-07-26)\n------------------\n\n* fixed loading data from old json files (missing ``ops`` field, see\n  `#81 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/issues/81>`_).\n* fixed regression on broken scm (see\n  `#82 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/issues/82>`_).\n\n3.1.0 (2017-07-21)\n------------------\n\n* added \"operations per second\" (``ops`` field in ``stats``) metric --\n  shows the call rate of code being tested. contributed by alexey popravka in\n  `#78 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/78>`_.\n* added a ``time`` field in ``commit_info``. contributed by \"varac\" in\n  `#71 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/71>`_.\n* added a ``author_time`` field in ``commit_info``. contributed by \"varac\" in\n  `#75   <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/75>`_.\n* fixed the leaking of credentials by masking the url printed when storing\n  data to elasticsearch.\n* added a ``--benchmark-netrc`` option to use credentials from a netrc file when\n  storing data to elasticsearch. both contributed by andre bianchi in\n  `#73 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/73>`_.\n* fixed docs on hooks. contributed by andre bianchi in `#74 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/74>`_.\n* remove ``git`` and ``hg`` as system dependencies when guessing the project name.\n\n3.1.0a2 (2017-03-27)\n--------------------\n\n* ``machine_info`` now contains more detailed information about the cpu, in\n  particular the exact model. contributed by antonio cuni in `#61 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/61>`_.\n* added ``benchmark.extra_info``, which you can use to save arbitrary stuff in\n  the json. contributed by antonio cuni in the same pr as above.\n* fix support for latest pygal version (histograms). contributed by swen kooij in\n  `#68 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/68>`_.\n* added support for getting ``commit_info`` when not running in the root of the repository. contributed by vara canero in\n  `#69 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/69>`_.\n* added short form for ``--storage``/``--verbose`` options in cli.\n* added an alternate ``pytest-benchmark`` cli bin (in addition to ``py.test-benchmark``) to match the madness in pytest.\n* fix some issues with ``--help`` in cli.\n* improved git remote parsing (for ``commit_info`` in json outputs).\n* fixed default value for ``--benchmark-columns``.\n* fixed comparison mode (loading was done too late).\n* remove the project name from the autosave name. this will get the old brief naming from 3.0 back.\n\n3.1.0a1 (2016-10-29)\n--------------------\n\n* added ``--benchmark-colums`` command line option. it selects what columns are displayed in the result table. contributed by\n  antonio cuni in `#34 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/34>`_.\n* added support for grouping by specific test parametrization (``--benchmark-group-by=param:name`` where ``name`` is your\n  param name). contributed by antonio cuni in `#37 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/37>`__.\n* added support for ``name`` or ``fullname`` in ``--benchmark-sort``.\n  contributed by antonio cuni in `#37 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/37>`_.\n* changed signature for ``pytest_benchmark_generate_json`` hook to take 2 new arguments: ``machine_info`` and ``commit_info``.\n* changed ``--benchmark-histogram`` to plot groups instead of name-matching runs.\n* changed ``--benchmark-histogram`` to plot exactly what you compared against. now it's ``1:1`` with the compare feature.\n* changed ``--benchmark-compare`` to allow globs. you can compare against all the previous runs now.\n* changed ``--benchmark-group-by`` to allow multiple values separated by comma.\n  example: ``--benchmark-group-by=param:foo,param:bar``\n* added a command line tool to compare previous data: ``py.test-benchmark``. it has two commands:\n\n  * ``list`` - lists all the available files.\n  * ``compare`` - displays result tables. takes options:\n\n    * ``--sort=col``\n    * ``--group-by=label``\n    * ``--columns=labels``\n    * ``--histogram=[filename-prefix]``\n* added ``--benchmark-cprofile`` that profiles last run of benchmarked function.  contributed by petr \u0161ebek.\n* changed ``--benchmark-storage`` so it now allows elasticsearch storage. it allows to store data to elasticsearch instead to\n  json files. contributed by petr \u0161ebek in `#58 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/58>`_.\n\n3.0.0 (2015-11-08)\n------------------\n\n* improved ``--help`` text for ``--benchmark-histogram``, ``--benchmark-save`` and ``--benchmark-autosave``.\n* benchmarks that raised exceptions during test now have special highlighting in result table (red background).\n* benchmarks that raised exceptions are not included in the saved data anymore (you can still get the old behavior back\n  by implementing ``pytest_benchmark_generate_json`` in your ``conftest.py``).\n* the plugin will use pytest's warning system for warnings. there are 2 categories: ``wbenchmark-c`` (compare mode\n  issues) and ``wbenchmark-u`` (usage issues).\n* the red warnings are only shown if ``--benchmark-verbose`` is used. they still will be always be shown in the\n  pytest-warnings section.\n* using the benchmark fixture more than one time is disallowed (will raise exception).\n* not using the benchmark fixture (but requiring it) will issue a warning (``wbenchmark-u1``).\n\n3.0.0rc1 (2015-10-25)\n---------------------\n\n* changed ``--benchmark-warmup`` to take optional value and automatically activate on pypy (default value is ``auto``).\n  **may be backwards incompatible**\n* removed the version check in compare mode (previously there was a warning if current version is lower than what's in\n  the file).\n\n3.0.0b3 (2015-10-22)\n---------------------\n\n* changed how comparison is displayed in the result table. now previous runs are shown as normal runs and names get a\n  special suffix indicating the origin. eg: \"test_foobar (now)\" or \"test_foobar (0123)\".\n* fixed sorting in the result table. now rows are sorted by the sort column, and then by name.\n* show the plugin version in the header section.\n* moved the display of default options in the header section.\n\n3.0.0b2 (2015-10-17)\n---------------------\n\n* add a ``--benchmark-disable`` option. it's automatically activated when xdist is on\n* when xdist is on or ``statistics`` can't be imported then ``--benchmark-disable`` is automatically activated (instead\n  of ``--benchmark-skip``). **backwards incompatible**\n* replace the deprecated ``__multicall__`` with the new hookwrapper system.\n* improved description for ``--benchmark-max-time``.\n\n3.0.0b1 (2015-10-13)\n--------------------\n\n* tests are sorted alphabetically in the results table.\n* failing to import ``statistics`` doesn't create hard failures anymore. benchmarks are automatically skipped if import\n  failure occurs. this would happen on python 3.2 (or earlier python 3).\n\n3.0.0a4 (2015-10-08)\n--------------------\n\n* changed how failures to get commit info are handled: now they are soft failures. previously it made the whole\n  test suite fail, just because you didn't have ``git/hg`` installed.\n\n3.0.0a3 (2015-10-02)\n--------------------\n\n* added progress indication when computing stats.\n\n3.0.0a2 (2015-09-30)\n--------------------\n\n* fixed accidental output capturing caused by capturemanager misuse.\n\n3.0.0a1 (2015-09-13)\n--------------------\n\n* added json report saving (the ``--benchmark-json`` command line arguments). based on initial work from dave collins in\n  `#8 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/8>`_.\n* added benchmark data storage(the ``--benchmark-save`` and ``--benchmark-autosave`` command line arguments).\n* added comparison to previous runs (the ``--benchmark-compare`` command line argument).\n* added performance regression checks (the ``--benchmark-compare-fail`` command line argument).\n* added possibility to group by various parts of test name (the ``--benchmark-compare-group-by`` command line argument).\n* added historical plotting (the ``--benchmark-histogram`` command line argument).\n* added option to fine tune the calibration (the ``--benchmark-calibration-precision`` command line argument and\n  ``calibration_precision`` marker option).\n\n* changed ``benchmark_weave`` to no longer be a context manager. cleanup is performed automatically.\n  **backwards incompatible**\n* added ``benchmark.weave`` method (alternative to ``benchmark_weave`` fixture).\n\n* added new hooks to allow customization:\n\n  * ``pytest_benchmark_generate_machine_info(config)``\n  * ``pytest_benchmark_update_machine_info(config, info)``\n  * ``pytest_benchmark_generate_commit_info(config)``\n  * ``pytest_benchmark_update_commit_info(config, info)``\n  * ``pytest_benchmark_group_stats(config, benchmarks, group_by)``\n  * ``pytest_benchmark_generate_json(config, benchmarks, include_data)``\n  * ``pytest_benchmark_update_json(config, benchmarks, output_json)``\n  * ``pytest_benchmark_compare_machine_info(config, benchmarksession, machine_info, compared_benchmark)``\n\n* changed the timing code to:\n\n  * tracers are automatically disabled when running the test function (like coverage tracers).\n  * fixed an issue with calibration code getting stuck.\n\n* added ``pedantic mode`` via ``benchmark.pedantic()``. this mode disables calibration and allows a setup function.\n\n\n2.5.0 (2015-06-20)\n------------------\n\n* improved test suite a bit (not using ``cram`` anymore).\n* improved help text on the ``--benchmark-warmup`` option.\n* made ``warmup_iterations`` available as a marker argument (eg: ``@pytest.mark.benchmark(warmup_iterations=1234)``).\n* fixed ``--benchmark-verbose``'s printouts to work properly with output capturing.\n* changed how warmup iterations are computed (now number of total iterations is used, instead of just the rounds).\n* fixed a bug where calibration would run forever.\n* disabled red/green coloring (it was kinda random) when there's a single test in the results table.\n\n2.4.1 (2015-03-16)\n------------------\n\n* fix regression, plugin was raising ``valueerror: no option named 'dist'`` when xdist wasn't installed.\n\n2.4.0 (2015-03-12)\n------------------\n\n* add a ``benchmark_weave`` experimental fixture.\n* fix internal failures when ``xdist`` plugin is active.\n* automatically disable benchmarks if ``xdist`` is active.\n\n2.3.0 (2014-12-27)\n------------------\n\n* moved the warmup in the calibration phase. solves issues with benchmarking on pypy.\n\n  added a ``--benchmark-warmup-iterations`` option to fine-tune that.\n\n2.2.0 (2014-12-26)\n------------------\n\n* make the default rounds smaller (so that variance is more accurate).\n* show the defaults in the ``--help`` section.\n\n2.1.0 (2014-12-20)\n------------------\n\n* simplify the calibration code so that the round is smaller.\n* add diagnostic output for calibration code (``--benchmark-verbose``).\n\n2.0.0 (2014-12-19)\n------------------\n\n* replace the context-manager based api with a simple callback interface. **backwards incompatible**\n* implement timer calibration for precise measurements.\n\n1.0.0 (2014-12-15)\n------------------\n\n* use a precise default timer for pypy.\n\n? (?)\n-----\n\n* readme and styling fixes. contributed by marc abramowitz in `#4 <https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/pull/4>`_.\n* lots of wild changes.\n\n\n",
