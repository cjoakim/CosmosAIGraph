  "description": "introduction\n------------\n\ngmpy2 is an optimized, c-coded python extension module that supports fast\nmultiple-precision arithmetic.  gmpy2 is based on the original gmpy module.\ngmpy2 adds support for correctly rounded multiple-precision real arithmetic\n(using the mpfr library) and complex arithmetic (using the mpc library).\n\nversion 2.1.x status\n--------------------\n\ngmpy2 2.1 was extensively refactored. some of the significant changes are:\n\n  * support for thread-safe contexts and context methods\n  * interoperability with cython extensions\n  * mpz and mpq operation can release the gil\n    * the current implementation is experimental\n  * improved argument processing\n\nthe gmpy2 2.1 series will be the last to offer compatibility with python 2.7.\nrelease 2.1.3 is the last planned release of the 2.1 series.\n\nnote: versions 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 were released to address apple silicon wheel\nbuild issues. there are no code changes.\n\nrelease 2.1.5 is the last planned release of the 2.1 series.\n\n\nversion 2.2 plans\n-----------------\n\nversion 2.2 will drop support for python 2.7 and older python 3.x versions.\n\nthe primary development focus will be on functions that operate on lists and\nrelease the gil. see powmod_base_list and powmod_exp_list as examples.\n\navailability\n------------\n\ngmpy2 is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2/\n\ndocumentation is available at https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\n\n",
