  "description": "# cog: containers for machine learning\n\ncog is an open-source tool that lets you package machine learning models in a standard, production-ready container.\n\nyou can deploy your packaged model to your own infrastructure, or to [replicate](https://replicate.com/).\n\n## highlights\n\n- \ud83d\udce6 **docker containers without the pain.** writing your own `dockerfile` can be a bewildering process. with cog, you define your environment with a [simple configuration file](#how-it-works) and it generates a docker image with all the best practices: nvidia base images, efficient caching of dependencies, installing specific python versions, sensible environment variable defaults, and so on.\n\n- \ud83e\udd2c\ufe0f **no more cuda hell.** cog knows which cuda/cudnn/pytorch/tensorflow/python combos are compatible and will set it all up correctly for you.\n\n- \u2705 **define the inputs and outputs for your model with standard python.** then, cog generates an openapi schema and validates the inputs and outputs with pydantic.\n\n- \ud83c\udf81 **automatic http prediction server**: your model's types are used to dynamically generate a restful http api using [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).\n\n- \ud83e\udd5e **automatic queue worker.** long-running deep learning models or batch processing is best architected with a queue. cog models do this out of the box. redis is currently supported, with more in the pipeline.\n\n- \u2601\ufe0f **cloud storage.** files can be read and written directly to amazon s3 and google cloud storage. (coming soon.)\n\n- \ud83d\ude80 **ready for production.** deploy your model anywhere that docker images run. your own infrastructure, or [replicate](https://replicate.com).\n\n## how it works\n\ndefine the docker environment your model runs in with `cog.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuild:\n  gpu: true\n  system_packages:\n    - \"libgl1-mesa-glx\"\n    - \"libglib2.0-0\"\n  python_version: \"3.11\"\n  python_packages:\n    - \"torch==1.8.1\"\npredict: \"predict.py:predictor\"\n```\n\ndefine how predictions are run on your model with `predict.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom cog import basepredictor, input, path\nimport torch\n\nclass predictor(basepredictor):\n    def setup(self):\n        \"\"\"load the model into memory to make running multiple predictions efficient\"\"\"\n        self.model = torch.load(\"./weights.pth\")\n\n    # the arguments and types the model takes as input\n    def predict(self,\n          image: path = input(description=\"grayscale input image\")\n    ) -> path:\n        \"\"\"run a single prediction on the model\"\"\"\n        processed_image = preprocess(image)\n        output = self.model(processed_image)\n        return postprocess(output)\n```\n\nnow, you can run predictions on this model:\n\n```console\n$ cog predict -i image=@input.jpg\n--> building docker image...\n--> running prediction...\n--> output written to output.jpg\n```\n\nor, build a docker image for deployment:\n\n```console\n$ cog build -t my-colorization-model\n--> building docker image...\n--> built my-colorization-model:latest\n\n$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --gpus all my-colorization-model\n\n$ curl http://localhost:5000/predictions -x post \\\n    -h 'content-type: application/json' \\\n    -d '{\"input\": {\"image\": \"https://.../input.jpg\"}}'\n```\n\n<!-- note (bfirsh): development environment instructions intentionally left out of readme for now, so as not to confuse the \"ship a model to production\" message.\n\nin development, you can also run arbitrary commands inside the docker environment:\n\n```console\n$ cog run python train.py\n...\n```\n\nor, [spin up a jupyter notebook](docs/notebooks.md):\n\n```console\n$ cog run -p 8888 jupyter notebook --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0\n```\n-->\n\n## why are we building this?\n\nit's really hard for researchers to ship machine learning models to production.\n\npart of the solution is docker, but it is so complex to get it to work: dockerfiles, pre-/post-processing, flask servers, cuda versions. more often than not the researcher has to sit down with an engineer to get the damn thing deployed.\n\n[andreas](https://github.com/andreasjansson) and [ben](https://github.com/bfirsh) created cog. andreas used to work at spotify, where he built tools for building and deploying ml models with docker. ben worked at docker, where he created [docker compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).\n\nwe realized that, in addition to spotify, other companies were also using docker to build and deploy machine learning models. [uber](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-pyml/) and others have built similar systems. so, we're making an open source version so other people can do this too.\n\nhit us up if you're interested in using it or want to collaborate with us. [we're on discord](https://discord.gg/replicate) or email us at [team@replicate.com](mailto:team@replicate.com).\n\n## prerequisites\n\n- **macos, linux or windows 11**. cog works on macos, linux and windows 11 with [wsl 2](docs/wsl2/wsl2.md)\n- **docker**. cog uses docker to create a container for your model. you'll need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before you can run cog.\n\n## install\n\n<a id=\"upgrade\"></a>\n\nif you're using macos, you can install cog using homebrew:\n\n```console\nbrew install cog\n```\n\nyou can also download and install the latest release of cog\ndirectly from github by running the following commands in a terminal:\n\n```console\nsudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/cog -l \"https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/latest/download/cog_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m)\"\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cog\n```\n\nalternatively, you can build cog from source and install it with these commands:\n\n```console\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n## next steps\n\n- [get started with an example model](docs/getting-started.md)\n- [get started with your own model](docs/getting-started-own-model.md)\n- [using cog with notebooks](docs/notebooks.md)\n- [using cog with windows 11](docs/wsl2/wsl2.md)\n- [take a look at some examples of using cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog-examples)\n- [deploy models with cog](docs/deploy.md)\n- [`cog.yaml` reference](docs/yaml.md) to learn how to define your model's environment\n- [prediction interface reference](docs/python.md) to learn how the `predictor` interface works\n- [http api reference](docs/http.md) to learn how to use the http api that models serve\n\n## need help?\n\n[join us in #cog on discord.](https://discord.gg/replicate)\n\n## contributors \u2728\n\nthanks goes to
