(\n  `#128 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/pull/128>`__).\n\n\n0.44 (2020-10-03)\n-----------------\n\n- try to avoid passing ``--recurse-submodules`` to ``git ls`` if the project\n  doesn't use git submodules (i.e. doesn't have a ``.gitsubmodules`` file).\n  this should make check-manifest work again with older git versions, as long\n  as you don't use submodules (`#124\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/124>`__).\n\n\n0.43 (2020-09-21)\n-----------------\n\n- fix collecting files versioned by ``git`` when a project has submodules and\n  ``git_index_file`` is set.  this bug was triggered when ``check-manifest``\n  was run as part of a git hook (\n  `#122 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/122>`__,\n  `#123 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/pull/123>`__).\n\nnote: check-manifest 0.43 requires ``git`` version 2.11 or later.\n\n\n0.42 (2020-05-03)\n-----------------\n\n- added ``-q``/``--quiet`` command line argument. this will reduce the verbosity\n  of informational output, e.g. for use in a ci pipeline.\n\n- rewrote the ignore logic to be more compatible with setuptools.  this might\n  have introduced some regressions, so please file bugs!  one side effect of\n  this is that ``--ignore`` (or the ``ignore`` setting in the config file)\n  is now handled the same way as ``global-exclude`` in a ``manifest.in``, which\n  means:\n\n  - it's matched anywhere in the file tree\n  - it's ignored if it matches a directory\n\n  you can ignore directories only by ignoring every file inside it. you\n  can use ``--ignore=dir/**`` to do that.\n\n  this decision is not cast in stone: i may in the future change the\n  handling of ``--ignore`` to match files and directories, because there's no\n  reason it has to be setuptools-compatible.\n\n- drop python 2.7 support.\n\n\n0.41 (2020-02-25)\n-----------------\n\n- support `pep 517`_, i.e. packages using pyproject.toml instead of a setup.py\n  (`#105 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/105>`_).\n\n.. _pep 517: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/\n\n- ignore subcommand stderr unless the subcommand fails.  this avoids treating\n  warning messages as filenames.  (`#110\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/110>`_.)\n\n\n0.40 (2019-10-15)\n-----------------\n\n- add python 3.8 support.\n\n\n0.39 (2019-06-06)\n-----------------\n\n- you can now use check-manifest as a `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_\n  hook (`#100 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/100>`__).\n\n\n0.38 (2019-04-23)\n-----------------\n\n- add python 3.7 support.\n\n- drop python 3.4 support.\n\n- added github templates to default ignore patterns.\n\n- added reading check-manifest config out of ``tox.ini`` or ``pyproject.toml``.\n\n\n0.37 (2018-04-12)\n-----------------\n\n- drop python 3.3 support.\n\n- support packages using ``setuptools_scm``\n  (`#68 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/68>`__).\n\n  note that ``setuptools_scm`` usually makes manifest.in files obsolete.\n  having one is helpful only if you intend to build an sdist and then use that\n  sdist to perform further builds, instead of building from a source checkout.\n\n\n0.36 (2017-11-21)\n-----------------\n\n- handle empty vcs repositories more gracefully\n  (`#84 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/84>`__).\n\n\n0.35 (2017-01-30)\n-----------------\n\n- python 3.6 support.\n\n\n0.34 (2016-09-14)\n-----------------\n\n- fix windowserror due to presence of read-only files\n  (`#74 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/74>`__).\n\n\n0.33 (2016-08-29)\n-----------------\n\n- fix windowserror due to git submodules in subdirectories\n  (`#73 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/pull/73>`__).\n  contributed by loren gordon.\n\n\n0.32 (2016-08-16)\n-----------------\n\n* new config/command line option to ignore bad ideas (ignore-bad-ideas)\n  (`issue #67 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/67>`__).\n  contributed by brecht machiels.\n\n* files named ``.hgsigs`` are ignored by default.  contributed by jakub wilk.\n\n\n0.31 (2016-01-28)\n-----------------\n\n- drop python 3.2 support.\n\n- ignore commented-out lines in manifest.in\n  (`issue #66 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/66>`__).\n\n\n0.30 (2015-12-10)\n-----------------\n\n* support git submodules\n  (`issue #61 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/61>`__).\n\n* revert the zc.buildout support hack from 0.26 because it causes breakage\n  (`issue #56 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/56>`__).\n\n* improve non-ascii filename handling with bazaar on windows.\n\n\n0.29 (2015-11-21)\n-----------------\n\n* fix --python with just a command name, to be found in path (`issue #57\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/57>`__).\n\n\n0.28 (2015-11-11)\n-----------------\n\n* fix detection of git repositories when .git is a file and not a directory (`#53\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/pull/53>`__).  one situation\n  where this occurs is when the project is checked out as a git submodule.\n\n* apply ignore patterns in subdirectories too (`#54\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/54>`__).\n\n\n0.27 (2015-11-02)\n-----------------\n\n* fix utter breakage on windows, introduced in 0.26 (`issue #52\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/52>`__).\n  (the bug -- clearing the environment unnecessarily -- could probably\n  also cause locale-related problems on other oses.)\n\n\n0.26 (2015-10-30)\n-----------------\n\n* do not complain about missing ``.gitattributes`` file (`pr #50\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/pull/50>`__).\n\n* normalize unicode representation and case of filenames. (`issue #47\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/47>`__).\n\n* support installation via zc.buildout better (`issue #35\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/35>`__).\n\n* drop python 2.6 support because one of our test dependencies (mock) dropped\n  it.  this also means we no longer use environment markers.\n\n\n0.25 (2015-05-27)\n-----------------\n\n* stop dynamic computation of install_requires in setup.py: this doesn't work\n  well in the presence of the pip 7 wheel cache.  use pep-426 environment\n  markers instead (this means we now require setuptools >= 0.7, and pip >= 6.0,\n  and wheel >= 0.24).\n\n\n0.24 (2015-03-26)\n-----------------\n\n* make sure ``setup.py`` not being added to the vcs doesn't cause\n  hard-to-understand errors (`issue #46\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/46>`__).\n\n\n0.23 (2015-02-12)\n-----------------\n\n* more reliable svn status parsing; now handles svn externals (`issue #45\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/45>`__).\n\n* the test suite now skips tests for version control systems that aren't\n  installed (`issue #42\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/42>`__).\n\n\n0.22 (2014-12-23)\n-----------------\n\n* more terse output by default; use the new ``-v`` (``--verbose``) flag\n  to see all the details.\n\n* warn the user if manifest.in is missing  (`issue #31\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/31>`__).\n\n* fix ioerror when files listed under version control are missing (`issue #32\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/32>`__).\n\n* improved wording of the match/do not match messages (`issue #34\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/34>`__).\n\n* handle a relative --python path (`issue #36\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/36>`__).\n\n* warn about leading and trailing slashes in manifest.in (`issue #37\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/37>`__).\n\n* ignore .travis.yml by default (`issue #39\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/39>`__).\n\n* suggest a rule for makefile found deeper in the source tree.\n\n\n0.21 (2014-06-13)\n-----------------\n\n* don't drop setup.cfg when copying version-controlled files into a clean\n  temporary directory (`issue #29\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/29>`__).\n\n\n0.20 (2014-05-14)\n-----------------\n\n* restore warning about files included in the sdist but not added to the\n  version control system (`issue #27\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/27>`__).\n\n* fix ``check-manifest relative/pathname`` (`issue #28\n  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/28>`__).\n\n\n0.19 (2014-02-09)\n-----------------\n\n* more correct manifest.in parsing for exclusion rules.\n* some effort was expended towards windows compatibility.\n* handles non-ascii filenames, as long as they're valid in your locale\n  (`issue #23 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/23>`__,\n  `#25 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/23>`__).\n\n\n0.18 (2014-01-30)\n-----------------\n\n* friendlier error message when an external command cannot be found\n  (`issue #21 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/21>`__).\n* add suggestion pattern for `.coveragerc`.\n* python 2.6 support\n  (`issue #22 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/22>`__).\n\n\n0.17 (2013-10-10)\n-----------------\n\n* read the existing manifest.in file for files to ignore\n  (`issue #19 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/19>`__).\n\n\n0.16 (2013-10-01)\n-----------------\n\n* fix subversion status parsing in the presence of svn usernames longer than 12\n  characters (`issue #18 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/18>`__).\n\n\n0.15 (2013-09-20)\n-----------------\n\n* normalize the paths of all files, avoiding some duplicate misses of\n  directories.  (`issue #16 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/16>`__).\n  [maurits]\n\n\n0.14 (2013-08-28)\n-----------------\n\n* supports packages that do not live in the root of a version control\n  repository (`issue #15 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/15>`__).\n\n* more reliable svn support: detect files that have been added but not\n  committed (or committed but not updated).\n\n* licence changed from gpl (v2 or later) to mit\n  (`issue #12 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/12>`__).\n\n\n0.13 (2013-07-31)\n-----------------\n\n* new command line option: --ignore\n  (`issue #11 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/11>`__).\n  contributed by steven myint.\n\n* new command line option: -p, --python.  defaults to the python you used to\n  run check-manifest.  fixes issues with packages that require python 3 to run\n  setup.py (`issue #13 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/13>`__).\n\n\n0.12 (2013-05-15)\n-----------------\n\n* add suggestion pattern for `makefile`.\n\n* more generic suggestion patterns, should cover almost anything.\n\n* zest.releaser_ integration: skip check-release for non-python packages\n  (`issue #9 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/9>`__).\n\n\n0.11 (2013-03-20)\n-----------------\n\n* make sure ``manifest.in`` is not ignored even if it hasn't been added to the\n  vcs yet (`issue #7 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/7>`__).\n\n\n0.10 (2013-03-17)\n-----------------\n\n* ``check-manifest --version`` now prints the version number.\n\n* don't apologize for not adding rules for directories (especially after adding\n  rules that include files inside that directory).\n\n* python 3 support contributed by steven myint.\n\n* default ignore patterns can be configured in ``setup.cfg``\n  (`issue #3 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/3>`_).\n\n\n0.9 (2013-03-06)\n----------------\n\n* add suggestion pattern for `.travis.yml`.\n\n* when check-manifest -u (or -c) doesn't know how to write a rule matching a\n  particular file, it now apologizes explicitly.\n\n* copy the source tree to a temporary directory before running python setup.py\n  sdist to avoid side effects from setuptools plugins or stale\n  \\*.egg-info/sources.txt files\n  (`issue #1 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/1>`_).\n\n* warn if `*.egg-info` or `*.mo` is actually checked into the vcs.\n\n* don't complain if `*.mo` files are present in the sdist but not in the vcs\n  (`issue #2 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/2>`_).\n\n\n0.8 (2013-03-06)\n----------------\n\n* entry point for zest.releaser_.  if you install both zest.releaser and\n  check-manifest, you will be asked if you want to check your manifest during\n  ``fullrelease``.\n\n.. _zest.releaser: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser\n\n\n0.7 (2013-03-05)\n----------------\n\n* first release available from the python package index.\n\n* moved from https://gist.github.com/4277075\n  to https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest\n\n* added readme.rst, changes.rst, setup.py, tox.ini (but no real tests yet),\n  manifest.in, and a makefile.\n\n* fixed a bug in error reporting (when setup.py failed, the user would get\n  `typeerror: descriptor '__init__' requires an 'exceptions.exception' object\n  but received a 'str'`).\n\n\n",
