  "description": "pudb: a console-based visual debugger for python\n================================================\n\n.. image:: https://gitlab.tiker.net/inducer/pudb/badges/main/pipeline.svg\n    :alt: gitlab build status\n    :target: https://gitlab.tiker.net/inducer/pudb/commits/main\n.. image:: https://github.com/inducer/pudb/workflows/ci/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push\n    :alt: github build status\n    :target: https://github.com/inducer/pudb/actions?query=branch%3amain+workflow%3aci+event%3apush\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/pudb.png\n    :alt: python package index release page\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/pudb/\n\nits goal is to provide all the niceties of modern gui-based debuggers in a\nmore lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. pudb allows you to debug code\nright where you write and test it--in a terminal.\n\nhere are some screenshots:\n\n* light theme\n\n  .. image:: doc/images/pudb-screenshot-light.png\n\n* dark theme\n\n  .. image:: doc/images/pudb-screenshot-dark.png\n\nyou may watch screencasts too:\n\n* `meet pudb, a debugger for python code (2020) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjykcwps_uu>`_\n\n* `pudb intro screencast (2009) <http://vimeo.com/5255125>`_\n\nfeatures\n--------\n\n* syntax-highlighted source, the stack, breakpoints and variables are all\n  visible at once and continuously updated. this helps you be more aware of\n  what's going on in your program. variable displays can be expanded, collapsed\n  and have various customization options.\n\n* pre-bundled themes, including dark themes via \"ctrl-p\". could set a custom theme also.\n\n* simple, keyboard-based navigation using single keystrokes makes debugging\n  quick and easy. pudb understands cursor-keys and vi shortcuts for navigation.\n  other keys are inspired by the corresponding pdb commands.\n\n* use search to find relevant source code, or use \"m\" to invoke the module\n  browser that shows loaded modules, lets you load new ones and reload existing\n  ones.\n\n* breakpoints can be set just by pointing at a source line and hitting \"b\" and\n  then edited visually in the breakpoints window.  or hit \"t\" to run to the line\n  under the cursor.\n\n* drop to a python shell in the current environment by pressing \"!\".\n  or open a command prompt alongside the source-code via \"ctrl-x\".\n\n* pudb places special emphasis on exception handling. a post-mortem mode makes\n  it easy to retrace a crashing program's last steps.\n\n* ability to control the debugger from a separate terminal.\n\n* ipython integration (see `wiki <http://wiki.tiker.net/pudb>`_)\n\n* should work with python 3.6 and newer. (versions 2019.2 and older continue\n  to support python 2.7.)\n\nlinks\n-----\n\n`pudb documentation <https://documen.tician.de/pudb>`_\n\npudb also has a `mailing list <http://lists.tiker.net/listinfo/pudb>`_ that\nyou may use to submit patches and requests for help.  you can also send a pull\nrequest to the `github repository <https://github.com/inducer/pudb>`_\n\ndevelopment version\n-------------------\n\nyou may obtain the development version using the `git <http://git-scm.org/>`_\nversion control tool.::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/inducer/pudb.git\n\nyou may also `browse the code <https://github.com/inducer/pudb>`_ online.\n",
