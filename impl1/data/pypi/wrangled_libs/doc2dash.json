  "description": "# doc2dash\n\n*doc2dash* is an extensible [documentation set](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/developertools/conceptual/documentation_sets/010-overview_of_documentation_sets/docset_overview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/tp40005266-ch13-sw6) (*docset*) generator that helps you to have documentation for all your favorite apis in [*dash.app*-compatible](https://kapeli.com/dash/) api browsers.\n\nan api browser is an application that runs locally on your computer and allows you to search various api docs by pressing a key combination and starting to type (i have bound it to alt-space bar and can't write code without it).\n\nthe most common ones \u2013 [*dash.app*](https://kapeli.com/dash) (macos) and [*zeal*](https://zealdocs.org) (windows and linux) \u2013 come with **many** docsets out of the box, but they can never offer you docsets for *every* package you'll ever use.\nthis is where *doc2dash* comes in:\nit takes your offline documentation and converts it into an indexed format that api browsers can read and search (very fast!).\n\ncurrently it supports all known *intersphinx*-based documentation systems like [*sphinx*](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), [*pydoctor*](https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor), or [*mkdocs*](https://www.mkdocs.org) (with [*mkdocstrings*](https://mkdocstrings.github.io)).\nwhile *doc2dash* is a python project, the support is **not** limited to python-related formats.\n\nit's also extendable: [**you** can write your own parser](https://doc2dash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/)!\n\n![doc2dash session](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hynek/doc2dash/main/docs/doc2dash-session.png)\n\n\n## project information\n\n- **license**: [mit](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/blob/main/license)\n- **pypi**: <https://pypi.org/project/doc2dash/>\n- **source code**: <https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash>\n- **documentation**: <https://doc2dash.rtfd.io/>\n- **changelog**: <https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/blob/main/changelog.md>\n- **supported python versions**: 3.8 and later (check the changelog for past releases that support _much_ older python versions)\n- **platforms**: pre-compiled **binaries** for **linux**, **macos**, and **windows** available; also runs on everything that runs python\n\n\n## release information for [3.0.0](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/compare/2.4.1...3.0.0) - 2022-09-13\n\n### removed\n\n- since *pydoctor* added support for *intersphinx* in version 21.2.0, the dedicated html-parsing parser has been removed. if you need to parse legacy *pydoctor* docs, please use *doc2dash* 2.4.1.\n\n\n### added\n\n- stand-alone binaries! if your platform is supported, you can now download binaries from the release page without dealing with python at all \u2013 courtesy of [*pyoxidizer*](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/).\n- *intersphinx*: documentation based on [*mkdocs*](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [*mkdocstrings*](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) metadata is now supported.\n- *intersphinx*: if no explicit name is passed, the docset name is derived von the documentation's metadata (and not the directory name, which is more often than not just `html`).\n- we use [*rich*](https://rich.readthedocs.io/) for output and progress bars now. this allows us more granular progress indication.\n- documentation on writing your own parser plugins.\n\n\n### changed\n\n- tons of refactorings that probably broke your custom parsers. sorry about that and let us know, if we can help you fixing them.\n- *intersphinx*: we now parse `objects.inv` files on our own. *sphinx* is not a dependency anymore.\n- *intersphinx*: files that are indexed by *intersphinx*, but don't exist aren't added to the docset anymore. common example is `py-modindex.html`. [#113](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/113) [#115](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/115)\n- we now check if the index page passed via `--index-page` / `-i` exists and fail if it doesn't.\n\n\n\n## credits\n\n*doc2dash* is written and maintained by hynek schlawack and released under the [mit license](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/blob/main/license).\n\nthe development is kindly supported by my employer [variomedia ag](https://www.variomedia.de/) and all my amazing [github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).\n\na full list of contributors can be found on [github's overview](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/graphs/contributors).\n",
