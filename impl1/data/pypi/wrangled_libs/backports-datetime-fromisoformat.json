  "description": "================================\nbackports.datetime_fromisoformat\n================================\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/movermeyer/backports.datetime_fromisoformat/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/movermeyer/backports.datetime_fromisoformat/actions/workflows/test.yml\n\na backport of python 3.11's ``datetime.fromisoformat`` methods to earlier versions of python 3.\ntested against python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11\n\ncurrent status\n--------------\n\ndevelopment of ``backports.datetime_fromisoformat`` is \"complete\". outside of potential minor bug fixes, do not expect new development here.\n\nversion 2 changes\n-----------------\n\nin version 1, ``backports.datetime_fromisoformat`` was a backport of the python 3.7 version of the ``fromisoformat`` methods.\nthis meant that it was limited in being able to parse only timestamps that were in the format produced by ``datetime.isoformat``.\n\nas of version 2, ``backports.datetime_fromisoformat`` is a backport of the python 3.11 version of the ``fromisoformat`` methods, which can parse (almost) the entire iso 8601 specification.\nthere are no changes required when upgrading from v1 to v2. the parser is simply able to parse a wider portion of the iso 8601 specification.\n\nhowever, starting in version 2, ``backports.datetime_fromisoformat`` will apply its changes to python < 3.11, whereas v1 only applied changes to python < 3.7.\nif you happened to be using ``backports.datetime_fromisoformat`` v1 on python 3.7 through python 3.10 and then upgrade to v2, it will patch the ``fromisoformat`` methods, whereas in v1 it did not.\nthe result is that the ``fromisoformat`` methods will suddenly be able to parse timestamps from a wider portion of the iso 8601 specification.\n\nquick start\n-----------\n\n**installation:**\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  pip install backports-datetime-fromisoformat\n\n**usage:**\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  >>> from datetime import date, datetime, time\n  >>> from backports.datetime_fromisoformat import monkeypatch\n  >>> monkeypatch.patch_fromisoformat()\n\n  >>> datetime.fromisoformat(\"2014-01-09t21:48:00-05:30\")\n  datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 9, 21, 48, tzinfo=-05:30)\n\n  >>> date.fromisoformat(\"2014-01-09\")\n  datetime.date(2014, 1, 9)\n\n  >>> time.fromisoformat(\"21:48:00-05:30\")\n  datetime.time(21, 48, tzinfo=-05:30)\n\nexplanation\n-----------\nin python 3.7, `datetime.fromisoformat`_ was added. it is the inverse of `datetime.isoformat`_.\nsimilar methods were added to the ``date`` and ``time`` types as well.\n\nin python 3.11, `datetime.fromisoformat`_ was extended to cover (almost) all of the iso 8601 specification, making it generally useful.\n\nfor those who need to support earlier versions of python, a backport of these methods was needed.\n\n.. _`datetime.fromisoformat`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromisoformat\n\n.. _`datetime.isoformat`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.isoformat\n\n``backports.datetime_fromisoformat`` is a c implementation of ``fromisoformat`` based on the upstream cpython 3.11 code.\nfor timezone objects, it uses a custom ``timezone`` c implementation (originally from `pendulum`_).\n\n.. _`pendulum`: https://pendulum.eustace.io/\n\nusage in python 3.11+\n---------------------\n\nnote: in python 3.11 and later, compatible versions of ``fromisoformat`` methods exist in the stdlib, and installing this package has no effect.\n\ngoal / project scope\n--------------------\n\nthe purpose of this project is to provide a perfect backport of the ``fromisoformat`` methods to earlier versions of python, while still providing comparable performance.\n",
