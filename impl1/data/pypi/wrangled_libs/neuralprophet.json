note that the project is still in beta phase. please report any issues you encounter or suggestions you have. we will do our best to address them quickly. contributions are very welcome!\n\n# neuralprophet: human-centered forecasting\nneuralprophet is an easy to learn framework for interpretable time series forecasting.\nneuralprophet is built on pytorch and combines neural network and traditional time-series algorithms, inspired by [facebook prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) and [ar-net](https://github.com/ourownstory/ar-net).\n- with few lines of code, you can define, customize, visualize, and evaluate your own forecasting models.\n- it is designed for iterative human-in-the-loop model building. that means that you can build a first model quickly, interpret the results, improve, repeat. due to the focus on interpretability and customization-ability, neuralprophet may not be the most accurate model out-of-the-box; so, don't hesitate to adjust and iterate until you like your results.\n- neuralprophet is best suited for time series data that is of higher-frequency (sub-daily) and longer duration (at least two full periods/years).\n\n\n## documentation\nthe [documentation page](https://neuralprophet.com) may not be entirely up to date. docstrings should be reliable, please refer to those when in doubt. we are working on an improved documentation. we appreciate any help to improve and update the docs.\n\nfor a visual introduction to neuralprophet, [view this presentation](notes/neuralprophet_introduction.pdf).\n\n## contribute\nwe compiled a [contributing to neuralprophet](contributing.md) page with practical instructions and further resources to help you become part of the family. \n\n## community\n#### discussion and help\nif you have any question or suggestion, you can participate with [our community right here on github](https://github.com/ourownstory/neural_prophet/discussions)\n\n#### slack chat\nwe also have an active [slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/neuralprophet/shared_invite/zt-sgme2rw3-3dch3yj_wgg01ixhoyaecg). come and join the conversation!\n\n## tutorials\n[![open all collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ourownstory/neural_prophet)\n\nthere are several [example notebooks](tutorials/) to help you get started. \n\nyou can find the datasets used in the tutorials, including data preprocessing examples, in our [neuralprophet-data repository](https://github.com/ourownstory/neuralprophet-data).\n\nplease refer to our [documentation page](https://neuralprophet.com) for more resources.\n\n### minimal example\n```python\nfrom neuralprophet import neuralprophet\n```\nafter importing the package, you can use neuralprophet in your code:\n```python\nm = neuralprophet()\nmetrics = m.fit(df)\nforecast = m.predict(df)\n```\nyou can visualize your results with the inbuilt plotting functions:\n```python\nfig_forecast = m.plot(forecast)\nfig_components = m.plot_components(forecast)\nfig_model = m.plot_parameters()\n```\nif you want to forecast into the unknown future, extend the dataframe before predicting:\n```python\nm = neuralprophet().fit(df, freq=\"d\")\ndf_future = m.make_future_dataframe(df, periods=30)\nforecast = m.predict(df_future)\nfig_forecast = m.plot(forecast)\n```\n## install\nyou can now install neuralprophet directly with pip:\n```shell\npip install neuralprophet\n```\n\n### install options\n\nif you plan to use the package in a jupyter notebook, we recommended to install the 'live' version:\n```shell\npip install neuralprophet[live]\n```\nthis will allow you to enable `plot_live_loss` in the `fit` function to get a live plot of train (and validation) loss.\n\nif you would like the most up to date version, you can instead install direclty from github:\n```shell\ngit clone <copied link from github>\ncd neural_prophet\npip install .\n```\n\n## features\n### model components\n* autoregression: autocorrelation modelling - linear or nn (ar-net)\n* trend: piecewise linear trend with optional automatic changepoint detection\n* seasonality: fourier terms at different periods such as yearly, daily, weekly, hourly.\n* lagged regressors: lagged observations (e.g temperature sensor) - linear or nn\n* future regressors: in advance known features (e.g. temperature forecast) - linear\n* events: country holidays & recurring custom events\n\n\n### framework features\n* multiple time series: fit a global/glocal model with (partially) shared model parameters\n* uncertainty: estimate values of specific quantiles - quantile regression\n* regularize modelling components\n* plotting of forecast components, model coefficients and more\n* time series crossvalidation utility\n* model checkpointing and validation\n\n\n### coming soon<sup>:tm:</sup>\n\n* cross-relation of lagged regressors\n* cross-relation and non-linear modelling of future regressors\n* static features / time series featurization\n* logistic growth for trend component.\n* model bias modelling / correction with secondary model\n* multimodal seasonality\n\nfor a list of past changes, please refer to the [releases page](https://github.com/ourownstory/neural_prophet/releases).\n\nthe vision for future development can be seen at [development timeline](notes/development_timeline.md) (partially outdated).\n\n## cite\nplease cite [neuralprophet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15397) in your publications if it helps your
