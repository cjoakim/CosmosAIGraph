  "description": "# orbax\n\n**orbax is no longer a standalone package, and should not be installed directly.**\n\n[orbax](https://orbax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a namespace providing common\nutility libraries for jax users.\n\nplease install [orbax-checkpoint](https://pypi.org/project/orbax-checkpoint) or\n[orbax-export](https://pypi.org/project/orbax-export) instead, for model\ncheckpointing and exporting utilities respectively. by default, installing\n`orbax` will install `orbax-checkpoint`.\n\n## support\n\ncontact orbax-dev@google.com for help or with any questions about orbax!\n\n### history\n\norbax was initially published as a catch-all package itself. in order to\nminimize dependency bloat for users, we have frozen that package at\n`orbax-0.1.9`, and will continue to release future changes under the\ndomain-specific utilities listed above (e.g. `orbax-checkpoint`).\n\nas we have preserved the orbax namespace, existing import statements can remain\nunchanged (e.g. `from orbax import checkpoint`).\n\n\n",
