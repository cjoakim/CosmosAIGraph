  "description": "neural structured learning (nsl) is a new learning paradigm to train neural\nnetworks by leveraging structured signals in addition to feature inputs.\nstructure can be explicit as represented by a graph or implicit as induced\nby adversarial perturbation.\n\nstructured signals are commonly used to represent relations or similarity\namong samples that may be labeled or unlabeled. leveraging these signals\nduring neural network training harnesses both labeled and unlabeled data,\nwhich can improve model accuracy, particularly when the amount of labeled\ndata is relatively small. additionally, models trained with samples that are\ngenerated by adversarial perturbation have been shown to be robust against\nmalicious attacks, which are designed to mislead a model's prediction or\nclassification.\n\nnsl generalizes to neural graph learning as well as to adversarial learning.\nthe nsl framework in tensorflow provides the following easy-to-use apis and\ntools for developers to train models with structured signals:\n\n* keras apis to enable training with graphs (explicit structure) and\n  adversarial perturbations (implicit structure).\n\n* tf ops and functions to enable training with structure when using\n  lower-level tensorflow apis.\n\n* tools to build graphs and construct graph inputs for training.\n\nthe nsl framework is designed to be flexible and can be used to train any\nkind of neural network. for example, feed-forward, convolution, and\nrecurrent neural networks can all be trained using the nsl framework. in\naddition to supervised and semi-supervised learning (a low amount of\nsupervision), nsl can in theory be generalized to unsupervised learning.\nincorporating structured signals is done only during training, so the\nperformance of the serving/inference workflow remains unchanged.\n\n",
