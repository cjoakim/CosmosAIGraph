requests.get() looks like this:\n    assert forge.repr_callable(requests.get) == 'get(url, params=none, **kwargs)'\n\n    # our get() calls the same code, but looks like this:\n    assert forge.repr_callable(get) == (\n        'get(url, params=none, data=none, headers=none, cookies=none, '\n            'files=none, auth=none, timeout=none, allow_redirects=true, '\n            'proxies=none, hooks=none, stream=none, verify=none, cert=none, '\n            'json=none'\n        ')'\n    )\n\nnext, we built a factory function ``with_method`` that creates new functions which make http requests with the proper http verb.\nbecause the ``method`` parameter is bound, it won't show up it is removed from the resulting functions signature.\nof course, the signature of these generated functions remains explicit, let's try it out:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    response = get('http://google.com')\n    assert 'feeling lucky' in response.text\n\nyou can review the alternate code (the actual implementation) by visiting the code for `requests.api <https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/991e8b76b7a9d21f698b24fa0058d3d5968721bc/requests/api.py>`_.\n\n.. example-end\n\n\n.. project-information-start\n\nproject information\n===================\n\n``forge`` is released under the `mit <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/>`_ license,\nits documentation lives at `read the docs <http://python-forge.rtfd.io/>`_,\nthe code on `github <https://github.com/dfee/forge>`_,\nand the latest release on `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/python-forge/>`_.\nit\u2019s rigorously tested on python 3.6+ and pypy 3.5+.\n\n``forge`` is authored by `devin fee <https://github.com/dfee>`_.\nother contributors are listed under https://github.com/dfee/forge/graphs/contributors.\n\n.. project-information-end\n\n\n.. _requests_api_get: https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/991e8b76b7a9d21f698b24fa0058d3d5968721bc/requests/api.py#l61\n\n\n",
