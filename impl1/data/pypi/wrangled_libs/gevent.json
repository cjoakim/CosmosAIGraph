the top-level\n  so it is limited to pure rest markup, not sphinx.\n\n\n\ngevent is a coroutine_ -based python_ networking library that uses\n`greenlet <https://greenlet.readthedocs.io>`_ to provide a high-level synchronous api on top of the `libev`_\nor `libuv`_ event loop.\n\nfeatures include:\n\n\n* fast event loop based on `libev`_ or `libuv`_.\n* lightweight execution units based on greenlets.\n* api that re-uses concepts from the python standard library (for\n  examples there are `events`_ and\n  `queues`_).\n* `cooperative sockets with ssl support <http://www.gevent.org/api/index.html#networking>`_\n* `cooperative dns queries <http://www.gevent.org/dns.html>`_ performed through a threadpool,\n  dnspython, or c-ares.\n* `monkey patching utility <http://www.gevent.org/intro.html#monkey-patching>`_ to get 3rd party modules to become cooperative\n* tcp/udp/http servers\n* subprocess support (through `gevent.subprocess`_)\n* thread pools\n\ngevent is `inspired by eventlet`_ but features a more consistent api,\nsimpler implementation and better performance. read why others `use\ngevent`_ and check out the list of the `open source projects based on\ngevent`_.\n\ngevent was written by `denis bilenko <http://denisbilenko.com/>`_.\n\nsince version 1.1, gevent is maintained by jason madden for\n`nextthought

requirements\n===============================\n\n.. _installation:\n\n..\n  this file is included in readme.rst so it is limited to plain\n  rest markup, not sphinx.\n\n.. note::\n\n   if you are reading this document on the `python package index`_\n   (pypi, https://pypi.org/), it is specific to the version of gevent that\n   you are viewing. if you are viewing this document on gevent.org, it\n   refers to the current state of gevent in source control (git\n   master).\n\nsupported platforms\n===================\n\nthis version of gevent runs on python 3.8 and up, (for exact details\nof tested versions, see the classifiers on the pypi page or in\n``setup.py``). gevent requires the `greenlet\n<https://greenlet.readthedocs.io>`_ library and will install the\n`cffi`_ library by default on windows. the cffi library will become\nthe default on all platforms in a future release of gevent.\n\nthis version of gevent is also tested on on pypy 3.10 (7.3.12); it\nshould run on pypy 3.9 and above. on pypy, there are no external\ndependencies.\n\ngevent is tested on windows, macos, and linux, and should run on most\nother unix-like operating systems (e.g., freebsd, solaris, etc.)\n\n.. note::\n\n   windows is supported as a tier 2, \"best effort,\" platform. it is\n   suitable for development, but not recommended for production. in\n   particular, pypy3 on windows may have issues, especially with\n   subprocesses.\n\n   on windows using the deprecated libev backend, gevent is\n   limited to a maximum of 1024 open sockets due to\n   `limitations in libev`_. this limitation should not exist\n   with the default libuv backend.\n\nolder versions of python\n------------------------\n\nusers of older versions of python 2 or python 3 may install an older\nversion of gevent. note that these versions are generally not\nsupported.\n\n+-------+-------+\n|python |gevent |\n|version|version|\n+=======+=======+\n|2.5    |1.0.x  |\n|       |       |\n+-------+-------+\n|2.6

gevent as\n   distributed on the `python package index`_. for building gevent\n   from source, including customizing the build and embedded\n   libraries, see `installing from source`_.\n\n.. _python package index: http://pypi.org/project/gevent\n\ngevent and greenlet can both be installed with `pip`_, e.g., ``pip\ninstall gevent``. installation using `buildout\n<http://docs.buildout.org/en/latest/>`_ is also supported.\n\non windows, macos, and linux, both gevent and greenlet are\ndistributed as binary `wheels`_.\n\n.. tip::\n\n   you need pip 8.0 or later, or buildout 2.10.0 to install the binary\n   wheels on windows or macos. on linux, you'll need `pip 19\n   <https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5008>`_ to install the\n   manylinux2010 wheels.\n\n.. tip::\n\n   while the x86-64 binaries are considered production quality, they\n   are built with relatively low optimization levels and no hardware\n   specific optimizations. serious production users are encouraged to\n   install from source with appropriate compiler flags.\n\n.. tip::\n\n   beginning with gevent 20.12.0, 64-bit arm binaries are distributed\n   on pypi for aarch64 manylinux2014 compatible systems. installing these\n   needs a very recent version of ``pip``. these wheels *do not*\n   contain the c-ares resolver, are not tested, and are built with\n   very low levels of optimizations. serious production users of\n   gevent on 64-bit arm systems are encouraged to build their own\n   binary wheels.\n\n   beginning with gevent 22.10.0, ppc64le binaries are distributed on\n   pypi. the same caveats apply as for 64-bit arm binaries. using them\n   for anything other than local development is discouraged.\n\n   beginning with gevent 23, muslinux aarch64 and s390x binaries\n   are distributed on pypi. the same caveats apply as for 64-bit arm\n   binaries. using them for anything other than local development is\n   discouraged.\n\n\ninstalling from source\n----------------------\n\nif you are unable to use the binary wheels (for platforms where no\npre-built wheels are available or if wheel installation is disabled),\nyou can build gevent from source. a normal ``pip install`` will\nfall back to doing this if no binary wheel is available. see\n`installing from source`_ for more, including common installation issues.\n\nextra dependencies\n==================\n\nthere are a number\nof additional libraries that extend gevent's functionality and will be\nused if they are available. all of these may be installed using\n`setuptools extras\n<https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies>`_,\nas named below, e.g., ``pip install gevent[events]``.\n\nevents\n    in versions of gevent up to and including 20.5.0, this provided configurable\n    event support using `zope.event\n    <https://pypi.org/project/zope.event>`_ and was highly\n    recommended.\n\n    in versions after that, this extra is empty and does nothing. it\n    will be removed in gevent 21.0.\n\ndnspython\n    enables a pure-python resolver, backed by `dnspython\n    <https://pypi.org/project/dnspython>`_. on python 2, this also\n    includes `idna <https://pypi.org/project/idna>`_. they can be\n    installed with the ``dnspython`` extra.\n\n    .. note:: this is not compatible with python 3.10+ or dnspython 2.\n\nmonitor\n    enhancements to gevent's self-monitoring capabilities. this\n    includes the `psutil <https://pypi.org/project/psutil>`_ library\n    which is needed to monitor memory usage. (note that this may not\n    build on all platforms.)\n\nrecommended\n    a shortcut for installing suggested extras together. this includes\n    the non-test extras defined here, plus additions that improve\n    gevent's operation on certain platforms (for example, in the past,\n    it has included backports of newer apis).\n\ntest\n    everything needed to run the complete gevent test suite.\n\n\n.. _`pip`: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/\n.. _`wheels`: http://pythonwheels.com\n.. _`gevent 1.5`: whatsnew_1_5.html\n.. _`installing from source`: https://www.gevent.org/development/installing_from_source.html\n\n.. _`cffi`: https://cffi.readthedocs.io\n.. _`limitations in libev`: http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod#win32_platform_limitations_and_worka\n\n\n.. _bug tracker: https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues\n.. _mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/gevent\n.. _blog: https://dev.nextthought.com/blog/categories/gevent.html\n.. _twitter (@gevent): http://twitter.com/gevent\n",
