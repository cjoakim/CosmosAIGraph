placeholder for hashed password for 'abc'\n    rbriggs:\n      email: rbriggs@gmail.com\n      name: rebecca briggs\n      password: # placeholder for hashed password for 'def'\ncookie:\n  expiry_days: 30\n  key: some_signature_key # must be string\n  name: some_cookie_name\npreauthorized:\n  emails:\n  - melsby@gmail.com\n```\n\n* then use the hasher module to convert the plain text passwords into hashed passwords.\n\n```python\nhashed_passwords = stauth.hasher(['abc', 'def']).generate()\n```\n\n* finally replace the plain text passwords in the configuration file with the hashed passwords.\n\n### 2. creating a login widget\n\n* subsequently import the configuration file into your script and create an authentication object.\n\n```python\nimport yaml\nfrom yaml.loader import safeloader\n\nwith open('../config.yaml') as file:\n    config = yaml.load(file, loader=safeloader)\n\nauthenticator = stauth.authenticate(\n    config['credentials'],\n    config['cookie']['name'],\n    config['cookie']['key'],\n    config['cookie']['expiry_days'],\n    config['preauthorized']\n)\n```\n\n* then finally render the login module as follows. here you will need to provide a name for the login form, and specify where the form should be located i.e. main body or sidebar (will default to main body).\n\n```python\nauthenticator.login('login', 'main')\n```\n![](https://github.com/mkhorasani/streamlit-authenticator/blob/main/graphics/login_form.png)\n\n### 3. authenticating users\n\n* you can then retrieve the name, authentication status, and username from streamlit's session state using **st.session_state[\"name\"]**, **st.session_state[\"authentication_status\"]**, and **st.session_state[\"username\"]** to allow a verified user to proceed to any restricted content.\n* in addition, you may include an optional logout button at any location on your main body or sidebar (will default to main body). the optional **key** parameter for the logout widget should be used with multipage applications to prevent streamlit from throwing duplicate key errors.\n\n```python\nif st.session_state[\"authentication_status\"]:\n    authenticator.logout('logout', 'main', key='unique_key')\n    st.write(f'welcome *{st.session_state[\"name\"]}*')\n    st.title('some content')\nelif st.session_state[\"authentication_status\"] is false:\n    st.error('username/password is incorrect')\nelif st.session_state[\"authentication_status\"] is none:\n    st.warning('please enter your username and password')\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/mkhorasani/streamlit-authenticator/blob/main/graphics/logged_in.png)\n\n* or prompt an unverified user to enter a correct username and password.\n\n![](https://github.com/mkhorasani/streamlit-authenticator/blob/main/graphics/incorrect_login.png)\n\n* please note that logging out will revert the authentication status to **none** and will delete the associated reauthentication cookie as well.\n\n### 4. creating a password reset widget\n\n* you may use the **reset_password** widget to allow a logged in user to modify their password as shown below.\n\n```python\nif st.session_state[\"authentication_status\"]:\n    try:\n        if authenticator.reset_password(st.session_state[\"username\"], 'reset password'):\n            st.success('password modified successfully')\n    except exception as e:\n        st.error(e)\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/mkhorasani/streamlit-authenticator/blob/main/graphics/reset_password.png)\n\n_please remember to update the config file (as shown in step 9) after you use this widget._\n\n### 5. creating a new user registration widget\n\n* you may use the **register_user** widget to allow a user to sign up to your application as shown below. if you require the user to be preauthorized, set the **preauthorization** argument to true and add their email to the **preauthorized** list in the configuration file. once they have registered, their email will be automatically removed from the **preauthorized** list in the configuration file. alternatively, to allow anyone to sign up, set the **preauthorization** argument to false.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    if authenticator.register_user('register user', preauthorization=false):\n        st.success('user registered successfully')\nexcept exception as e:\n    st.error(e)\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/mkhorasani/streamlit-authenticator/blob/main/graphics/register_user.png)\n\n_please remember to update the config file (as shown in step 9) after you use this widget._\n\n### 6. creating a forgot password widget\n\n* you may use the **forgot_password** widget to allow a user to generate a new random password. this password will be automatically hashed and saved in the configuration file. the widget will return the username, email, and new random password of the user which should then be transferred to them securely.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    username_of_forgotten_password, email_of_forgotten_password, new_random_password = authenticator.forgot_password('forgot password')\n    if username_of_forgotten_password:\n        st.success('new password to be sent securely')\n        # random password should be transferred to user securely\n    else:\n        st.error('username not found')\nexcept exception as e:\n    st.error(e)\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/mkhorasani/streamlit-authenticator/blob/main/graphics/forgot_password.png)\n\n_please remember to update the config file (as shown in step 9) after you use this widget._\n\n### 7. creating a forgot username widget\n\n* you may use the **forgot_username** widget to allow a user to retrieve their forgotten username. the widget will return the username and email of the user which should then be transferred to them securely.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    username_of_forgotten_username, email_of_forgotten_username = authenticator.forgot_username('forgot username')\n    if username_of_forgotten_username:\n        st.success('username to be sent securely')\n        # username should be transferred to user securely\n    else:\n        st.error('email not found')\nexcept exception as e:\n    st.error(e)\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/mkhorasani/streamlit-authenticator/blob/main/graphics/forgot_username.png)\n\n### 8. creating an update user details widget\n\n* you may use the **update_user_details** widget to allow a logged in user to update their name and/or email. the widget will automatically save the updated details in both the configuration file and reauthentication cookie.\n\n```python\nif st.session_state[\"authentication_status\"]:\n    try:\n        if authenticator.update_user_details(st.session_state[\"username\"], 'update user details'):\n            st.success('entries updated successfully')\n    except exception as e:\n        st.error(e)\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/mkhorasani/streamlit-authenticator/blob/main/graphics/update_user_details.png)\n\n_please remember to update the config file (as shown in step 9) after you use this widget._\n\n### 9. updating the configuration file\n\n* please ensure that the configuration file is resaved anytime the credentials are updated or whenever the **reset_password**, **register_user**, **forgot_password**, or **update_user_details** widgets are used.\n\n```python\nwith open('../config.yaml', 'w') as file:\n    yaml.dump(config, file, default_flow_style=false)\n```\n\n## credits\n- mohamed abdou for the highly versatile cookie manager in [extra-streamlit-components](https://github.com/mohamed-512/extra-streamlit-components).",
