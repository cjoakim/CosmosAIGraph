  "description": "# aws region-specific information directory\n\n## usage\n\nsome information used in cdk applications differs from one aws region to\nanother, such as service principals used in iam policies, s3 static website\nendpoints, ...\n\n### the `regioninfo` class\n\nthe library offers a simple interface to obtain region specific information in\nthe form of the `regioninfo` class. this is the preferred way to interact with\nthe regional information database:\n\n```python\n# get the information for \"eu-west-1\":\nregion = region_info.regioninfo.get(\"eu-west-1\")\n\n# access attributes:\nregion.s3_static_website_endpoint # s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\nregion.service_principal(\"logs.amazonaws.com\")\n```\n\nthe `regioninfo` layer is built on top of the low-level api, which is described\nbelow and can be used to register additional data, including user-defined facts\nthat are not available through the `regioninfo` interface.\n\n### low-level api\n\nthis library offers a primitive database of such information so that cdk\nconstructs can easily access regional information. the `factname` class provides\na list of known fact names, which can then be used with the `regioninfo` to\nretrieve a particular value:\n\n```python\ncode_deploy_principal = region_info.fact.find(\"us-east-1\", region_info.factname.service_principal(\"codedeploy.amazonaws.com\"))\n# => codedeploy.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\n\nstatic_website = region_info.fact.find(\"ap-northeast-1\", region_info.factname.s3_static_website_endpoint)\n```\n\n## supplying new or missing information\n\nas new regions are released, it might happen that a particular fact you need is\nmissing from the library. in such cases, the `fact.register` method can be used\nto inject factname into the database:\n\n```python\n@jsii.implements(region_info.ifact)\nclass myfact:\n\nregion_info.fact.register(myfact())\n```\n\n## overriding incorrect information\n\nin the event information provided by the library is incorrect, it can be\noverridden using the same `fact.register` method demonstrated above, simply\nadding an extra boolean argument:\n\n```python\n@jsii.implements(region_info.ifact)\nclass myfact:\n\nregion_info.fact.register(myfact(), true)\n```\n\nif you happen to have stumbled upon incorrect data built into this library, it\nis always a good idea to report your findings in a [github issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues), so we can fix\nit for everyone else!\n\n---\n\n\nthis module is part of the [aws cloud development kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.\n",
