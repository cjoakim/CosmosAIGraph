  "description": "welcome to wxpython's project phoenix! phoenix is the improved next-generation\nwxpython, \"better, stronger, faster than he was before.\" this new\nimplementation is focused on improving speed, maintainability and\nextensibility. just like \"classic\" wxpython, phoenix wraps the wxwidgets c++\ntoolkit and provides access to the user interface portions of the wxwidgets\napi, enabling python applications to have a native gui on windows, macs or\nunix systems, with a native look and feel and requiring very little (if any)\nplatform specific code.\n\nfor more information please refer to the\n`readme file <https://github.com/wxwidgets/phoenix/blob/wxpython-4.2.1/readme.rst>`_,\nthe `migration guide <http://docs.wxpython.org/migrationguide.html>`_,\nor the `wxpython api documentation <http://docs.wxpython.org/index.html>`_.\n\narchive files containing a copy of the wxpython documentation, the demo and\nsamples, and also a set of msvc .pdb files for windows are available\n`here <https://extras.wxpython.org/wxpython4/extras/>`_.\n\nthe utility tools wxdocs and wxdemo will download the appropriate files with wxget,\n(if necessary), unpack them, (if necessary) and launch the appropriate version of\nthe respective items. (documents are launched in the default browser and demo is started\nwith python).\n",
