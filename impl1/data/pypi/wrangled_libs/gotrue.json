... any other headers you might need.\n}\nclient: syncgotrueclient = syncgotrueclient(url=\"www.genericauthwebsite.com\", headers=headers)\n```\n\nto send a magic email link to the user, just provide the email kwarg to the `sign_in` method:\n\n```python\nuser: dict[str, any] = client.sign_up(email=\"example@gmail.com\")\n```\n\nto login with email and password, provide both to the `sign_in` method:\n\n```python\nuser: dict[str, any] = client.sign_up(email=\"example@gmail.com\", password=\"*********\")\n```\n\nto sign out of the logged in user, call the `sign_out` method. we can then assert that the session and user are null values.\n\n```python\nclient.sign_out()\nassert client.user() is none\nassert client.session() is none\n```\n\nwe can refesh a users session.\n\n```python\n# the user should already be signed in at this stage.\nuser = client.refresh_session()\nassert client.user() is not none\nassert client.session() is not none\n```\n\n## contributions\n\nwe would be immensely grateful for any contributions to this project. in particular are the following items:\n\n",
