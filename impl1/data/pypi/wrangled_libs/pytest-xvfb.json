  "description": "pytest-xvfb\n===================================\n\na pytest plugin to run `xvfb`_ (or `xephyr`_/`xvnc`_) for tests.\n\n----\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\nyou can install \"`pytest-xvfb`_\" via `pip`_ from `pypi`_::\n\n    $ pip install pytest-xvfb\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nwith xvfb and the plugin installed, your testsuite automatically runs with `xvfb`_. this allows tests to be run without windows popping up during gui tests or on systems without a display (like a ci).\n\nthe plugin sees xvfb being installed as \"optional\", since the tests can still\nrun without it installed. if it's unavailable, it will show an informational\nmessage, if on linux and a ``display`` is available. when using\n``--xvfb-backend xvfb``, this message will turn into a hard error instead.\n\nif you're currently using ``xvfb-run`` in something like a github actions yaml\nfile simply remove the wrapper and install this plugin instead - then you'll\nalso have the benefits of xvfb locally.\n\nfeatures\n--------\n\nyou can pass ``--no-xvfb`` to explicitly turn off xvfb (e.g. to visually\ninspect a failure).\n\nwith ``--xvfb-backend xephyr`` or ``--xvfb-backend xvnc``, you can use xephyr\nor xvnc in place of xvfb, e.g. to visually inspect failures.\n\n**note:** support for ``xvnc`` is currently experimental and not tested on ci,\ndue to incompatibilities with pyvirtualdisplay and ubuntu 22.04's tightvncserver.\n\nyou can mark tests with ``@pytest.mark.no_xvfb`` to skip them when they're\nrunning with xvfb.\n\na ``xvfb`` fixture is available with the following attributes:\n\n- ``width``: the configured width of the screen.\n- ``height``: the configured height of the screen.\n- ``colordepth``: the configured colordepth of the screen.\n- ``args``: the arguments to be passed to xvfb.\n- ``display``: the display number (as int) which is used.\n- ``backend``: either ``none`` (xvfb), ``\"xvfb\"``, ``\"xephyr\"``, or ``\"xvnc\"``.\n\nin a pytest.ini, ``xvfb_width``, ``xvfb_height``, ``xvfb_colordepth`` and\n``xvfb_args`` can be used to configure the respective values. in addition,\n``xvfb_xauth`` can be set to ``true`` to generate an ``xauthority`` token.\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\ncontributions are very welcome. tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\nlicense\n-------\n\ndistributed under the terms of the `mit`_ license, \"pytest-xvfb\" is free and open source software\n\nthanks\n------\n\nthis `pytest`_ plugin was generated with `cookiecutter`_ along with\n`@hackebrot`_'s `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.\n\nthanks to `@cgoldberg`_ for `xvfbwrapper`_ which was the inspiration for this\nproject.\n\nissues\n------\n\nif you encounter any problems, please `file an issue`_ along with a detailed description.\n\n.. _`pytest-xvfb`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xvfb/\n.. _`cookiecutter`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _`@hackebrot`: https://github.com/hackebrot\n.. _`@cgoldberg`: https://github.com/cgoldberg\n.. _`xvfbwrapper`: https://github.com/cgoldberg/xvfbwrapper\n.. _`mit`: http://opensource.org/licenses/mit\n.. _`cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin\n.. _`file an issue`: https://github.com/the-compiler/pytest-xvfb/issues\n.. _`pytest`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest\n.. _`tox`: https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _`pip`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/\n.. _`pypi`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi\n.. _`xvfb`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xvfb\n.. _`xephyr`: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/software/xephyr/\n.. _`xvnc`: https://tigervnc.org/doc/xvnc.html\n",
