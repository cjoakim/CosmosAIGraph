(originally, the data files were erroneously showing up during testing, despite not being included in the distribution).\n- moves the data file generation into a simple cli. this way, users have a method for controlling when the data files are updated.\n- since the data files are now included in the distribution, the cli is made optional. its dependencies can be installed with the `cli` bundle, eg. `pip install confusable_homoglyphs[cli]`.\n\n",
