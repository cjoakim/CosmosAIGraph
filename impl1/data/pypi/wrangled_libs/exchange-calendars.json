exchange\n>>> xhkg = xcals.get_calendar(\"xhkg\")  # hong kong stock exchange\n```\nquery the schedule:\n\n```python\n>>> xhkg.schedule.loc[\"2021-12-29\":\"2022-01-04\"]\n```\n<!-- base of output

over [50 pre-defined calendars](#calendars), including major security exchanges.\n\nif you can't find what you're after, a custom calendar can be created as a subclass of [exchangecalendar](exchange_calendars/exchange_calendar.py). [this workflow](.github/pull_request_template.md) describes the process to add a new calendar to `exchange_calendars`. just follow the relevant parts.\n\nto access the new calendar via `get_calendar` call either `xcals.register_calendar` or `xcals.register_calendar_type` to register, respectively, a specific calendar instance or a calendar factory (i.e. the subclass).\n\n### **can i contribute a new calendar to exchange calendars?**\n\nyes please! the workflow can be found [here](.github/pull_request_template.md).\n\n### **`<calendar>` is missing a holiday, has a wrong time, should have a break etc...**\n\n**all** of the exchange calendars are maintained by user contributions. if a calendar you care about needs revising, please open a [pr](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars/pulls) - that's how this thing works! (never contributed to a project before and it all seems a bit daunting? check [this out](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/readme.md) and don't look back!)\n\nyou'll find the workflow to modify an existing calendar [here](.github/pull_request_template.md).\n\n### **what times are considered open and closed?**\n\n`exchange_calendars` attempts to be broadly useful by considering an exchange to be open only during periods of regular trading. during any pre-trading, post-trading or auction period the exchange is treated as closed. an exchange is also treated as closed during any observed lunch break.\n\nsee the [minutes tutorial](docs/tutorials/minutes.ipynb) for a detailed explanation of which minutes an exchange is considered open over. if you previously used `trading_calendars`, or `exchange_calendars` prior to release 3.4, then this is the place to look for answers to questions of how the definition of trading minutes has changed over time (and is now stable and flexible!).\n\n## calendars\n\n| exchange                        | iso code | country        | version added | exchange website (english)
