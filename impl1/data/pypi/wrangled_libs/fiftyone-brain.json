brain](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html)\nprovides powerful machine learning techniques that are designed to transform\nhow you curate your data from an art into a measurable science.\n\nthe fiftyone brain is a separate python package that is bundled with\n[fiftyone](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone). although it is closed-source, it\nis licensed as freeware, and you have permission to use it for commercial or\nnon-commercial purposes. see the license below for more details.\n\nthe fiftyone brain methods are useful across the stages of the machine learning\nworkflow:\n\n-   **[uniqueness](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#image-uniqueness):**\n    during the training loop for a model, the best results will be seen when\n    training on unique data. the fiftyone brain provides a uniqueness measure\n    for images that compare the content of every image in a fiftyone dataset\n    with all other images. uniqueness operates on raw images and does not\n    require any prior annotation on the data. it is hence very useful in the\n    early stages of the machine learning workflow when you are likely asking\n    \"what data should i select to annotate?\"\n\n-   **[mistakenness](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#label-mistakes):**\n    annotations mistakes create an artificial ceiling on the performance of\n    your models. however, finding these mistakes by hand is at least as arduous\n    as the original annotation was, especially in cases of larger datasets. the\n    fiftyone brain provides a quantitative mistakenness measure to identify\n    possible label mistakes. mistakenness operates on labeled images and\n    requires the logit-output of your model predictions in order to provide\n    maximum efficacy. it also works on detection datasets to find missed\n    objects, incorrect annotations, and localization issues.\n\n-   **[hardness](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#sample-hardness):**\n    while a model is training, it will learn to understand attributes of\n    certain samples faster than others. the fiftyone brain provides a hardness\n    measure that calculates how easy or difficult it is for your model to\n    understand any given sample. mining hard samples is a tried and true\n    measure of mature machine learning processes. use your current model\n    instance to compute predictions on unlabeled samples to determine which are\n    the most valuable to have annotated and fed back into the system as\n    training samples, for example.\n\n## license\n\ncopyright 2022, voxel51, inc.\nall rights reserved.\n\nfreeware license and end-user license agreement\nfor the fiftyone
