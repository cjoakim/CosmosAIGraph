  "description": "# ursina    \u0295 \u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\u309d\u25a1\nan easy to use game engine/framework for python.\n\n![banner](/docs/made_with_ursina.jpg)\n\n[![trailer](/docs/ursina_trailer_preview.webp)](https://youtu.be/j71j88octno)\n\n## getting started\n1) install python 3.6 or newer. https://www.python.org/downloads/\n2) open cmd/terminal and type:\n\n```\npip install ursina\n```\n\n\nif you want to install the newest version from git, you can install like this:\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git\n```\n\n\nif you want to easily edit the source, it's recommended to clone the git\nrepo and install as develop like this. make sure you have git installed. https://git-scm.com/\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n\nalso install any of the optional dependencies you want from the list below,\nor install them all with:\n\n```\npip install ursina[extras]\n```\n\n\non some systems you might have to use pip3 instead of pip in order to use python 3 and not the old python 2.\n\n\n## dependencies\n  * python 3.6+\n  * panda3d\n  * pillow, for texture manipulation\n  * psd-tools, for converting .psd files\n  * blender, for converting .blend files\n  * pyperclip, for copy/pasting\n\n\n## examples\n``` python\nfrom ursina import *            # this will import everything we need from ursina with just one line.\n\napp = ursina()\nground = entity(\n    model = 'cube',\n    color = color.magenta,\n    z = -.1,\n    y = -3,\n    origin = (0, .5),\n    scale = (50, 1, 10),\n    collider = 'box',\n    )\n\napp.run()                       # opens a window and starts the game.\n```\n\n\n* [minecraft clone](/samples/minecraft_clone.py)\n\n* [platformer game](/samples/platformer.py)\n\n\n## how do i make a game?\nursina games are made by writing python code. you can use any text editor you want, but personally i like to use atom.\n1) create an empty .py file called `ursina_game.py`\n2) copy this text into your new file:\n``` python\nfrom ursina import *           # this will import everything we need from ursina with just one line.\n\napp = ursina()\n\nplayer = entity(\n    model = 'cube' ,           # finds a 3d model by name\n    color = color.orange,\n    scale_y = 2\n    )\n\ndef update():                  # update gets automatically called by the engine.\n    player.x += held_keys['d'] * .1\n    player.x -= held_keys['a'] * .1\n\n\napp.run()                     # opens a window and starts the game.\n```\n\n3) type this in the terminal to start the game:\n\n       python ursina_game.py\n   if you use atom, i recommend installing the package atom-python-run to run your scripts with the press of a button.\n\n4) you can now move the orange box around with 'a' and 'd'!\n\n   to close the window, you can by default, press shift+q or press the red x. to disable this, write `window.exit_button.enabled = false` somewhere in your code.\n\n\n## project structure\n```\n## project structure\n\n\ud83d\udcc1docs\n    \ud83d\udcc3index.txt\n    \ud83d\udcc3documentation.txt\n    \ud83d\udcc3inventory_tutorial.txt\n    ...\n        # text files for the website. gets turned into .html files with sswg.\n\n    \ud83d\udcc3cheat_sheet.html\n        # auto generated documentation made with documentation_generator.py.\n\n    \ud83d\udcc3tutorial_generator.py\n        # turns specific .py files into .txt files, which can then be turned into .html by sswg.\n        # this extracts the comments from the source files into description for that step and the code after into code blocks.\n        # see platformer_tutorial.py for an example.\n\n\ud83d\udcc1samples               # small example games.\n\n\ud83d\udcc1ursina                # the actual ursina module.\n    \ud83d\udcc1audio                 # built-in audio clips.\n    \ud83d\udcc1editor                # the 3d level editor for ursina.\n    \ud83d\udcc1fonts                 # built-in fonts.\n    \ud83d\udcc1models                # .blend files, source files, for built-in 3d models.\n        \ud83d\udcc1procedural            # classes for generating 3d models, like cylinder, quad and terrain.\n    \ud83d\udcc1models_compressed     # .blend files converted to .ursinamesh.\n    \ud83d\udcc1prefabs               # higher level classes like draggable, slider, sprite, etc.\n\n    \ud83d\udcc3__init__.py\n    \ud83d\udcc3application.py\n    \ud83d\udcc3audio.py\n    ...\n        # ursina base modules, like code for entity, input_handler, text, window and so on.\n\n```\n",
