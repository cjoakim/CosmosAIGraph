using `requests_kerberos` package  \n\nto avoid deployment issues on a non kerberized environment, the `requests_kerberos`\ndependency is optional and needs to be explicit installed in order to enable access\nto yarn console protected by kerberos/spnego.\n\n`pip install requests_kerberos`\n\nfrom python code\n```\nfrom yarn_api_client.history_server import historyserver\nfrom requests_kerberos import httpkerberosauth\nhistory_server = historyserver('https://127.0.0.2:5678', auth=httpkerberosauth())\n```\n\nps: you **need** to get valid kerberos ticket in systemwide kerberos cache before running your code, otherwise calls to kerberized environment won't go through (run kinit before proceeding to run code)\n\n2. second option - using `gssapi` package  \n\nif you want to avoid using terminal calls, you have to perform spnego handshake to retrieve ticket yourself. full api documentation: https://pythongssapi.github.io/python-gssapi/latest/\n\n# usage\n\n### cli interface\n\n**warning**: cli is outdated & broken. please don't use cli. this will be resolved in future releases.\n\n1. first way\n```\nbin/yarn_client --help\n```\n\n2. alternative way\n```\npython -m yarn_api_client --help\n```\n\n### programmatic interface\n\n```\nfrom yarn_api_client import applicationmaster, historyserver, nodemanager, resourcemanager\nam = applicationmaster('https://127.0.0.2:5678')\napp_information = am.application_information('application_id')\n```\n\n### changelog\n\n1.0.3 release\n   - drop support of python 2.7 (if you still need it for extreme emergency, look into reverting ab4f71582f8c69e908db93905485ba4d00562dfd)\n   - update of supported hadoop version to 3.3.1\n   - add support for yarn_conf_dir and hadoop_conf_dir\n   -

resourcemanager has been updated to take a list of endpoints for\n       improved ha support.\n     - resourcemanager, applicationmaster, historyserver and nodemanager\n       have been updated with methods corresponding to the latest rest api.\n   - pytest support on windows has been provided.\n   - documentation has been updated.\n\n   **note:** applications using apis relative to releases prior to 1.0 should\n   pin their dependency on yarn-api-client to _less than_ 1.0 and are encouraged\n   to update to 1.0 as soon as possible.\n\n0.3.7 release  \n   - honor configured http policy when no address is provided - enabling\n     using of https in these cases.\n\n0.3.6 release  \n   - extend resourcemanager to allow applications to determine\n     resource availability prior to submission.\n\n0.3.5 release  \n   -
