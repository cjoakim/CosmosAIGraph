  "description": "`pylibmc` is a python client for `memcached <http://memcached.org/>`_ written in c.\n\nsee `the documentation at sendapatch.se/projects/pylibmc/`__ for more information.\n\n__ http://sendapatch.se/projects/pylibmc/\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/lericson/pylibmc/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/lericson/pylibmc/actions/workflows/ci.yml\n\nnew in version 1.6.0\n====================\n\nthough no major feature overhauls have taken place, this release is partially\nincompatible with 1.5.0. this stems from the fact that python-memcached is now\nusing a flag that pylibmc has been using for some years. python-memcached uses\nit for a different purpose, and an incompatible one. we deemed that it would be\nbetter to support this interoperability. the change also means that unicode\nstrings are now stored as utf-8 rather than pickled, which may or may not\nresult in a slight performance improvement for this type of data.\n\nwe have also introduced a `pickle_protocol` behavior to enable seamless\ninteroperability between python 2.x and 3.x. also, this release introduces a\nmanylinux wheel, making installation a breeze on manylinux systems (which i\nsuppose is many linuxes.)\n\nnew in version 1.5.0\n====================\n\nthis release fixes critical memory leaks in common code paths introduced in\n1.4.2. also fixes a critical bug in a corner of the zlib inflation code, where\nprior memory errors would trigger a double free. thank you to everybody\ninvolved in the making of this release, and especially `eau de web`__, without\ntheir contributions, this release and the bug fixes it contains wouldn't have\nbeen so expedient.\n\n__ http://www.eaudeweb.ro/\n\n.. comment: 1.5.x should have been an extension to 1.4.x, therefore it's best\n   to keep the 1.4.x release announcement below.\n\nnew in version 1.4.0\n====================\n\nbrace yourself, python 3.x support has come!\n\nthanks to everybody involved in this project; this release involves less\nauthors but **a lot** more work per person. thanks especially to harvey falcic\nfor the work he put in, without which there wouldn't be any python 3.x support.\nalso thanks to sergey pashinin for the initial stab at the problem.\n\nother than that, we had miscellaneous bug fixes, testing improvements, and\ndocumentation updates.\n\nlast but not least i would like to ask for your support in this project, either\nby helping out with development, testing, documentation or anything at all; or\nsimply by donating some `magic internet money`__ to the project's bitcoin\naddress `12dvekhqijwcy8zxt4kahdhelxpegauo9h`__.\n\n__ http://static.adzerk.net/advertisers/5af77cf0094d4303bb308b955dd05992.jpg\n__ bitcoin:12dvekhqijwcy8zxt4kahdhelxpegauo9h\n\nlicense\n=======\n\nreleased under the bsd 3-clause license; see `license <license>`_ for details.\n\nmaintainer\n==========\n\n- website: `sendapatch.se/ <http://sendapatch.se/>`_\n- github: `github.com/lericson <http://github.com/lericson>`_\n- irc: ``lericson`` in ``#sendapatch`` on ``chat.freenode.net``\n- e-mail: ``ludvig`` at ``sendapatch.se``\n\n------\n\n.. image:: http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20110908.gif\n   :target: http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2362\n   :align: center\n",
