:target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-pylint\n\nrun pylint with pytest and have configurable rule types\n(i.e. convention, warn, and error) fail the build.  you can also\nspecify a pylintrc file.\n\nsample usage\n============\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   py.test --pylint\n\nwould be the most simple usage and would run pylint for all error messages.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   py.test --pylint --pylint-rcfile=/my/pyrc --pylint-error-types=ef --pylint-jobs=4\n\nthis would use the pylintrc file at /my/pyrc, only error on pylint\nerrors and failures, and use 4 cores for running pylint.\n\nyou can restrict your test run to only perform pylint checks and not any other\ntests by typing:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    py.test --pylint -m pylint\n\nacknowledgements\n================\n\nthis code is heavily based on\n`pytest-flakes <https://github.com/fschulze/pytest-flakes>`__\n\ndevelopment\n===========\n\nif you want to help
