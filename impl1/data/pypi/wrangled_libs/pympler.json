  "description": "readme for pympler\n==================\n\npympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the memory\nbehavior of python objects in a running python application.\n\nby pympling a python application, detailed insight in the size and the lifetime\nof python objects can be obtained.  undesirable or unexpected runtime behavior\nlike memory bloat and other \"pymples\" can easily be identified.\n\npympler integrates three previously separate projects into a single,\ncomprehensive profiling tool. asizeof provides basic size information for one\nor several python objects, muppy is used for on-line monitoring of a python\napplication and the class tracker provides off-line analysis of the lifetime of\nselected python objects. a web profiling frontend exposes process statistics,\ngarbage visualisation and class tracker statistics.\n\npympler is written entirely in python, with no dependencies to external\nlibraries. it has been tested with python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 on linux,\nwindows and macos x.\n\n\ninstallation from pypi\n----------------------\n\nto install the latest version of pympler from the python package index run:\n\n    pip install pympler\n\n\ninstallation from source\n------------------------\n\nbefore installing pympler, try it with your python version:\n\n    python setup.py try\n\nif any errors are reported, check whether your python version is supported.\npympler is written entirely in python, with no dependencies other than standard\npython modules and libraries. pympler works with python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and\n3.10.\n\nfor a system-wide installation from source run:\n\n    pip install .\n\ntest the installed pympler package:\n\n    python setup.py test\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nthe usage of pympler is described in the documentation.  it is\navailable either in this distribution at *doc/index.html* or\nyou can [read it online](https://pympler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\nyou can post wishes, bug reports or patches at our\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/pympler/pympler/issues) or\nwrite an email to *pympler-dev@googlegroups.com*.\n\n[![latest version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pympler.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pympler/)\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pympler.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pympler/)\n[![coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/pympler/pympler/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/pympler/pympler?branch=master)\n\n\n",
