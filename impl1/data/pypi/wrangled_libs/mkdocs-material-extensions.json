pymdownx.emoji:\n      emoji_index: !!python/name:materialx.emoji.twemoji\n      emoji_generator: !!python/name:materialx.emoji.to_svg\n```\n\nthen, using the folder structure of material's `.icons` folder, you can specify icons:\n\n```\nwe can use material icons :material-airplane:.\n\nwe can also use fontawesome icons :fontawesome-solid-ambulance:.\n\nthat's not all, we can also use octicons :octicons-octoface:.\n```\n\n## using local custom icons\n\nin mkdocs, you can override theme assets locally, and even add assets to the theme. unfortunately, the markdown parsing\nprocess isn't aware of the mkdocs environment. luckily, if you are using pymdown extensions 7.1, you can pass in custom\nicon paths that will be used when constructing the emoji index and include your custom svg assets. if a folder path of\n`theme/my_icons` was given to the index builder, all icons under `my_project/my_icons`, even in sub-folders, would\nbecome part of the index.\n\n```yaml\nmarkdown_extensions:\n  - pymdownx.emoji:\n      emoji_index: !!python/name:materialx.emoji.twemoji\n      emoji_generator: !!python/name:materialx.emoji.to_svg\n      options:\n        custom_icons:\n          - theme/my_icons\n```\n\nif given an icon at `my_project/my_icons/animals/bird.svg`, the icon would be available using the emoji syntax as\n`:animals-bird:`. notice that the base folder that is provided doesn't contribute to the icon's name. also, folders\nare separated with `-`. folder names and icon names should be compatible with the emoji syntax, so special characters\nshould be avoided -- `-` and `_` are okay.\n\nyou can provide as many paths as you would like, and they will be evaluated in the order that they are specified. the\nmaterial theme's own icons will be evaluated after all custom paths. this allows a user to override material's icons if\ndesired.\n\nif an icon name is already in the index, the icon will not be added. it is recommended to always have your icons in\nsub-folders to help namespace them to avoid name collisions. in the example above, `bird` was under `animals` which\ncreated the name `:animals-bird:` and helped create a more unique name with less of a chance of creating a duplicate\nname with existing emoji and material icons.\n\n[emoji]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/emoji/\n[emoji-index]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/emoji/#custom-emoji-indexes\n[emoji-generator]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/emoji/#custom-emoji-generators\n[mkdocs-material]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material\n\n[donate-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/donate-paypal-3fabd1?logo=paypal\n[donate-link]: https://www.paypal.me/facelessuser\n[github-ci-image]: https://github.com/facelessuser/mkdocs-material-extensions/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push\n[github-ci-link]: https://github.com/facelessuser/mkdocs-material-extensions/actions?query=workflow%3abuild+branch%3amaster\n[discord-image]: https://img.shields.io/discord/678289859768745989?logo=discord&logocolor=aaaaaa&color=mediumpurple&labelcolor=333333\n[discord-link]: https://discord.gg/tws8tgr\n[codecov-image]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/facelessuser/mkdocs-material-extensions/master.svg?logo=codecov&logocolor=aaaaaa&labelcolor=333333\n[codecov-link]: https://codecov.io/github/facelessuser/mkdocs-material-extensions\n[pypi-image]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mkdocs-material-extensions.svg?logo=pypi&logocolor=aaaaaa&labelcolor=333333\n[pypi-link]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mkdocs-material-extensions\n[python-image]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mkdocs-material-extensions?logo=python&logocolor=aaaaaa&labelcolor=333333\n[license-image-mit]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-mit-blue.svg?labelcolor=333333\n",
