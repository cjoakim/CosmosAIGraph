each other and predicting the outcome when some of them are changed to new values. for instance, given an outcome variable, one may be interested in determining how a potential action(s) may affect it, understanding what led to its current value, or simulate what would happen if some variables are changed. answering such questions requires causal reasoning. dowhy is a python library that guides you through the various steps of causal reasoning and provides a unified interface for answering causal questions.\n\ndowhy provides a wide variety of algorithms for effect estimation, prediction, quantification\nof causal influences, diagnosis of causal structures, root cause analysis, interventions and\ncounterfactuals. a key feature of dowhy is its refutation and falsification api that can test causal assumptions for any estimation method,\nthus making inference more robust and accessible to non-experts.\n\n**graphical causal models and potential outcomes: best of both worlds**\n\ndowhy builds on two of the most powerful frameworks for causal inference:\ngraphical causal models and potential outcomes. for effect estimation, it uses graph-based criteria and do-calculus for\nmodeling assumptions and identifying a non-parametric causal effect. for estimation, it switches to methods based\nprimarily on potential outcomes.\n\nfor causal questions beyond effect estimation, it uses the power of graphical causal models by modeling the data\ngeneration process via explicit causal mechanisms at each node, which, for instance, unlocks capabilities to attribute\nobserved effects to particular variables or estimate point-wise counterfactuals.\n\nfor a quick introduction to causal inference, check out `amit-sharma/causal-inference-tutorial <https://github.com/amit-sharma/causal-inference-tutorial/>`_\nwe also gave a more comprehensive tutorial at the acm knowledge discovery and data mining (`kdd 2018 <http://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/>`_) conference: `causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial <http://causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial/>`_.\nfor an introduction to the four steps of causal inference and its implications for machine learning, you can access this video tutorial from microsoft research `dowhy webinar <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/foundations-of-causal-inference-and-its-impacts-on-machine-learning/>`_ and for an introduction to the graphical causal model api, see the `pycon presentation on root cause analysis with dowhy <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icphrbdlgaw>`_.\n\nkey features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/py-why/dowhy/main/docs/images/dowhy-features.png\n\ndowhy supports the following causal tasks:\n\n- effect estimation (identification, average causal effect, conditional average causal effect, instrumental variables and more)\n- quantify causal influences (mediation analysis, direct arrow strength, intrinsic causal influence)\n- what-if analysis (generate samples from interventional distribution, estimate counterfactuals)\n- root cause analysis and explanations (attribute anomalies to their causes, find causes for changes in distributions, estimate feature relevance and more)\n\nfor more details and how to use these methods in practice, checkout the documentation at `https://py-why.github.io/dowhy <https://py-why.github.io/dowhy/>`_\n\nquick start\n===========\ndowhy support python 3.8+. to install, you can use pip, poetry, or conda.\n\n**latest release**\n\ninstall the latest `release <https://pypi.org/project/dowhy/>`__ using pip.\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n   pip install dowhy\n\ninstall the latest `release <https://pypi.org/project/dowhy/>`__ using poetry.\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n   poetry add dowhy\n\ninstall the latest `release <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dowhy>`__ using conda.\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n   conda install -c conda-forge dowhy\n\nif you face \"solving environment\" problems with conda, then try :code:`conda update --all` and then install dowhy. if that does not work, then use :code:`conda config --set channel_priority false` and try to install again. if the problem persists, please `add your issue here <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/issues/197>`_.\n\n**development version**\n\nif you prefer to use the latest dev version, your dependency management tool will need to point at our github repository.\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/py-why/dowhy@main\n\n\n**requirements**\n\ndowhy requires a few dependencies. \ndetails on specific versions can be found in `pyproject.toml <./pyproject.toml>`_, under the `tool.poetry.dependencies` section.\n\nif you face any problems, try installing dependencies manually.\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    pip install '<dependency-name>==<version>'\n\noptionally, if you wish to input graphs in the dot format, then install pydot (or pygraphviz).\n\nfor better-looking graphs, you can optionally install pygraphviz. to proceed,\nfirst install graphviz and then pygraphviz (on ubuntu and ubuntu wsl).\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    sudo apt install graphviz libgraphviz-dev graphviz-dev pkg-config\n    ## from https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/issues/71\n    pip install pygraphviz --install-option=\"--include-path=/usr/include/graphviz\" \\\n    --install-option=\"--library-path=/usr/lib/graphviz/\"\n\nexample: effect identification and estimation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nmost causal tasks in dowhy only require a few lines of code to write. here, we exemplarily estimate the causal effect of\na treatment on an outcome variable:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from dowhy import causalmodel\n    import dowhy.datasets\n\n    # load some sample data\n    data = dowhy.datasets.linear_dataset(\n        beta=10,\n        num_common_causes=5,\n        num_instruments=2,\n        num_samples=10000,\n        treatment_is_binary=true)\n\na causal graph can be defined in different way, but the most common way is via `networkx <https://networkx.org/>`_.\nafter loading in the data, we use the four main operations for effect estimation in dowhy: *model*, *identify*,\n*estimate* and *refute*:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # i. create a causal model from the data and given graph.\n    model = causalmodel(\n        data=data[\"df\"],\n        treatment=data[\"treatment_name\"],\n        outcome=data[\"outcome_name\"],\n        graph=data[\"gml_graph\"])  # or alternatively, as nx.digraph\n\n    # ii. identify causal effect and return target estimands\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\n    # iii. estimate the target estimand using a statistical method.\n    estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                     method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\")\n\n    # iv. refute the obtained estimate using multiple robustness checks.\n    refute_results = model.refute_estimate(identified_estimand, estimate,\n                                           method_name=\"random_common_cause\")\n\ndowhy stresses on the interpretability of its output. at any point in the analysis,\nyou can inspect the untested assumptions, identified estimands (if any), and the\nestimate (if any). here's a sample output of the linear regression estimator:\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/py-why/dowhy/main/docs/images/regression_output.png\n    :width: 80%\n\nfor a full code example, check out the `getting started with dowhy <https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/main/example_notebooks/dowhy_simple_example.html>`_ notebook.\n\nyou can also use conditional average treatment effect (cate) estimation methods from `econml <https://github.com/py-why/econml>`_, as shown in the `conditional treatment effects <https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/main/example_notebooks/dowhy-conditional-treatment-effects.html>`_ notebook. here's a code snippet.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n\tfrom sklearn.preprocessing import polynomialfeatures\n\tfrom sklearn.linear_model import lassocv\n\tfrom sklearn.ensemble import gradientboostingregressor\n\tdml_estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=\"backdoor.econml.dml.dml\",\n                        control_value = 0,\n                        treatment_value = 1,\n                        target_units = lambda df: df[\"x0\"]>1,\n                        confidence_intervals=false,\n                        method_params={\n                            \"init_params\":{'model_y':gradientboostingregressor(),\n                                           'model_t': gradientboostingregressor(),\n                                           'model_final':lassocv(),\n                                           'featurizer':polynomialfeatures(degree=1, include_bias=true)},\n                            \"fit_params\":{}})\n\n\nexample: graphical causal model (gcm) based inference\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ndowhy's graphical causal model framework offers powerful tools to address causal questions beyond effect estimation.\nit is based on pearl's graphical causal model framework and models the causal data generation process of each variable\nexplicitly via *causal mechanisms* to support a wide range of causal algorithms. for more details, see the book\n`elements of causal inference <https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037310/elements-of-causal-inference/>`_.\n\ncomplex causal queries, such as attributing observed anomalies to nodes in the system, can be performed with just a few\nlines of code:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import networkx as nx, numpy as np, pandas as pd\n    from dowhy import gcm\n\n    # let's generate some \"normal\" data we assume we're given from our problem domain:\n    x = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)\n    y = 2 * x + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)\n    z = 3 * y + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)\n    data = pd.dataframe(dict(x=x, y=y, z=z))\n\n    # 1. modeling cause-effect relationships as a structural causal model\n    #    (causal graph + functional causal models):\n    causal_model = gcm.structuralcausalmodel(nx.digraph([('x', 'y'), ('y', 'z')]))  # x -> y -> z\n    gcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(causal_model, data)\n\n    # 2. fitting the scm to the data:\n    gcm.fit(causal_model, data)\n\n    # optional: evaluate causal model\n    print(gcm.evaluate_causal_model(causal_model, data))\n\n    # step 3: perform a causal analysis.\n    # results = gcm.<causal_query>(causal_model, ...)\n    # for instance, root cause analysis:\n    anomalous_sample = pd.dataframe(dict(x=[0.1], y=[6.2], z=[19]))  # here, y is the root cause.\n\n    # \"which node is the root cause of the anomaly in z?\":\n    anomaly_attribution = gcm.attribute_anomalies(causal_model, \"z\", anomalous_sample)\n\n    # or sampling from an interventional distribution. here, under the intervention do(y := 2).\n    samples = gcm.interventional_samples(causal_model, interventions={'y': lambda y: 2}, num_samples_to_draw=100)\n\nthe gcm framework offers many more features beyond these examples. for a full code example, check out the `online shop example notebook <https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/main/example_notebooks/gcm_online_shop.html>`_.\n\nfor more functionalities, example applications of dowhy and details about the outputs, see the `user guide
