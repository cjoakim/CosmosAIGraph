  "description": "**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.\n\nthis package installs the [dbt cloud cli](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/configure-cloud-cli) to invoke dbt commands from the command line that execute in a [dbt cloud](cloud.getdbt.com) environment.\n\n## understanding dbt\n\nanalysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse.\n\nthese select statements, or \"models\", form a dbt project. models frequently build on top of one another \u2013 dbt makes it easy to [manage relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/ref) between models, and [visualize these relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation), as well as assure the quality of your transformations through [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing).\n\n![dbt dag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/6c6649f9129d5d108aa3b0526f634cd8f3a9d1ed/etc/dbt-dag.png)\n\n## join the dbt community\n\n- be part of the conversation in the [dbt community slack](http://community.getdbt.com/)\n- read more on the [dbt community discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com)\n",
