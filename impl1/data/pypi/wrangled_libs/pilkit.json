  "description": "pilkit is a collection of utilities for working with pil (the python imaging\nlibrary).\n\none of its main features is a set of **processors** which expose a simple\ninterface for performing manipulations on pil images.\n\nlooking for more advanced processors? check out `instakit`_!\n\n**for the complete documentation on the latest stable version of pilkit, see**\n`pilkit on rtd`_.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/matthewwithanm/pilkit/workflows/python%20ci/badge.svg\n  :target: https://github.com/matthewwithanm/pilkit/actions?query=workflow%3a%22python+ci%22\n\n.. _`pilkit on rtd`: http://pilkit.readthedocs.org\n.. _`instakit`: https://github.com/fish2000/instakit\n\n\ninstallation\n============\n\n1. install `pil`_ or `pillow`_.\n2. run ``pip install pilkit`` (or clone the source and put the pilkit module on\n   your path)\n\n.. note:: if you've never seen pillow before, it considers itself a\n   more-frequently updated \"friendly\" fork of pil that's compatible with\n   setuptools. as such, it shares the same namespace as pil does and is a\n   drop-in replacement.\n\n.. _`pil`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pil\n.. _`pillow`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pillow\n\n\nusage overview\n==============\n\n\nprocessors\n----------\n\nthe \"pilkit.processors\" module contains several classes for processing pil\nimages, which provide an easy to understand api:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from pilkit.processors import resizetofit\n\n    img = image.open('/path/to/my/image.png')\n    processor = resizetofit(100, 100)\n    new_img = processor.process(img)\n\na few of the included processors are:\n\n* ``resizetofit``\n* ``resizetofill``\n* ``smartresize``\n* ``adjust``\n* ``trimbordercolor``\n* ``transpose``\n\nthere's also a ``processorpipeline`` class for executing processors\nsequentially:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from pilkit.processors import processorpipeline, resizetofit, adjust\n\n    img = image.open('/path/to/my/image.png')\n    processor = processorpipeline([adjust(color=0), resizetofit(100, 100)])\n    new_image = processor.process(img)\n\n\nutilities\n---------\n\nin addition to the processors, pilkit contains a few utilities to ease the pain\nof working with pil. some examples:\n\n``prepare_image``\n    prepares the image for saving to the provided format by doing some\n    common-sense conversions, including preserving transparency and quantizing.\n``save_image``\n    wraps pil's ``image.save()`` method in order to gracefully handle pil's\n    \"suspension not allowed here\" errors, and (optionally) prepares the image\n    using ``prepare_image``\n\nutilities are also included for converting between formats, extensions, and\nmimetypes.\n\n\ncommunity\n=========\n\nplease use `the github issue tracker <https://github.com/matthewwithanm/pilkit/issues>`_\nto report bugs. `a mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-imagekit>`_\nalso exists to discuss the project and ask questions, as well as the official\n`#imagekit <irc://irc.freenode.net/imagekit>`_ channel on freenode. (both of\nthese are shared with the `django-imagekit`_ project\u2014from which pilkit spun\noff.)\n\n.. _`django-imagekit`: https://github.com/jdriscoll/django-imagekit\n",
