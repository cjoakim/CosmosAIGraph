  "description": "# db12\n\ndirac benchmark 2012 is a really quick benchmark, originally developed by ricardo graciani (https://github.com/graciani)\nthat uses wrapper functions by andrew mcnab (https://github.com/andrew-mcnab-uk) to run multiple copies in parallel.\nimane iraoui (https://github.com/imanira0ui/) ported it to py3 and added many tests.\nthe current maintainers are federico stagni (https://github.com/fstagni) and alexandre boyer (https://github.com/aldbr).\n\nit is distributed from https://github.com/diracgrid/db12.\n\n# install\n\nto install the db12 package, run:\n\n```bash\npip install db12\n```\n\n# use\n## from the command line interface\n\nyou can execute a single db12 benchmark with the following command:\n\n```bash\ndb12 single\n```\n\nto get further information, read the help:\n\n```bash\ndb12 --help\n```\n\n## from your code\n\nafter installation, the package can be imported by typing:\n\n```python\nfrom db12 import single_dirac_benchmark\nsingle_dirac_benchmark()\n```\n\n# contribute\n## development\n\ndb12 is a fully open source project, and you are welcome to contribute to it:\n- fork the project\n- develop\n- create a pull request to propose a change\n\n## code quality\n\nto ensure the code meets db12's coding conventions we recommend installing pre-commit system wide using your operating system's package manager.\nalteratively, pre-commit is included in the python3 development environment, see the development guide for details on how to create one.\nonce pre-commit is installed you can enable it by running:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install --allow-missing-config\n```\n\ncode formatting will now be automatically applied before each commit.\n\n## score analysis\n\ndb12 has been ported to python3 in october 2021, this created discrepancies in the scores.\nyou might need to run an analysis of the db12 scores to mitigate these discrepancies.\n\nfurther details: [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5647834)\n\n\n",
