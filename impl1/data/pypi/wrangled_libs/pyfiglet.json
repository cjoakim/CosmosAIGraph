e.g. `sudo pyfiglet -l <font file>`.\n\n## **author**\n\nall of the documentation and the majority of the work done was by\nchristopher jones (cjones@insub.org) and many other ccontributors.\npackaged by peter waller (p@pwaller.net), various enhancements by\nstefano rivera (stefano@rivera.za.net),\nand lots of help from many contributors!\n\nthank you all for your efforts, please send a pull request to add yourself to\nthis list if you would like to take credit.\n\n(in the words of the original author) pyfiglet is a **port** of figlet, and much\nof the code is directly translated from the c source. i optimized some bits\nwhere i could, but because the smushing and kerning code is so incredibly\ncomplex, it was safer and easier to port the logic almost exactly. therefore, i\ncan't really take much credit for authorship, just translation. the original\nauthors of figlet are listed on their website at http://www.figlet.org/.\n\nthe python port was done by christopher jones <cjones@insub.org> (http://gruntle.org/).\n\nit is currently maintained by peter waller (p@pwaller.net, github:pwaller)\n\nthe toilet fonts (.tlf) were imported from toilet 0.3-1, by sam hocevar (sam@zoy.org).\n\n## **thanks**\n\nlots of people have helped make pyfiglet what it is but i particularly want to\ncall out.\n\ngithub:stefanor for various bug fixes and improvements and the debian packaging.\ngithub:peterbrittain for helping to close lots of issues.\n\n\n## **license**\nthe mit license (mit)\ncopyright \u00a9 2007-2023\n```\nchristopher jones <cjones@insub.org>\nstefano rivera <stefano@rivera.za.net>\npeter waller <p@pwaller.net>\nand various contributors (see git history).\n```\n(see license for full details)\n",
