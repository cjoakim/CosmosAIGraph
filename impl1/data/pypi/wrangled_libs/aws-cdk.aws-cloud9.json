  "description": "# aws cloud9 construct library\n\n<!--begin stability banner-->---\n\n\n![end-of-support](https://img.shields.io/badge/end--of--support-critical.svg?style=for-the-badge)\n\n> aws cdk v1 has reached end-of-support on 2023-06-01.\n> this package is no longer being updated, and users should migrate to aws cdk v2.\n>\n> for more information on how to migrate, see the [*migrating to aws cdk v2* guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/migrating-v2.html).\n\n---\n<!--end stability banner-->\n\nthis module is part of the [aws cloud development kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.\n\naws cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (ide) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a\nbrowser. it includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular\nprogramming languages, including javascript, python, php, and more, so you don\u2019t need to install files or configure your\ndevelopment machine to start new projects. since your cloud9 ide is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your\noffice, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine. cloud9 also provides a seamless experience for developing\nserverless applications enabling you to easily define resources, debug, and switch between local and remote execution of\nserverless applications. with cloud9, you can quickly share your development environment with your team, enabling you to pair\nprogram and track each other's inputs in real time.\n\n## creating ec2 environment\n\nec2 environments are defined with `ec2environment`. to create an ec2 environment in the private subnet, specify\n`subnetselection` with private `subnettype`.\n\n```python\n# create a cloud9 ec2 environment in a new vpc\nvpc = ec2.vpc(self, \"vpc\", max_azs=3)\ncloud9.ec2environment(self, \"cloud9env\", vpc=vpc)\n\n# or create the cloud9 environment in the default vpc with specific instancetype\ndefault_vpc = ec2.vpc.from_lookup(self, \"defaultvpc\", is_default=true)\ncloud9.ec2environment(self, \"cloud9env2\",\n    vpc=default_vpc,\n    instance_type=ec2.instancetype(\"t3.large\")\n)\n\n# or specify in a different subnetselection\nc9env = cloud9.ec2environment(self, \"cloud9env3\",\n    vpc=vpc,\n    subnet_selection=ec2.subnetselection(\n        subnet_type=ec2.subnettype.private_with_nat\n    )\n)\n\n# print the cloud9 ide url in the output\ncfnoutput(self, \"url\", value=c9env.ide_url)\n```\n\n## cloning repositories\n\nuse `clonedrepositories` to clone one or multiple aws codecommit repositories into the environment:\n\n```python\nimport aws_cdk.aws_codecommit as codecommit\n\n# create a new cloud9 environment and clone the two repositories\n# vpc: ec2.vpc\n\n\n# create a codecommit repository to clone into the cloud9 environment\nrepo_new = codecommit.repository(self, \"reponew\",\n    repository_name=\"new-repo\"\n)\n\n# import an existing codecommit repository to clone into the cloud9 environment\nrepo_existing = codecommit.repository.from_repository_name(self, \"repoexisting\", \"existing-repo\")\ncloud9.ec2environment(self, \"c9env\",\n    vpc=vpc,\n    cloned_repositories=[\n        cloud9.clonerepository.from_code_commit(repo_new, \"/src/new-repo\"),\n        cloud9.clonerepository.from_code_commit(repo_existing, \"/src/existing-repo\")\n    ]\n)\n```\n",
