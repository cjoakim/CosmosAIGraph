  "description": "==================================\npython-multiprocessing\n==================================\n\nabout\n-----\n\n`multiprocessing` is a back port of the python 2.6/3.0 `multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`_\npackage. the multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of \nr oudkerk's `pyprocessing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing/>`_ package.\nthis standalone variant is intended to be compatible with python 2.4 and 2.5, \nand will draw it's fixes/improvements from python-trunk.\n\nthis package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not only\nthe current maintainers but all of the contributors to the original pyprocessing\npackage listed `here <http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/doc/thanks.html>`_\n\nthe multiprocessing package monkey patches several aspects of the `threading`\nmodule to make it forward compatible with python 2.6. the patches are \nnon-intrusive and don't change existing functions. see `multiprocessing.patch`\nfor detailed informations.\n\nplease refer to `<http://www.python.org/doc/2.6/library/multiprocessing.html>`_\nfor more information about the `multiprocessing` package.\n\nbug reporting\n-------------\n\nplease report bugs related to multiprocessing at the `python bug \ntracker <http://bugs.python.org/>`_. issues related to the packaging of\nmultiprocessing should be reported at `<http://code.google.com/p/python-multiprocessing/>`_.\n\n\n===========\nchanges\n===========\n\n2.6.2.1 -- 2009-07-30\n---------------------\n\n * issues #5155, 5313, 5331: multiprocessing.process._bootstrap was\n   unconditionally calling \"os.close(sys.stdin.fileno())\" resulting in file\n   descriptor errors\n\n * issue #5400: added patch for multiprocessing on netbsd compilation/support\n\n * fix and properly document the multiprocessing module's logging\n   support, expose the internal levels and provide proper usage\n   examples.\n\n * issue #5261: patch multiprocessing's semaphore.c to support context\n   manager use: \"with multiprocessing.lock()\" works now.\n\n * issue #3321: _multiprocessing.connection() doesn't check handle; added checks\n   for *nix machines for negative handles and large int handles. without this\n   check it is possible to segfault the interpreter.\n\n * issue #4301: patch the logging module to add processname support, remove\n   _check_logger_class from multiprocessing.\n\n\n2.6.1.1 -- 2009-02-07\n---------------------\n\n * fixed an issue with `make doc`\n\n * mp docs - fix issues 4012,3518,4193 (python svn: r67419)\n\n * issue4238: bsd support for cpu_count (python svn: r67423)\n\n * move definition int sval into branch of ifdef where it is used.\n   otherwise, you get a warning about an undefined variable.\n   (python svn: r67440)\n\n * fixed a segfault in connection_recvbytes_into() which occured\n   with python debug builds on 64bit linux.\n\n * added reference to `issue 1683 http://bugs.python.org/issue1683`_.\n\n * issue 4301: patch logging to add processname, remove the old \n   _check_logger_class code (python svn: r68737)\n\n * resolve issue 3321: (segfault) _multiprocessing.connection() \n   doesn't check handle (python svn: r68768)\n\n * documentation update\n\n\n2.6.0.2 -- 2008-11-27\n---------------------\n\nthe release is based on 2.6.0+ and contains additional fixes\nfrom python svn.\n\n * issue #5: added monkey patch to make the threading module forward \n   compatible with python 2.6 and 3.0.\n \n * python issue #4204: fixed a compilation issue on freebsd 4.\n\n * removed ``install`` target from makefile.\n\n * updated comments of modules/mmapmodules.c. the modifications\n   and origin are clearly marked now.\n\n * added sphinx builder for docs and new make target ``docs``.\n\n * changed version schema to python.version.number.internal_revision\n\n * pulled doc fixes from python svn: r67189, r67330, r67332\n\n\n2.6.0-0.1 -- 2008-10-27\n-----------------------\n\nthe release is based on python 2.6.0.\n\n * initial release",
