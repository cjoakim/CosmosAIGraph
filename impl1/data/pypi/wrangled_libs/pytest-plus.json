  "description": "# pytest plus plugin :: extends pytest functionality\n\n[![pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pytest-plus.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-plus)\n[![python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pytest-plus.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-plus)\n![ci](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-plus/workflows/tox/badge.svg)\n[![python black code style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/python/black)\n\nthis plugin aims to be used to host multiple basic pytest extensions that meet\nthe following criteria:\n\n- downgrade gracefully, meaning that if the plugin is removed, you will still\n  be able to run pytest\n\n## pytest_reqpass\n\nif you define environment variable `pytest_reqpass=123` and at the end of the\ntesting the number of passed tests is\nnot exactly 123, pytest will return exit code 1.\n\nthis feature is aimed for ci usage in order to prevent accidental skipping of\nsome tests. we do expect users to define this variable within their own ci job\ndefinitions. the number of tests executed is likely to be dependent on the ci\njob.\n\nwe discourage defining this inside places like `tox.ini` because when a\ndeveloper runs tests, they are likely to endup running a different number of\ntests. also, this feature makes no sense if you try to mention a specific test.\n\n## avoiding duplicate test function names\n\nwhile pytest allows users to have the same test function names in different\nfiles, that makes it harder to identify and copy/paste the test name in order\nto reproduce the failure locally. that is why this plugin forces its users to\navoid having the same function name anywhere in the tested project.\n\nyou can disable this check by defining `pytest_check_test_duplicate=0`.\n\n## avoiding problematic test identifiers\n\nthis plugin will raise errors when it encounters test ids that are either too\nlong or that contain unsafe characters. while pytest is very flexible in allowing\na wide range of test ids, using these does make development harder as it prevents\npeople from doing a copy/paste with failed test and pasting in in their terminal\nto reproduce the failed test locally.\n\nyou can disable regex check by defining `pytest_check_test_id_regex=0`.\n\nyou can disable the length check by defining `pytest_max_test_id_length=0`.\n\n## release process\n\nreleases are triggered from [github releases](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-plus/releases)\npage.\n\n## links\n\n- [mit](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit)\n- [file an issue](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-plus/issues)\n- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)\n- [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)\n- [pypi](https://pypi.org/project)\n",
