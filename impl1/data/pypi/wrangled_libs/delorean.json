  "description": "\n\n.. image:: http://delorean.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_static/delorean.png\n\ndelorean: time travel made easy\n===============================\n\n`delorean` is a library for clearing up the inconvenient truths that arise dealing with datetimes in python. understanding that timing is a delicate enough of a problem `delorean` hopes to provide a cleaner less troublesome solution to shifting, manipulating, and generating `datetimes`.\n\ndelorean stands on the shoulders of giants `pytz <http://pytz.sourceforge.net/>`_ and `dateutil <http://labix.org/python-dateutil>`_\n\n`delorean` will provide natural language improvements for manipulating time, as well as datetime abstractions for ease of use. the overall goal is to improve datetime manipulations, with a little bit of software and philosophy.\n\npretty much make you a badass time traveller.\n\ngetting started\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nhere is the world without a flux capacitor at your side:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from datetime import datetime\n    import pytz\n\n    est = pytz.timezone('us/eastern')\n    d = datetime.now(pytz.utc)\n    d = est.normalize(d.astimezone(est))\n    return d\n\nnow lets warm up the `delorean`:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from delorean import delorean\n\n    d = delorean()\n    d = d.shift('us/eastern')\n    return d\n\nlook at you looking all fly. this was just a test drive: check out out what else\n`delorean` can help with in the `documentation <http://delorean.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.\n",
