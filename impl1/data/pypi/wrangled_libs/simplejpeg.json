  "description": "\nthis project is in no way affiliated with the\n`libjpeg-turbo <https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo>`_\nproject.\n\n\n\nsimplejpeg\n==========\n\nsimplejpeg is a simple package based on recent versions\nof libturbojpeg for fast jpeg encoding and decoding.\n\n\n\nwhy another library?\n--------------------\n\npillow and opencv are excellent options for handling jpeg\nimages and a variety of other formats.\n\nif all you want is to read or write a couple of images and\ndon't worry about the details, this package is not for you.\n\nkeep reading if you care about speed and want more control\nover how your jpegs are handled.\n\nthese are the reasons why i started making this:\n\n#. pillow is **very** slow compared to opencv.\n#. pillow only accepts streams as input. images in memory\n   have to be wrapped in ``bytesio`` or similar.\n   this adds to the slowness.\n#. opencv is gigantic,\n   only accepts numpy arrays as input,\n   and returns images as bgr instead of rgb.\n#. recent versions of libturbojpeg offer impressive speed\n   gains on modern processors.\n   linux distributions and libraries tend to ship very old\n   versions.\n\n\nthis library is especially for you if you need:\n\n#. speed.\n#. read and write directly from/to memory.\n#. advanced features of the underlying library.\n\n\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\n- on linux (x86/x64), windows (x86/x64), or macos (10.9+, x64)\n  you can simply ``pip install simplejpeg``.\n  update ``pip`` if it wants to build from source anyway.\n- on other platforms you can try to install from source.\n  make sure your system is setup to build cpython extensions\n  and install ``cmake >= 2.8.12``.\n  then run ``pip install simplejpeg`` to install from source.\n- you can also run ``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` etc. as usual.\n\n\n\nusage\n-----\n\nthis library provides four functions:\n\n``decode_jpeg_header``, ``decode_jpeg``, ``encode_jpeg``, ``is_jpeg``.\n\nuncompressed image data is stored as numpy arrays.\ndecoding functions can accept any python object that supports the\n`buffer protocol <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html>`_,\nlike ``array``, ``bytes``, ``bytearray``, ``memoryview``, etc.\n\n\n\ndecode_jpeg_header\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::\n\n    decode_jpeg_header(\n        data: any,\n        min_height: supportsint=0,\n        min_width: supportsint=0,\n        min_factor: supportsfloat=1,\n        strict: bool=true,\n    ) -> (supportsint, supportsint, text, text)\n\n\ndecode only the header of a jpeg image given as jpeg (jfif) data from memory.\naccepts any input that supports the\n`buffer protocol <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html>`_.\nthis is very fast on the order of 100000+ images per second.\nreturns height and width in pixels of the image when decoded,\nand colorspace and subsampling as string.\n\n- data:\n  jpeg data in memory; must support buffer interface\n  (e.g., ``bytes``, ``memoryview``)\n- min_height:\n  minimum height in pixels of the decoded image;\n  values <= 0 are ignored\n- min_width:\n  minimum width in pixels of the decoded image;\n  values <= 0 are ignored\n- min_factor:\n  minimum downsampling factor when decoding to smaller size;\n  factors smaller than 2 may take longer to decode\n- strict:\n  if true, raise valueerror for recoverable errors;\n  default true\n- returns: ``(height: int, width: int, colorspace: str, color subsampling: str)``\n\n\n\ndecode_jpeg\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::\n\n    def decode_jpeg(\n        data: supportsbuffer,\n        colorspace: text='rgb',\n        fastdct: any=false,\n        fastupsample: any=false,\n        min_height: supportsint=0,\n        min_width: supportsint=0,\n        min_factor: supportsfloat=1,\n        buffer: supportsbuffer=none,\n        strict: bool=true,\n    ) -> np.ndarray\n\ndecode a jpeg image given as jpeg (jfif) data from memory.\naccepts any input that supports the\n`buffer protocol <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html>`_.\nreturns the image as numpy array in the requested colorspace.\n\n- data:\n  jpeg data in memory;

================================================================================ content of: /users/runner/work/simplejpeg/simplejpeg/lib/libjpeg-turbo-3.0.0/license.md ================================================================================   libjpeg-turbo licenses ======================  libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible bsd-style open source licenses:  - the ijg (independent jpeg group) license, which is listed in [readme.ijg](readme.ijg)  this license applies to the libjpeg api library and associated programs (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)  - the modified (3-clause) bsd license, which is listed below  this license covers the turbojpeg api library and associated programs, as well as the build system.  - the [zlib license](https://opensource.org/licenses/zlib)  this license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo simd extensions.   complying with the libjpeg-turbo licenses =========================================  this section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the best of our understanding.  1.  if you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then:  1.  you cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices from the source.  **origin** - clause 1 of the ijg license - clause 1 of the modified bsd license - clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib license  2.  you must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)  **origin** - clause 1 of the ijg license - clause 2 of the zlib license  3.  you must include the ijg readme file, and you must not alter any of the copyright or license text in that file.  **origin** - clause 1 of the ijg license  2.  if you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or if you are distributing an application that statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then:  1.  your product documentation must include a message stating:  this software is based in part on the work of the independent jpeg group.  **origin** - clause 2 of the ijg license  2.  if your binary distribution includes or uses the turbojpeg api, then your product documentation must include the text of the modified bsd license (see below.)  **origin** - clause 2 of the modified bsd license  3.  you cannot use the name of the ijg or the libjpeg-turbo project or the contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.  **origin** - ijg license - clause 3 of the modified bsd license  4.  the ijg and the libjpeg-turbo project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable consequences resulting from your use of the software.  **origin** - ijg license - modified bsd license - zlib license   the modified (3-clause) bsd license ===================================  copyright (c)2009-2023 d. r. commander.  all rights reserved.<br> copyright (c)2015 viktor szathm\u00e1ry.  all

following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution. - neither the name of the libjpeg-turbo project nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.  this software is provided by the copyright holders and contributors \"as is\", and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed.  in no event shall the copyright holders or

data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.   why three licenses? ===================  the zlib license could have been used instead of the modified (3-clause) bsd license, and since the ijg license effectively subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib license, this would have effectively placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the ijg license.  however, the ijg license specifically refers to the independent jpeg group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted to the ijg for code derived from their software.

files (in roughly the order listed) before diving into the code.   overview ========  this package contains c software to implement jpeg image encoding, decoding, and transcoding.  jpeg (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression method for full-color and grayscale images.  jpeg's strong suit is compressing photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  images with sharp lines or other abrupt features may not compress well with jpeg, and a higher jpeg quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such images.  jpeg is normally lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to the input pixels.  however, on photographic content and other \"smooth\" images, very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the \"quality\" setting in the compressor.)  this software implements jpeg baseline, extended-sequential, progressive, and lossless compression processes.  provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.  we have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical processes defined in the standard.  we provide a set of library routines for reading and writing jpeg image files, plus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to perform conversion between jpeg and some other popular image file formats. the library is intended to be reused in other applications.  in order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare jpeg coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of jpeg decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays.  these extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.  we have also included \"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different jpeg processes, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in jfif files.  the emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  in particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on jpeg.  (see the references section for introductory material.)  rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  we do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.  we welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. no royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under legal issues.   legal issues ============  in plain english:  1. we don't promise that this software works.  (but if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 2. you can use this software for whatever you want.  you don't have to pay us. 3. you may not pretend that you wrote this software.  if you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the ijg code.  in legalese:  the authors make no warranty or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  this software is provided \"as is\", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.  this software is copyright (c) 1991-2020, thomas g. lane, guido vollbeding. all rights reserved except as specified below.  permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) if any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this readme file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) if only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of the independent jpeg group\". (3) permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept no liability for damages of any kind.  these conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the ijg code, not just to the unmodified library.  if you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.  permission is not granted for the use of any ijg author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  this software may be referred to only as \"the independent jpeg group's software\".  we specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.   references ==========  we recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to understand the innards of the jpeg software.  the best short technical introduction to the jpeg compression algorithm is wallace, gregory k.  \"the jpeg still picture compression standard\", communications of the acm, april 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44. (adjacent articles in that issue discuss mpeg motion picture compression, applications of jpeg, and related topics.)  if you don't have the cacm issue handy, a pdf file containing a revised version of wallace's article is available at http://www.ijg.org/files/wallace.jpeg.pdf.  the file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared in ieee trans. consumer electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in cacm, but it includes corrections and some added material.  note: the wallace article is copyright acm and ieee, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.  a somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to jpeg can be found in \"the data compression book\" by mark nelson and jean-loup gailly, published by m&t books (new york), 2nd ed. 1996, isbn 1-55851-434-1.  this book provides good explanations and example c code for a multitude of compression methods including jpeg.  it is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading c code but don't know much about data compression in general.  the book's jpeg sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here...  the best currently available description of jpeg is the textbook \"jpeg still image data compression standard\" by william b. pennebaker and joan l. mitchell, published by van nostrand reinhold, 1993, isbn 0-442-01272-1. price us$59.95, 638 pp.  the book includes the complete text of the iso jpeg standards (dis 10918-1 and draft dis 10918-2).  the original jpeg standard is divided into two parts, part 1 being the actual specification, while part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  part 1 is titled \"digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images, part 1: requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers iso/iec is 10918-1, itu-t t.81.  part 2 is titled \"digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images, part 2: compliance testing\" and has document numbers iso/iec is 10918-2, itu-t t.83.  the jpeg standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format.  for the omitted details, we follow the \"jfif\" conventions, revision 1.02.  jfif version 1 has been adopted as iso/iec 10918-5 (05/2013) and recommendation itu-t t.871 (05/2011): information technology - digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: jpeg file interchange format (jfif).  it is available as a free download in pdf file format from https://www.iso.org/standard/54989.html and http://www.itu.int/rec/t-rec-t.871. a pdf file of the older jfif 1.02 specification is available at http://www.w3.org/graphics/jpeg/jfif3.pdf.  the tiff 6.0 file format specification can be obtained from http://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/tiff/tiff6.ps.gz.  the jpeg incorporation scheme found in the tiff 6.0 spec of 3-june-92 has a number of serious problems.  ijg does not recommend use of the tiff 6.0 design (tiff compression tag 6).  instead, we recommend the jpeg design proposed by tiff technical note #2 (compression tag 7).  copies of this note can be obtained from http://www.ijg.org/files/.  it is expected that the next revision of the tiff spec will replace the 6.0 jpeg design with the note's design. although ijg's own code does not support tiff/jpeg, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement tiff/jpeg per the note.   archive locations =================  the \"official\" archive site for this software is www.ijg.org. the most recent released version can always be found there in directory \"files\".  the jpeg faq (frequently asked questions) article is a source of some general information about jpeg.  it is available at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq.   file format compatibility =========================  this software implements itu t.81 | iso/iec 10918 with some extensions from itu t.871 | iso/iec 10918-5 (jpeg file interchange format-- see references). informally, the term \"jpeg image\" or \"jpeg file\" most often refers to jfif or a subset thereof, but there are other formats containing the name \"jpeg\" that are incompatible with the original jpeg standard or with jfif (for instance, jpeg 2000 and jpeg xr).  this software therefore does not support these formats.  indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on a common, interoperable format standard for jpeg files.  jfif is a minimal or \"low end\" representation.  tiff/jpeg (tiff revision 6.0 as modified by tiff technical note #2) can be used for \"high end\" applications that need to record a lot of additional data about an image.   to do =====  please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@jpegclub.org.
