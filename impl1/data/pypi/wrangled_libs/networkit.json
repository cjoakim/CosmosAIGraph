  "description": "\nnetworkit is a growing open-source toolkit for high-performance network analysis.\nits aim is to provide tools for the analysis of large networks in the size range\nfrom thousands to billions of edges. for this purpose, it implements efficient\ngraph algorithms, many of them parallel to utilize multicore architectures. these\nare meant to compute standard measures of network analysis, such as degree\nsequences, clustering coefficients and centrality. in\nthis respect, networkit is comparable to packages such as networkx, albeit with a\nfocus on parallelism and scalability. networkit is also a testbed for algorithm\nengineering and contains a few novel algorithms from recently published\nresearch, especially in the area of community detection.\n\n",
