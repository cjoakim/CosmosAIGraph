  "description": "# microsoft azure sdk for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure dns private zones client library.\nthis package has been tested with python 3.7+.\nfor a more complete view of azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).\n\n## _disclaimer_\n\n_azure sdk python packages support for python 2.7 has ended 01 january 2022. for more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_\n\n## getting started\n\n### prerequisites\n\n- python 3.7+ is required to use this package.\n- [azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)\n\n### install the package\n\n```bash\npip install azure-mgmt-privatedns\npip install azure-identity\n```\n\n### authentication\n\nby default, [azure active directory](https://aka.ms/awps/aad) token authentication depends on correct configure of following environment variables.\n\n- `azure_client_id` for azure client id.\n- `azure_tenant_id` for azure tenant id.\n- `azure_client_secret` for azure client secret.\n\nin addition, azure subscription id can be configured via environment variable `azure_subscription_id`.\n\nwith above configuration, client can be authenticated by following code:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.mgmt.privatedns import privatednsmanagementclient\nimport os\n\nsub_id = os.getenv(\"azure_subscription_id\")\nclient = privatednsmanagementclient(credential=defaultazurecredential(), subscription_id=sub_id)\n```\n\n## examples\n\ncode samples for this package can be found at:\n- [search dns private zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=getting%20started%20-%20managing&terms=getting%20started%20-%20managing) on docs.microsoft.com\n- [azure python mgmt sdk samples repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)\n\n\n## troubleshooting\n\n## next steps\n\n## provide feedback\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the\n[issues](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project. \n\n\n![impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fazure-mgmt-privatedns%2freadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 1.1.0 (2023-05-20)\n\n### features added\n\n  - model privatezone has a new parameter internal_id\n\n## 1.1.0b1 (2022-10-28)\n\n### features added\n\n  - model privatezone has a new parameter internal_id\n\n## 1.0.0 (2021-03-25)\n\n- ga release\n\n## 1.0.0b1 (2021-02-09)\n\nthis is beta preview version.\nfor detailed changelog please refer to equivalent stable version 10.2.0 (https://pypi.org/project/azure-mgmt-network/10.2.0/)\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\n- credential system has been completly revamped:\n\n  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\n  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`\n\n- the `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. example: `myclient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=true)`. for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n- you can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead\n- operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.lropoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.lropoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.\n- exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror` (`clouderror` has been removed).\n- most of the operation kwarg have changed. some of the most noticeable:\n\n  - `raw` has been removed. equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal http response for advanced user\n  - for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n\n**general new features**\n\n- type annotations support using `typing`. sdks are mypy ready.\n- this client has now stable and official support for async. check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.\n- this client now support natively tracing library like opencensus or opentelemetry. see this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.\n\n\n## 0.1.0 (2019-02-26)\n\n  - initial release\n",
