  "description": "# parselmouth - praat in python, the pythonic way\n\n**parselmouth** is a python library for the [praat](http://www.praat.org)\nsoftware.\n\nthough other attempts have been made at porting functionality from praat to\npython, parselmouth is unique in its aim to provide a complete and pythonic\ninterface to the internal praat code. while other projects either wrap praat's\nscripting language or reimplementing parts of praat's functionality in python,\nparselmouth directly accesses praat's c/c++ code (which means the algorithms\nand their output are exactly the same as in praat) and provides efficient\naccess to the program's data, but *also* provides an interface that looks\nno different from any other python library.\n\ndrop by our [gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/praatparselmouth/lobby) or\npost a message to our\n[google discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/parselmouth) if\nyou have any question, remarks, or requests!\n\nmore information on the **installation** and some basic **examples**\ncan be found on parselmouth's github repository:\nhttps://github.com/yannickjadoul/parselmouth\n\n\n",
