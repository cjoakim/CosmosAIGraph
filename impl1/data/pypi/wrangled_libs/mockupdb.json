  "description": "========\nmockupdb\n========\n\nmock server for testing mongodb clients and creating mongodb wire protocol\nservers.\n\n* documentation: http://mockupdb.readthedocs.org/\n\n\n\n\nchangelog\n=========\n\n1.8.1 (2021-10-14)\n------------------\n\nfix a bug where mockupdb did not recognize the op_msg exhaustallowed flag.\n\n1.8.0 (2020-09-26)\n------------------\n\nmockupdb supports python 3.4 through 3.8; it no longer supports python 2.6 or\npython 3.3.\n\nnew method ``mockupdb.append_responder`` to add an autoresponder of last resort.\n\nfix a bug in ``interactive_server`` with ``all_ok=true``. it had returned an\nempty ismaster response, causing drivers to throw errors like \"server at\nlocalhost:27017 reports wire version 0, but this version of pymongo requires at\nleast 2 (mongodb 2.6).\"\n\nstop logging \"oserror: [winerror 10038] an operation was attempted on something\nthat is not a socket\" on windows after a client disconnects.\n\nparse op_msgs with any number of sections in any order. this allows write\ncommands from the mongo shell, which sends sections in the opposite order from\ndrivers. handle op_msgs with checksums, such as those sent by the mongo shell\nbeginning in 4.2.\n\n1.7.0 (2018-12-02)\n------------------\n\nimprove datetime support in match expressions. python datetimes have microsecond\nprecision but bson only has milliseconds, so expressions like this always\nfailed::\n\n  server.receives(command('foo', when=datetime(2018, 12, 1, 6, 6, 6, 12345)))\n\nnow, the matching logic has been rewritten to recurse through arrays and\nsubdocuments, comparing them value by value. it compares datetime values with\nonly millisecond precision.\n\n1.6.0 (2018-11-16)\n------------------\n\nremove vendored bson library. instead, require pymongo and use its bson library.\nthis avoids surprising problems where a bson type created with pymongo does not\nappear equal to one created with mockupdb, and it avoids the occasional need to\nupdate the vendored code to support new bson features.\n\n1.5.0 (2018-11-02)\n------------------\n\nsupport for unix domain paths with ``uds_path`` parameter.\n\nthe ``interactive_server()`` function now prepares the server to autorespond to\nthe ``getfreemonitoringstatus`` command from the mongo shell.\n\n1.4.1 (2018-06-30)\n------------------\n\nfix an inadvertent dependency on pymongo, which broke the docs build.\n\n1.4.0 (2018-06-29)\n------------------\n\nsupport, and expect, op_msg requests from clients. thanks to shane harvey for\nthe contribution.\n\nupdate vendored bson library from pymongo. support the decimal128 bson type. fix\nmatcher so it equates bson objects from pymongo like ``objectid(...)`` with\nequivalent objects created from mockupdb's vendored bson library.\n\n1.3.0 (2018-02-19)\n------------------\n\nsupport windows. log a traceback if a bad client request causes an assert. fix\nssl. make errors less likely on shutdown. enable testing on travis and appveyor.\nfix doctests and interactive server for modern mongodb protocol.\n\n1.2.1 (2017-12-06)\n------------------\n\nset minwireversion to 0, not to 2. i had been wrong about mongodb 3.6's wire\nversion range: it's actually 0 to 6. mockupdb now reports the same wire version\nrange as mongodb 3.6 by default.\n\n1.2.0 (2017-09-22)\n------------------\n\nupdate for mongodb 3.6: report minwireversion 2 and maxwireversion 6 by default.\n\n1.1.3 (2017-04-23)\n------------------\n\navoid rare runtimeerror in close(), if a client thread shuts down a socket as\nmockupdb iterates its list of sockets.\n\n1.1.2 (2016-08-23)\n------------------\n\nproperly detect closed sockets so ``mockupdb.stop()`` doesn't take 10 seconds\nper connection. thanks to sean purcell.\n\n1.1.1 (2016-08-01)\n------------------\n\ndon't use \"client\" as a keyword arg for ``request``, it conflicts with the\nactual \"client\" field in drivers' new handshake protocol.\n\n1.1.0 (2016-02-11)\n------------------\n\nadd cursor_id property to opgetmore, and ssl parameter to interactive_server.\n\n1.0.3 (2015-09-12)\n------------------\n\n``mockupdb(auto_ismaster=true)`` had just responded ``{\"ok\": 1}``, but this\nisn't enough to convince pymongo 3 it's talking to a valid standalone,\nso auto-respond ``{\"ok\": 1, \"ismaster\": true}``.\n\n1.0.2 (2015-09-11)\n------------------\n\nrestore request.assert_matches method, used in pymongo-mockup-tests.\n\n1.0.1 (2015-09-11)\n------------------\n\nallow co-installation with pymongo.\n\n1.0.0 (2015-09-10)\n------------------\n\nfirst release.\n\n0.1.0 (2015-02-25)\n------------------\n\ndevelopment begun.\n\n\n",
