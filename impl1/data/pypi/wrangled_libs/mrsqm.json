  "description": "# mrsqm: fast time series classification with symbolic representations\n\nmrsqm (multiple representations sequence miner) is a time series classifier. the \nmrsqm method can quickly extract features from multiple symbolic representations of time series and train a linear classification model with logistic regression. the method has four variants with four different feature selection strategies:\n\n  * mrsqm-r: random feature selection.\n  * mrsqm-rs: mrsqm-r with a follow-up chi2 test to filter less important features.\n  * mrsqm-s: pruning the all-subsequence feature space with a chi2 bound and selecting the optimal set of top *k* subsequences.\n  * mrsqm-sr: random sampling of the features from the output of mrsqm-s.\n\n## installation\n\ndependencies\n```\ncython >= 0.29\nnumpy >= 1.18\npandas >= 1.0.3\nscikit-learn >= 0.22\nfftw3 (http://www.fftw.org/)\n```\n## installation using pip\npip install mrsqm\n\n\n## installation from source\ndownload the repository: \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/mlgig/mrsqm.git\n```\nmove into the code directory of the repository: \n```\ncd mrsqm/mrsqm\n```\nbuild package from source using: \n```\npip install .\n```\n## example\n\nload data from arff files\n```\nx_train,y_train = util.load_from_arff_to_dataframe(\"data/coffee/coffee_train.arff\")\nx_test,y_test = util.load_from_arff_to_dataframe(\"data/coffee/coffee_test.arff\")\n```\ntrain with mrsqm\n```\nclf = mrsqmclassifier(nsax=0, nsfa=5)\nclf.fit(x_train,y_train)\n```\n\nmake predictions\n```\npredicted = clf.predict(x_test)\n```\n\n![alt](explanation-mrsqm-example.png) \n\nmore examples can be found in the *example* directory, including a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mlgig/mrsqm/blob/main/example/time_series_classification_and_explanation_with_mrsqm.ipynb) with detailed steps for training, prediction and \nexplanation.\nthe full uea and ucr archive can be downloaded from http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/.\n\n\nthis repository provides supporting code, results and instructions for reproducing the work presented in our publication:\n\n\"fast time series classification with random symbolic subsequences\", thach le nguyen and georgiana ifrim\nhttps://project.inria.fr/aaltd22/files/2022/08/aaltd22_paper_5778.pdf\n\n\"mrsqm: fast time series classification with symbolic representations and efficient sequence mining\", thach le nguyen and georgiana ifrim\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01036\n\n## citation\nif you use this work, please cite as:\n```\n@article{mrsqm2022,\n  title={fast time series classification with random symbolic subsequences},\n  author={le nguyen, thach and ifrim, georgiana},\n  year={2022},\n  booktitle = {aaltd},\n  url = {https://project.inria.fr/aaltd22/files/2022/08/aaltd22_paper_5778.pdf},\n  publisher={springer}\n}\n@article{mrsqm2022-extended,\n  title={mrsqm: fast time series classification with symbolic representations and efficient sequence mining},\n  author={le nguyen, thach and ifrim, georgiana},\n  year={2022},\n  booktitle = {arxvi},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01036},\n  publisher={}\n}\n```\n",
