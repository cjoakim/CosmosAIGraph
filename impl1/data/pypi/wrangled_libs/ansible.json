configuration management, application\ndeployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node\norchestration. ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers\neasy. more information on the ansible `website <https://ansible.com/>`_.\n\nthis is the ``ansible`` community package.\nthe ``ansible`` python package contains a set of\nindependent ansible collections that are curated by the community,\nand it pulls in `ansible-core <https://pypi.org/project/ansible-core/>`_.\nthe ``ansible-core`` python package contains the core runtime and cli tools,\nsuch as ``ansible`` and ``ansible-playbook``,\nwhile the ``ansible`` package contains extra modules, plugins, and roles.\n\n``ansible`` follows `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.\neach major version of ``ansible`` depends on a specific major version of\n``ansible-core`` and contains specific major versions of the collections it\nincludes.\n\ndesign principles\n=================\n\n*  have an extremely simple setup process and a minimal learning curve.\n*  manage machines quickly and in parallel.\n*  avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by\n   leveraging the existing ssh daemon.\n*  describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human\n   friendly.\n*  focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.\n*  manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any\n   software.\n*  allow module development in any dynamic language, not just python.\n*  be usable as non-root.\n*  be the easiest it automation system to use, ever.\n\nuse ansible\n===========\n\nyou can install a released version of ansible with ``pip`` or a package manager. see our\n`installation guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html>`_ for details on installing ansible\non a variety of platforms.\n\nreporting issues\n================\nissues with plugins and modules in the ansible package should be reported\non the individual collection's issue tracker.\nissues with ``ansible-core`` should be reported on\nthe `ansible-core issue tracker <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/>`_.\n\nrefer to the `communication page\n<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html>`_ for a\nlist of support channels if you need assistance from the community or are\nunsure where to report your issue.\n\n\nget involved\n============\n\n*  read `community information <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community>`_ for ways to contribute to \n   and interact with the project, including mailing list information and how\n   to submit bug reports and code to ansible or ansible collections.\n*  join a `working group <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki>`_, an organized community\n   devoted to a specific technology domain or platform.\n*  talk to us before making larger changes\n   to avoid duplicate efforts. this not only helps everyone\n   know what is going on, but it also helps save time and effort if we decide\n   some changes are needed.\n*  for a list of email lists,  matrix and irc channels, and working groups, see the\n   `communication page <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html>`_\n\ncoding guidelines\n=================\n\nwe document our coding guidelines in the `developer guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/>`_. we also suggest you review:\n\n* `developing modules checklist <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_checklist.html>`_\n* `collection contributor guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/contributions_collections.html>`_\n\nbranch info\n===========\n\n*  the ansible package is a 'batteries included' package that brings in ``ansible-core`` and a curated set of collections. ansible uses `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ (for example, ansible 5.6.0). \n*  the ansible package has only one stable branch, called 'latest' in the documentation.\n*  see `ansible release and maintenance <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html>`_  for information about active branches and their corresponding ``ansible-core`` versions.\n*  refer to the\n   `ansible-build-data <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/>`_\n   repository for the exact versions of ``ansible-core`` and collections that\n   are included in each ``ansible`` release.\n\nroadmap\n=======\n\nbased on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published for a major \nversion (example: 5, 6).  the `ansible roadmap \n<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/ansible_roadmap_index.html>`_ details what is planned and how to influence the\nroadmap.\n\nauthors\n=======\n\nansible was created by `michael dehaan <https://github.com/mpdehaan>`_\nand has contributions from over 4700 users (and growing). thanks everyone!\n\n`ansible <https://www.ansible.com>`_ is sponsored by `red hat, inc.\n<https://www.redhat.com>`_\n\nlicense\n=======\n\ngnu general public license v3.0 or later\n\nsee `copying
