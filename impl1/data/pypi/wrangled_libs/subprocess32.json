  "description": "this is a backport of the subprocess standard library module from\npython 3.2 - 3.5 for use on python 2.\n\nit includes bugfixes and some new features.  on posix systems it is\nguaranteed to be reliable when used in threaded applications.\nit includes timeout support from python 3.3 and the run() api from 3.5\nbut otherwise matches 3.2's api.\n\nit has not been tested by the author on windows.\n\non python 3, it merely redirects the subprocess32 name to subprocess.\n\n",
