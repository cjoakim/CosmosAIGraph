``cmake-format`` project provides quality assurance (qa) tools\nfor ``cmake``:\n\n\n* ``cmake-annotate`` can generate pretty html from your listfiles\n\n* ``cmake-format`` can format your listfiles nicely so that they don't\n  look like crap.\n\n* ``cmake-lint`` can check your listfiles for problems\n\n* ``ctest-to`` can parse a ctest output tree and translate it into a\n  more structured format (either json or xml).\n\n------------\ninstallation\n------------\n\ninstall from ``pypi`` using ``pip``::\n\n    pip install cmakelang\n\nor see the `online documentation`__ for additional options.\n\n.. __: https://cmake-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\n\n------------\nintegrations\n------------\n\n* there is an official `vscode extension`__\n* someone also created a `sublime plugin`__\n* you can add ``cmake-format`` to your ``pre-commit`` configuration__\n\n.. __: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=cheshirekow.cmake-format\n.. __: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/cmakeformat\n.. __: https://cmake-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#pre-commit\n\n-----\nusage\n-----\n\n.. dynamic: format-usage-short-begin\n\n.. code:: text\n\n    usage:\n    cmake-format [-h]\n                 [--dump-config {yaml,json,python} | -i | -o outfile_path]\n                 [-c config_file]\n                 infilepath [infilepath ...]\n\n    parse cmake listfiles and format them nicely.\n\n    formatting is configurable by providing a configuration file. the configuration\n    file can be in json, yaml, or python format. if no configuration file is\n    specified on the command line, cmake-format will attempt to find a suitable\n    configuration for each ``inputpath`` by checking recursively checking it's\n    parent directory up to the root of the filesystem. it will return the first\n    file it finds with a filename that matches '\\.?cmake-format(.yaml|.json|.py)'.\n\n    cmake-format can spit out the default configuration for you as starting point\n    for customization. run with `--dump-config [yaml|json|python]`.\n\n    positional arguments:\n      infilepaths\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -v, --version         show program's version number and exit\n      -l {error,warning,info,debug}, --log-level {error,warning,info,debug}\n

{lex,parse,parsedb,layout,markup}\n      --no-help             when used with --dump-config, will omit helptext\n                            comments in the output\n      --no-default          when used with --dump-config, will omit any unmodified\n                            configuration value.\n      -i, --in-place\n      --check               exit with status code 0 if formatting would not

format.\nan example configuration file is given `in the online documentation`__.\nproviding the structure of your custom commands will help ``cmake-format`` to\nbreak them up in a pleasant way, and will help `cmake-lint` detect improper\nusages of them.\n\n.. __: https://cmake-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html\n\nan example short configuration file in python format is:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # -----------------------------\n    # options effecting formatting.\n    # -----------------------------\n    with section(\"format\"):\n\n      # how wide to allow formatted cmake files\n      line_width = 80\n\n      # how many spaces to tab for indent\n      tab_size = 2\n\n      # if true, separate flow control names from their parentheses with a space\n      separate_ctrl_name_with_space = false\n\n      # if true, separate function names from parentheses with a space\n      separate_fn_name_with_space = false\n\n      # if a statement is wrapped to more than one line, than dangle the closing\n      # parenthesis on its own line.\n      dangle_parens = false\n\nyou may specify a path to one or more configuration files with the\n``--config-file`` command line option. otherwise, ``cmake-format`` will search\nthe ancestry of each ``infilepath`` looking for a configuration file to use.\nif no configuration file is found it will use sensible defaults.\n\na automatically detected configuration files may have any name that matches\n``\\.?cmake-format(.yaml|.json|.py)``.\n\nif you'd like to create a new configuration file, ``cmake-format`` can help\nby dumping out the default configuration in your preferred format. you can run\n``cmake-format --dump-config [yaml|json|python]`` to print the default\nconfiguration ``stdout`` and use that as a starting point.\n\n.. dynamic: features-begin\n\n-------\nmarkup\n-------\n\n``cmake-format`` is for the exceptionally lazy. it will even format your\ncomments for you. it will reflow your comment text to within the configured\nline width. it also understands a very limited markup format for a couple of\ncommon bits.\n\n**rulers**: a ruler is a line which starts with and ends with three or more\nnon-alphanum or space characters::\n\n    # ---- this is a ruler ----\n    # cmake-format will know to keep the ruler separated from the\n    # paragraphs around it. so it wont try to reflow this text as\n    # a single paragraph.\n    # ---- this is also a ruler ---\n\n\n**list**: a list is started on the first encountered list item, which starts\nwith a bullet character (``*``) followed by a space followed by some text.\nsubsequent lines will be included in the list item until the next list item\nis encountered (the bullet must be at the same indentation level). the list\nmust be surrounded by a pair of empty lines. nested lists will be formatted in\nnested text::\n\n    # here are some lists:\n    #\n    # * item 1\n    # * item 2\n    #\n    #   * subitem 1\n    #   * subitem 2\n    #\n    # * second list item 1\n    # * second list item 2\n\n**enumerations**: an enumeration is similar to a list but the bullet character\nis some integers followed by a period. new enumeration items are detected as\nlong as either the first digit or the punctuation lines up in the same column\nas the previous item. ``cmake-format`` will renumber your items and align their\nlabels for you::\n\n    # this is an enumeration\n    #\n    #   1. item\n    #   2. item\n    #   3. item\n\n**fences**: if you have any text which you do not want to be formatted you can\nguard it with a pair of fences. fences are three or more tilde characters::\n\n    # ~~~\n    # this comment is fenced\n    #   and will not be formatted\n    # ~~~\n\nnote that comment fences guard reflow of *comment text*, and not cmake code.\nif you wish to prevent formatting of cmake, code, see below. in addition to\nfenced-literals, there are three other ways to preserve comment text from\nmarkup and/or reflow processing:\n\n* the ``--first-comment-is-literal`` configuration option will exactly preserve\n  the first comment in the file. this is intended to preserve copyright or\n  other formatted header comments.\n* the ``--literal-comment-pattern`` configuration option allows for a more\n  generic way to identify comments which should be preserved literally. this\n  configuration takes a regular expression pattern.\n* the ``--enable-markup`` configuration option globally enables comment markup\n  processing. it defaults to true so set it to false if you wish to globally\n  disable comment markup processing. note that trailing whitespace is still\n  chomped from comments.\n\n--------------------------\ndisable formatting locally\n--------------------------\n\nyou can locally disable and enable code formatting by using the special\ncomments ``# cmake-format: off`` and ``# cmake-format: on``.\n\n-------------------\nsort argument lists\n-------------------\n\nstarting with version `0.5.0`, ``cmake-format`` can sort your argument lists\nfor you. if the configuration includes ``autosort=true`` (the default), it\nwill replace::\n\n    add_library(foobar static exclude_from_all\n                sourcefile_06.cc\n                sourcefile_03.cc\n                sourcefile_02.cc\n                sourcefile_04.cc\n                sourcefile_07.cc\n                sourcefile_01.cc\n                sourcefile_05.cc)\n\nwith::\n\n    add_library(foobar static exclude_from_all\n                sourcefile_01.cc\n                sourcefile_02.cc\n                sourcefile_03.cc\n                sourcefile_04.cc\n                sourcefile_05.cc\n                sourcefile_06.cc\n                sourcefile_07.cc)\n\nthis is implemented for any argument lists which the parser knows are\ninherently sortable. this includes the following cmake commands:\n\n* ``add_library``\n* ``add_executable``\n\nfor most other cmake commands, you can use an annotation comment to hint to\n``cmake-format`` that the argument list is sortable. for instance::\n\n    set(sources\n        # cmake-format: sortable\n        bar.cc\n        baz.cc\n        foo.cc)\n\nannotations can be given in a line-comment or a bracket comment. there is a\nlong-form and a short-form for each. the acceptable formats are:\n\n+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+\n| line comment    | long  | ``# cmake-format: <tag>``    |\n+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+\n| line comment    | short | ``# cmf: <tag>``             |\n+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+\n| bracket comment | long  | ``#[[cmake-format: <tag>]]`` |\n+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+\n| bracket comment | short | ``#[[cmf: <tag>]]``          |\n+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+\n\nin order to annotate a positional argument list as sortable, the acceptable\ntags are: ``sortable`` or ``sort``. for the commands listed above where\nthe positinal argument lists are inherently sortable, you can locally disable\nsorting by annotating them with ``unsortable`` or ``unsort``. for example::\n\n    add_library(foobar static\n                # cmake-format: unsort\n                sourcefile_03.cc\n                sourcefile_01.cc\n                sourcefile_02.cc)\n\nnote that this is only needed if your configuration has enabled ``autosort``,\nand you can globally disable sorting by making setting this configuration to\n``false``.\n\n\n---------------\ncustom commands\n---------------\n\ndue to the fact that cmake is a macro language, `cmake-format` is, by\nnecessity, a *semantic* source code formatter. in general it tries to make\nsmart formatting decisions based on the meaning of arguments in an otherwise\nunstructured list of arguments in a cmake statement. `cmake-format` can\nintelligently format your custom commands, but you will need to tell it how\nto interpret your arguments.\n\ncurrently, you can do this by adding your command specifications to the\n`additional_commands` configuration variables, e.g.:\n\n.. code::\n\n    # additional flags and kwargs for custom commands\n    additional_commands = {\n      \"foo\": {\n        \"pargs\": 2,\n        \"flags\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"],\n        \"kwargs\": {\n          \"headers\": '*',\n          \"sources\": '*',\n          \"depends\": '*',\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nthe format is a nested dictionary mapping statement names (dictionary keys)\nto `argument specifications`__. for the example specification above, the\ncustom command would look something like this:\n\n.. code::\n\n   foo(hello world\n       headers a.h b.h c.h d.h\n       sources a.cc b.cc c.cc d.cc\n       depends flub buzz bizz\n       bar baz)\n\n\n.. __: https://cmake-format.rtfd.io/en/latest/custom_parsers.html\n.. dynamic: features-end\n\n---------------------------------\nreporting issues and getting
