  "description": "diskcache: disk backed cache\n============================\n\n`diskcache`_ is an apache2 licensed disk and file backed cache library, written\nin pure-python, and compatible with django.\n\nthe cloud-based computing of 2023 puts a premium on memory. gigabytes of empty\nspace is left on disks as processes vie for memory. among these processes is\nmemcached (and sometimes redis) which is used as a cache. wouldn't it be nice\nto leverage empty disk space for caching?\n\ndjango is python's most popular web framework and ships with several caching\nbackends. unfortunately the file-based cache in django is essentially\nbroken. the culling method is random and large caches repeatedly scan a cache\ndirectory which slows linearly with growth. can you really allow it to take\nsixty milliseconds to store a key in a cache with a thousand items?\n\nin python, we can do better. and we can do it in pure-python!\n\n::\n\n   in [1]: import pylibmc\n   in [2]: client = pylibmc.client(['127.0.0.1'], binary=true)\n   in [3]: client[b'key'] = b'value'\n   in [4]: %timeit client[b'key']\n\n   10000 loops, best of 3: 25.4 \u00b5s per loop\n\n   in [5]: import diskcache as dc\n   in [6]: cache = dc.cache('tmp')\n   in [7]: cache[b'key'] = b'value'\n   in [8]: %timeit cache[b'key']\n\n   100000 loops, best of 3: 11.8 \u00b5s per loop\n\n**note:** micro-benchmarks have their place but are not a substitute for real\nmeasurements. diskcache offers cache benchmarks to defend its performance\nclaims. micro-optimizations are avoided but your mileage may vary.\n\ndiskcache efficiently makes gigabytes of storage space available for\ncaching. by leveraging rock-solid database libraries and memory-mapped files,\ncache performance can match and exceed industry-standard solutions. there's no\nneed for a c compiler or running another process. performance is a feature and\ntesting has 100% coverage with unit tests and hours of stress.\n\ntestimonials\n------------\n\n`daren hasenkamp`_, founder --\n\n    \"it's a useful, simple api, just like i love about redis. it has reduced\n    the amount of queries hitting my elasticsearch cluster by over 25% for a\n    website that gets over a million users/day (100+ hits/second).\"\n\n`mathias petermann`_, senior linux system engineer --\n\n    \"i implemented it into a wrapper for our ansible lookup modules and we were\n    able to speed up some ansible runs by almost 3 times. diskcache is saving\n    us a ton of time.\"\n\ndoes your company or website use

https://github.com/grantjenks/python-diskcache/actions?query=workflow%3arelease\n\nquickstart\n----------\n\ninstalling `diskcache`_ is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::\n\n  $ pip install diskcache\n\nyou can access documentation in the interpreter with python's built-in help\nfunction::\n\n  >>> import diskcache\n  >>> help(diskcache)                             # doctest: +skip\n\nthe core of `diskcache`_ is three data types intended for caching. `cache`_\nobjects manage a sqlite database and filesystem directory to store key and\nvalue pairs. `fanoutcache`_ provides a sharding layer to utilize multiple\ncaches and `djangocache`_ integrates that with `django`_::\n\n  >>> from diskcache import cache, fanoutcache, djangocache\n  >>> help(cache)                                 # doctest: +skip\n  >>> help(fanoutcache)                           # doctest: +skip\n  >>> help(djangocache)                           # doctest: +skip\n\nbuilt atop the caching data types, are `deque`_ and `index`_ which work as a\ncross-process, persistent replacements for python's ``collections.deque`` and\n``dict``. these implement the sequence and mapping container base classes::\n\n  >>> from diskcache import deque, index\n  >>> help(deque)                                 # doctest: +skip\n  >>> help(index)                                 # doctest: +skip\n\nfinally, a number of `recipes`_ for cross-process synchronization are provided\nusing an underlying cache. features like memoization with cache stampede\nprevention, cross-process locking, and cross-process throttling are available::\n\n  >>> from diskcache import memoize_stampede, lock, throttle\n  >>> help(memoize_stampede)                      # doctest: +skip\n  >>> help(lock)                                  # doctest: +skip\n  >>> help(throttle)                              # doctest: +skip\n\npython's docstrings are a quick way to get started but not intended as a\nreplacement

is mostly a simple key-value store. feature comparisons with four\nother projects are shown in the tables below.\n\n* `dbm`_ is part of python's standard library and implements a generic\n  interface to variants of the dbm database \u2014 dbm.gnu or dbm.ndbm. if none of\n  these modules is installed, the slow-but-simple dbm.dumb is used.\n* `shelve`_ is part of python's standard library and implements a \u201cshelf\u201d as a\n  persistent, dictionary-like object. the difference with \u201cdbm\u201d databases is\n  that the values can be anything that the pickle module can handle.\n* `sqlitedict`_ is a lightweight wrapper around python's sqlite3 database with\n  a simple, pythonic dict-like interface and support for multi-thread\n  access. keys are arbitrary strings, values arbitrary pickle-able objects.\n* `pickledb`_ is a lightweight and simple key-value store. it is built upon\n  python's simplejson module and was inspired by redis. it is licensed with the\n  bsd three-clause license.\n\n.. _`dbm`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dbm.html\n.. _`shelve`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html\n.. _`sqlitedict`:

https://pandas.pydata.org/\n.. _`sorted containers`: http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/\n\npure-python databases\n.....................\n\n* `zodb`_ supports an isomorphic interface for database operations which means\n  there's little impact on your code to make objects persistent and there's no\n  database mapper that partially hides the datbase.\n* `codernitydb`_ is an open source, pure-python, multi-platform, schema-less,\n  nosql database and includes an http server version, and a python client\n  library that aims to be 100% compatible with the embedded version.\n* `tinydb`_ is a tiny, document oriented database optimized for your\n  happiness. if you need a simple database with a clean api that just works\n  without lots of configuration, tinydb might be the right choice for you.\n\n.. _`zodb`: http://www.zodb.org/\n.. _`codernitydb`: https://pypi.org/project/codernitydb/\n.. _`tinydb`: https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/\n\nobject relational mappings (orm)\n................................\n\n* `django orm`_ provides models that are the single, definitive source of\n  information about data and contains the essential fields and behaviors of the\n  stored data. generally, each model maps to a single sql database table.\n* `sqlalchemy`_ is the python sql toolkit and object relational mapper that\n  gives application developers the full power and flexibility of sql. it\n  provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns.\n* `peewee`_ is a simple and small orm. it has few (but expressive) concepts,\n  making it easy to learn and intuitive to use. peewee supports sqlite, mysql,\n  and postgresql with tons of extensions.\n* `sqlobject`_ is a popular object relational manager for providing an object\n  interface to your database, with tables as classes, rows as instances, and\n  columns as attributes.\n* `pony orm`_ is a python orm with beautiful query syntax. use python syntax\n  for interacting with the database. pony translates such queries into sql and\n  executes them in the database in the most efficient way.\n\n.. _`django orm`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/\n.. _`sqlalchemy`: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\n.. _`peewee`: http://docs.peewee-orm.com/\n.. _`sqlobject`: http://sqlobject.org/\n.. _`pony orm`: https://ponyorm.com/\n\nsql databases\n.............\n\n* `sqlite`_ is part of python's standard library and provides a lightweight\n  disk-based database that doesn\u2019t require a separate server process and allows\n  accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the sql query language.\n* `mysql`_ is one of the world\u2019s most popular open source databases and has\n  become a leading database choice for web-based applications. mysql includes a\n  standardized database driver for python platforms and development.\n* `postgresql`_ is a powerful, open source object-relational database system\n  with over 30 years of active development. psycopg is the most popular\n  postgresql adapter for the python programming language.\n* `oracle db`_ is a relational database management system (rdbms) from the\n  oracle corporation. originally developed in 1977, oracle db is one of the\n  most trusted and widely used enterprise relational database engines.\n* `microsoft sql server`_ is a relational database management system developed\n  by microsoft.
