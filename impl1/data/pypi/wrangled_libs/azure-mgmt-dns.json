  "description": "# microsoft azure sdk for python\n\nthis is the microsoft azure dns management client library.\nthis package has been tested with python 3.7+.\nfor a more complete view of azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).\n\n## _disclaimer_\n\n_azure sdk python packages support for python 2.7 has ended 01 january 2022. for more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_\n\n## getting started\n\n### prerequisites\n\n- python 3.7+ is required to use this package.\n- [azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)\n\n### install the package\n\n```bash\npip install azure-mgmt-dns\npip install azure-identity\n```\n\n### authentication\n\nby default, [azure active directory](https://aka.ms/awps/aad) token authentication depends on correct configure of following environment variables.\n\n- `azure_client_id` for azure client id.\n- `azure_tenant_id` for azure tenant id.\n- `azure_client_secret` for azure client secret.\n\nin addition, azure subscription id can be configured via environment variable `azure_subscription_id`.\n\nwith above configuration, client can be authenticated by following code:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import defaultazurecredential\nfrom azure.mgmt.dns import dnsmanagementclient\nimport os\n\nsub_id = os.getenv(\"azure_subscription_id\")\nclient = dnsmanagementclient(credential=defaultazurecredential(), subscription_id=sub_id)\n```\n\n## examples\n\ncode samples for this package can be found at:\n- [search dns management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=getting%20started%20-%20managing&terms=getting%20started%20-%20managing) on docs.microsoft.com\n- [azure python mgmt sdk samples repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)\n\n\n## troubleshooting\n\n## next steps\n\n## provide feedback\n\nif you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the\n[issues](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\nsection of the project. \n\n\n![impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2fazure-mgmt-dns%2freadme.png)\n\n\n# release history\n\n## 8.1.0 (2023-06-14)\n\n### features added\n\n  - added operation group dnssecconfigsoperations\n  - model recordset has a new parameter ds_records\n  - model recordset has a new parameter naptr_records\n  - model recordset has a new parameter tlsa_records\n  - model zone has a new parameter signing_keys\n  - model zone has a new parameter system_data\n\n## 8.1.0b1 (2023-02-10)\n\n### other changes\n\n  - added generated samples in github repo\n  - drop support for python<3.7.0\n\n## 8.0.0 (2021-04-14)\n\n - ga release\n\n## 8.0.0b1 (2021-03-10)\n\nthis is beta preview version.\nfor detailed changelog please refer to equivalent stable version 10.2.0 (https://pypi.org/project/azure-mgmt-network/10.2.0/)\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\n- credential system has been completly revamped:\n\n  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/\n  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`\n\n- the `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. example: `myclient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=true)`. for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n- you can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead\n- operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.lropoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.lropoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.\n- exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.httpresponseerror` (`clouderror` has been removed).\n- most of the operation kwarg have changed. some of the most noticeable:\n\n  - `raw` has been removed. equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal http response for advanced user\n  - for a complete set of\n  supported options, see the [parameters accept in request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/client_library_developer.md#available-policies)\n\n**general new features**\n\n- type annotations support using `typing`. sdks are mypy ready.\n- this client has now stable and official support for async. check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.\n- this client now support natively tracing library like opencensus or opentelemetry. see this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.\n\n\n## 3.0.0 (2019-06-18)\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*\nintroduce breaking changes if you were importing from the v20xx_yy_zz\napi folders. in summary, some modules were incorrectly\nvisible/importable and have been renamed. this fixed several issues\ncaused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the\nfirst place.\n\n  - dnsmanagementclient cannot be imported from\n    `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.dns_management_client` anymore\n    (import from `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz` works like before)\n  - dnsmanagementclientconfiguration import has been moved from\n    `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.dns_management_client` to\n    `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz`\n  - a model `myclass` from a \"models\" sub-module cannot be imported\n    anymore using `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.models.my_class`\n    (import from `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.models` works like\n    before)\n  - an operation class `myclassoperations` from an `operations`\n    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using\n    `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.operations.my_class_operations`\n    (import from `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.operations` works like\n    before)\n\nlast but not least, http connection pooling is now enabled by default.\nyou should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or\nuse no more than one client per process.\n\n## 2.1.0 (2018-09-10)\n\n**features**\n\n  - model recordset has a new parameter target_resource\n  - added operation group dnsresourcereferenceoperations\n\n## 2.0.0 (2018-07-01)\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n  - fix arm compliance (correct settings of location, tags, etc.)\n\n## 2.0.0rc2 (2018-07-05)\n\n**features**\n\n  - client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying\n    http session open for performance\n\n**general breaking changes**\n\nthis version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*\nintroduce breaking changes.\n\n  - model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. all\n    positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments. to\n    keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for\n    python 2 and python 3. python 3 uses the \"*\" syntax for\n    keyword-only arguments.\n  - enum types now use the \"str\" mixin (class azureenum(str, enum)) to\n    improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.\n    while this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important,\n    and are documented here:\n    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others> at a glance:\n      - \"is\" should not be used at all.\n      - \"format\" will return the string value, where \"%s\" string\n        formatting will return `nameofenum.stringvalue`. format syntax\n        should be prefered.\n  - new long running operation:\n      - return type changes from\n        `msrestazure.azure_operation.azureoperationpoller` to\n        `msrest.polling.lropoller`. external api is the same.\n      - return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.lropoller`,\n        regardless of the optional parameters used.\n      - the behavior has changed when using `raw=true`. instead of\n        returning the initial call result as `clientrawresponse`,\n        without polling, now this returns an lropoller. after polling,\n        the final resource will be returned as a `clientrawresponse`.\n      - new `polling` parameter. the default behavior is\n        `polling=true` which will poll using arm algorithm. when\n        `polling=false`, the response of the initial call will be\n        returned without polling.\n      - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of\n        `msrest.polling.pollingmethod`.\n      - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after\n        polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right\n        away.\n\n**bugfixes**\n\n  - compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0\n\n## 2.0.0rc1 (2018-03-14)\n\n**features**\n\n  - add public/private zone\n  - add record_sets.list_all_by_dns_zone operation\n  - add zones.update operation\n\n**breaking changes**\n\n  - 'zone_type' is now required when creating a zone ('public' is\n    equivalent as previous behavior)\n\nnew api version 2018-03-01-preview\n\n## 1.2.0 (2017-10-26)\n\n  - add record_type caa\n  - remove pointless return type of delete\n\napi version moves from 2016-04-01 to 2017-09-01\n\n## 1.1.0 (2017-10-10)\n\n  - add \"recordsetnamesuffix\" filter parameter to list operations\n\n## 1.0.1 (2017-04-20)\n\nthis wheel package is now built with the azure wheel extension\n\n## 1.0.0 (2016-12-12)\n\n  - initial release\n\n",
