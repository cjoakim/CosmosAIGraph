  "description": "..   -*- mode: rst -*-\n\n#################\nvirtualenvwrapper\n#################\n\nvirtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to ian bicking's `virtualenv\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ tool.  the extensions include\nwrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise\nmanaging your development workflow, making it easier to work on more\nthan one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their\ndependencies.\n\n**warning:** the 4.x release includes some potentially incompatible\nchanges for extensions from 3.x. the python modules for extensions are\nnow *always* run with ``pwd=$workon_home`` (previously the value of\npwd varied depending on the hook). the *shell* portion of any hook\n(anything sourced by the user's shell when the hook is run) is still\nrun in the same place as before.\n\n========\nfeatures\n========\n\n1.  organizes all of your virtual environments in one place.\n\n2.  wrappers for creating, copying and deleting environments, including\n    user-configurable hooks.\n\n3.  use a single command to switch between environments.\n\n4.  tab completion for commands that take a virtual environment as\n    argument.\n\n5. user-configurable hooks for all operations.\n\n6. plugin system for more creating sharable extensions.\n\nrich leland has created a short `screencast\n<http://mathematism.com/2009/07/30/presentation-pip-and-virtualenv/>`__\nshowing off the features of virtualenvwrapper.\n\n============\ninstallation\n============\n\nsee the `project documentation\n<https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for\ninstallation and setup instructions.\n\nsupported shells\n================\n\nvirtualenvwrapper is a set of shell *functions* defined in bourne\nshell compatible syntax.  it is tested under ``bash``, ``ksh``, and ``zsh``.\nit may work with other shells, so if you find that it does work with a\nshell not listed here please let me know.  if you can modify it to\nwork with another shell, without completely rewriting it, send a pull\nrequest through the bitbucket project page.  if you write a clone to\nwork with an incompatible shell, let me know and i will link to it\nfrom this page.\n\npython versions\n===============\n\nvirtualenvwrapper is tested under python 2.6 - 3.6.\n\n=======\nsupport\n=======\n\njoin the `virtualenvwrapper google group\n<http://groups.google.com/group/virtualenvwrapper/>`__ to discuss\nissues and features.\n\nreport bugs via the `bug tracker on bitbucket\n<https://bitbucket.org/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper/issues>`__.\n\nshell aliases\n=============\n\nsince virtualenvwrapper is largely a shell script, it uses shell\ncommands for a lot of its actions.  if your environment makes heavy\nuse of shell aliases or other customizations, you may encounter\nissues.  before reporting bugs in the bug tracker, please test\n*without* your aliases enabled.  if you can identify the alias causing\nthe problem, that will help make virtualenvwrapper more robust.\n\n==========\nchange log\n==========\n\nthe `release history`_ is part of the project documentation.\n\n.. _release history: https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html\n\n\n=======\nlicense\n=======\n\ncopyright doug hellmann, all rights reserved\n\npermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its\ndocumentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,\nprovided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and that\nboth that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in\nsupporting documentation, and that the name of doug hellmann not be used\nin advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the software\nwithout specific, written prior permission.\n\ndoug hellmann disclaims all warranties with regard to this software,\nincluding all implied warranties of merchantability and fitness, in no\nevent shall doug hellmann be liable for any special, indirect or\nconsequential damages or any damages whatsoever resulting from loss of\nuse, data or profits, whether in an action of contract, negligence or\nother tortious action, arising out of or in connection with the use or\nperformance of this software.",
