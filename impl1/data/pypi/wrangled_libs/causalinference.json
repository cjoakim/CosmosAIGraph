  "description": "causal inference in python\n==========================\n\n*causal inference in python*, or *causalinference* in short, is a software package that implements various statistical and econometric methods used in the field variously known as causal inference, program evaluation, or treatment effect analysis.\n\nwork on *causalinference* started in 2014 by laurence wong as a personal side project. it is distributed under the 3-clause bsd license.\n\nimportant links\n===============\n\nthe official website for *causalinference* is\n\n  https://causalinferenceinpython.org\n\nthe most current development version is hosted on github at\n\n  https://github.com/laurencium/causalinference\n\npackage source and binary distribution files are available from pypi at\n\n  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/causalinference\n\nfor an overview of the main features and uses of *causalinference*, please refer to\n\n  https://github.com/laurencium/causalinference/blob/master/docs/tex/vignette.pdf\n\na blog dedicated to providing a more detailed walkthrough of *causalinference* and the econometric theory behind it can be found at\n\n  https://laurencewong.com/software/\n\nmain features\n=============\n\n* assessment of overlap in covariate distributions\n* estimation of propensity score\n* improvement of covariate balance through trimming\n* subclassification on propensity score\n* estimation of treatment effects via matching, blocking, weighting, and least squares\n\ndependencies\n============\n\n* numpy: 1.8.2 or higher\n* scipy: 0.13.3 or higher\n\ninstallation\n============\n\n*causalinference* can be installed using ``pip``: ::\n\n  $ pip install causalinference\n\nfor help on setting up pip, numpy, and scipy on macs, check out this excellent `guide <http://www.sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup>`_.\n\nminimal example\n===============\n\nthe following illustrates how to create an instance of causalmodel: ::\n\n  >>> from causalinference import causalmodel\n  >>> from causalinference.utils import random_data\n  >>> y, d, x = random_data()\n  >>> causal = causalmodel(y, d, x)\n\ninvoking ``help`` on ``causal`` at this point should return a comprehensive listing of all the causal analysis tools available in *causalinference*.\n\n\n\n",
