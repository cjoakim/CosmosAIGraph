  "description": "# streamlit-aggrid\n\n[![open in streamlit][share_badge]][share_link] [![github][github_badge]][github_link] [![pypi][pypi_badge]][pypi_link]\n\n---\n\n**note**\n\nfolks, i wish i had more time to work on this.. but, i'm still bound to those 24 hours a day have, and vey busy days.\ni'm writing this on my free time, most features i'm adding are what i found necessary to implement on the projects i'm\nusing streamlit ag-grid. i check the issues here and the pr once in a while, and try to focus on what's more requested.\ni'm working on documentation and some examples too. [check here](https://staggrid-examples.streamlit.app/)\n\n> \"i'm just a latin american young man  \n> no money in the bank no important relatives  \n> and coming from the countryside\" [\u266b](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hlpjaatyh4)\n\n---\n\n**aggrid** is an awesome grid for web frontend. more information in [https://www.ag-grid.com/](https://www.ag-grid.com/). consider purchasing a license from ag-grid if you are going to use enterprise features!\n\ncomment on [discuss.streamlit.io](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/ag-grid-component-with-input-support/) if you like it or [buy me a beer \ud83c\udf7a!](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=8hgla4jzbyfpq)\n\n<br>\nlive example [on streamlit cloud](https://pablocfonseca-streamlit-aggrid-examples-example-jyosi3.streamlitapp.com/). some basic documentation is available: https://streamlit-aggrid.readthedocs.io\n\n# install\n\n```\npip install streamlit-aggrid\n\n```\n\n# quick use\n\ncreate an example.py file\n\n```python\nfrom st_aggrid import aggrid\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv')\naggrid(df)\n```\n\nrun :\n\n```shell\nstreamlit run example.py\n```\n\n# demo\n\ngrid data is sent back to streamlit and can be reused in other components. in the example below a chart is updated on grid edition.\n\n![example image](https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/raw/main/group_selection_example.gif)\n\n# development notes\n\nversion 0.3.4\n\n- added quickfilter\n- added excel export module\n- bugfixes (an probably introduced new ones :/)\n- code cleanup\n- updated ag-grit to 29.1.0 (including ag-grid-react) which will cause direct html returns to stop rendering ([#198](https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/198)). use a [cellrenderer](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/component-cell-renderer/) instead.\n\nversion 0.3.3\n\n- fixes [#132](https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/132)\n- fixes [#131](https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/131) and [#130](https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/130)\n- added sparklines [#118](https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/118)\n- changed grid return to support [#117](https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/117)\n- rebuilt streamlit theme\n\nversion 0.3.0\n\n- merged some pr (thanks everybody!) check pr at github!\n- added class parsing in react side, so more advanced cellrenderers can be used. (thanks [kjakaitis](https://github.com/kjakaitis))\n- added gridoptionsbuilder.configure_first_column_as_index() to, well, style the first columns as an index (multiindex to come!)\n- improved serialization performance by using simpler pandas to_json method (pr #62, #85)\n- added option to render plain json instead of pd.dataframes\n- gridoptions may be loaded from file paths or strings\n- gridreturn is now a @dataclass with rowindex added to selected_rows, (previous version returned only the selected data, now you can know which row was selected)\n- changed gridreturnmode behavior. now update_on accepts a list of gridevents that will trigger a streamlit refresh, making it possible to subscribe to any [gridevent](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-events/).\n- removed dot-env and simplejson dependencies.\n- other smaller fixes and typos corrections.\n\nversion 0.2.3\n\n- small fixes\n- merged pr #44 and #25 (thanks [msabramo](https://github.com/msabramo) and [ljnsn](https://github.com/ljnsn))\n- merged pr #58 - allow nesting dataframes. included an example in exampes folder.\n\nversion 0.2.2\n\n- updated frontend dependencies to latest version\n- corrected text color for better viz when using streamlit theme (thanks [jasonpmcculloch](https://github.com/jasonpmcculloch))\n- switched default theme to balham light ('light'), if you want to use streamlit theme set `theme='streamlit'` on aggrid call\n\nversion 0.2.0\n\n- support themes\n- incorporated pull requests with fixes and pre-select rows (thanks [randomseed42](https://github.com/randomseed42) and [msabramo](https://github.com/msabramo))\n- you can use strings instead of importing gridupdatemode and datareturnmode enumerators\n- it works fine with st.forms!\n- new theme example in example folder\n\nversion 0.1.9\n\n- small fixes\n- organized examples folder\n\nversion 0.1.8\n\n- fixes a bug that breaks the grid when nan or inf values are present in the data\n\nversion 0.1.7\n\n- fixes a bug that happened when converting data back from the grid with only one row\n- added license_key parameter on aggrid call.\n\nversion 0.1.6\n\n- fixes issue [#3](https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/3)\n- adds support for timedelta columns check [example][share_link]\n\nversion 0.1.5\n\n- small bug fixes\n- there is an option to avoid grid re-initialization on app update (check fixed_key_example.py on examples folder or [here](https://share.streamlit.io/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/main/examples/fixed_key_example.py))\n\nversion 0.1.3\n\n- fixed bug where cell was blank after edition.\n- added enable_enterprise_modules argument to aggrid call for enabling/disabling [enterprise features](https://www.ag-grid.com/documentation/javascript/licensing/)\n- it is now possible to inject js functions on gridoptions. enabling advanced customizations such as conditional formatting (check 4<sup>th</sup> column on the [example](share_link))\n\nversion 0.1.2\n\n- added customcurrencyformat as column type\n\nversion 0.1.0:\n\n- i worked a little bit more on making the example app functional.\n- couple configuration options for update mode (how frontend updates streamlit) and for data returns (grid should return data filtered? sorted?)\n- some basic level of row selection\n- added some docstrings specially on gridoptionsbuilder methods\n- lacks performance for production. js client code is slow...\n\n[share_badge]: https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg\n[share_link]: https://share.streamlit.io/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/main/examples/example.py\n[github_badge]: https://badgen.net/badge/icon/github?icon=github&color=black&label\n[github_link]: https://github.com/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid\n[pypi_badge]: https://badgen.net/pypi/v/streamlit-aggrid?icon=pypi&color=black&label?\n[pypi_link]: https://www.pypi.org/project/streamlit-aggrid/\n",
