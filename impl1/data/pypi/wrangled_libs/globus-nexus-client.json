  "description": "disclaimer: this is not an official globus.org product\n======================================================\n\nthis is a personal project for talking to the globus nexus api with all of the\nbenefits of the globus sdk.\nit is not a globus maintained product.\n\nif you don't know what that is, stop reading here and go away.\notherwise, this will hopefully alleviate the pains of trying to use nexus.\n\n\nglobus nexus client\n===================\n\nwhen globus added the new `sdk <https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python>`_\nit did not include functionality for the nexus api.\n\nthis package contains a client for talking to nexus, based on the same core\nclient model provided by the sdk.\nyou should therefore think of this as a third-party extension to the sdk for\ntalking to nexus.\n\nimporting and usage\n-------------------\n\n.. warning::\n\n    because this is not part of the sdk, you don't get at it with a simple\n    ``from globus_sdk import nexusclient``.\n\ninstead, imports come from the package namespace::\n\n    from globus_nexus_client import nexusclient\n\nyou can then use ``nexusclient`` methods as usual.\n\nthe client object supports all of the typical authorizers that the sdk\nprovides, and this package provides an additional authorizer for using\nnexus-issued tokens::\n\n    from globus_nexus_client import nexusclient, legacygoauthauthorizer\n\n    client = nexusclient(authorizer=legacygoauthauthorizer('<nexus token>'))\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nthere is no web doc or other maintained documentation for this project, but\nthere are docstrings on all methods of the client object. either browse the\nsource or use ``help()`` in the python repl.\n\n\n",
