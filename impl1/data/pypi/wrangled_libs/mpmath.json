denormal rounding is currently not available\n  at all.\n\n* the interface for switching precision and rounding is not finalized.\n  the current method is not threadsafe.\n\n5. help and bug reports\n-----------------------\n\ngeneral questions and comments can be sent to the mpmath mailinglist,\nmpmath@googlegroups.com\n\nyou can also report bugs and send patches to the mpmath issue tracker,\nhttps://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath/issues\n",
