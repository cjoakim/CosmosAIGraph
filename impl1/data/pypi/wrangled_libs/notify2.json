  "description": "this is a pure-python replacement for notify-python, using python-dbus\nto communicate with the notifications server directly. it's compatible with\npython 2 and 3, and its callbacks can work with gtk 3 or qt 4 applications.\n\nto use it, first call ``notify2.init('app name')``, then create and show notifications::\n\n    n = notify2.notification(\"summary\",\n                             \"some body text\",\n                             \"notification-message-im\"   # icon name\n                            )\n    n.show()\n\napi docs are `available on readthedocs <https://notify2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_,\nor you can refer to docstrings.\n\nbased on the notifications spec at:\nhttp://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/\n\nporting applications from pynotify\n----------------------------------\n\nthere are a few differences from pynotify you should be aware of:\n\n- if you need callbacks from notifications, notify2 must know about your event\n  loop. the simplest way is to pass 'glib' or 'qt' as the ``mainloop`` parameter\n  to ``init``.\n- the methods ``attach_to_widget`` and ``attach_to_status_icon`` are not\n  implemented. you can calculate the location you want the notification to\n  appear and call ``notification``.\n- ``set_property`` and ``get_property`` are not implemented. the summary, body\n  and icon are accessible as attributes of a ``notification`` instance.\n- various methods that pynotify notification instances got from gobject do not\n  exist, or only implement part of the functionality.\n\nseveral pynotify functions, especially getters and setters, are only supported\nfor compatibility. you are encouraged to use more direct, pythonic alternatives.\n\n\n",
